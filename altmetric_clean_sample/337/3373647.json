The synflorescence is thyrsoid. Partial inflorescences are rhipidia with up to three flowers. The ochrealike stipule is formed by the fusion of two lateral stipules, which forms an adaxial ligule-like structure and a two-flanked leaf sheath that encircles the parental axis. The leaf sheath elongates with the growth of the preceding internode. Although sympodial growth and a sheathing leaf base are present in all Piperales (Aristolochiaceae, Lactoridaceae, Piperaceae, and Saururaceae), the presence of stipules is confined to Lactoris, Saururaceae, and some Piperaceae. These characters are consistent with the placement of Lactoris within Piperales, although its phylogenetic position within the order remains equivocal, except for the possible sister group relationship suggested by the presence of cymose inflorescences in both Lactoris and Aristolochiaceae.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ee","authors":["Favio Gonz\u00e1lez","Paula Rudall"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T02:42:31+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1537-2197","0002-9122"],"issue":"12","journal":"American Journal of Botany","last_mentioned_on":1220544398,"links":["http:\/\/www.amjbot.org\/cgi\/content\/full\/88\/12\/2143","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21669646"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.amjbot.org\/content\/88\/12\/2143.full.pdf","pmid":"21669646","pubdate":"2001-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"The questionable affinities of Lactoris: evidence from branching pattern, inflorescence morphology, and stipule development.","type":"article","volume":"88","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/questionable-affinities-lactoris-evidence-branching-pattern-inflorescence-morphology-stipule-develop"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632299,"mean":4.9243828402896,"rank":816003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294021,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632299,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94405,"mean":8.1101301851618,"rank":24549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94405,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1359,"mean":3.9558748159057,"rank":297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":604,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1359,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":10.474,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1,"Associate Professor":1,"Post Doc":2,"Ph.D. Student":1,"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)":1,"Other Professional":1,"Student (Master)":1,"Student (Bachelor)":1,"Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Biological Sciences":10}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Lactoris","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=236259480#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3373647,3373650],"posted_on":"2008-09-04T16:06:38+00:00","summary":"Lactoris fernandeziana is a flowering shrub endemic to the cloud forest of Masatierra \u2014 Robinson Crusoe Island, of the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands archipelago.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=3961357","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"DOI bot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:DOI bot"}}]}}
