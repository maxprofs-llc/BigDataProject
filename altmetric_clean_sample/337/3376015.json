In 2005, three laboratories showed that ribosome-recycling factor (RRF) and elongation factor G (EF-G) cause dissociation of ribosomes into subunits, solving the long-standing problem of how this essential step of translation occurs. However, there remains ongoing controversy regarding the other actions of RRF and EF-G during ribosome recycling. We propose that the available data are consistent with the notion that RRF and EF-G not only split ribosomes into subunits but also participate directly in the release of deacylated tRNA and mRNA for the next round of translation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036a4","authors":["Go Hirokawa","Natalia Demeshkina","Nobuhiro Iwakura","Hideko Kaji","Akira Kaji"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tibs.2006.01.007","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T03:56:55+00:00","issns":["09680004"],"issue":"3","journal":"Trends in Biochemical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1301712000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tibs.2006.01.007","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16487710"],"pmid":"16487710","pubdate":"2006-02-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The ribosome-recycling step: consensus or controversy?","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ribosomerecycling-step-consensus-controversy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628714,"mean":4.9390391673343,"rank":816838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628714,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93902,"mean":8.074927189274,"rank":24312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93902,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":921,"mean":3.3211869565217,"rank":139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":921,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":3.5666666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
