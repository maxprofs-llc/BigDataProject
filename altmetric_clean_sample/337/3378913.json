The plasma concentration profile of brotizolam can be described as a one compartmental open model with first-order absorption. The absorption of triazolam was less regular and in half of the subjects was not consistent with first-order kinetics. Inter-individual variability in absorption rate (peak times) was larger for brotizolam. Mean peak times were 1.1 +\/- 1.0 h for brotizolam and 1.2 +\/- 0.5 h for triazolam. Mean peak concentrations were 7.3 +\/- 3.1 ng\/ml and 5.0 +\/- 3.9 ng\/ml respectively. The elimination half-life of brotizolam was twice that of triazolam with mean values of 5.0 +\/- 1.1 h and 2.6 +\/- 0.7 h respectively. There was no correlation between the half-lives of the two drugs. Protein unbound fraction was similar for triazolam and brotizolam with mean values of 9.9 +\/- 1.5% and 8.4 +\/- 0.7% respectively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000243e","authors":["R Jochemsen","J G Wesselman","C J van Boxtel","J Hermans","D D Breimer"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T05:33:55+00:00","issns":["0306-5251"],"journal":"British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1254355160,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6140948","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1428224"],"pmcid":"PMC1428224","pmid":"6140948","pubdate":"1983-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Comparative pharmacokinetics of brotizolam and triazolam in healthy subjects","type":"article","volume":"16 Suppl 2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-pharmacokinetics-brotizolam-triazolam-healthy-subjects"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630815,"mean":4.9285062716012,"rank":816195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630815,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94253,"mean":8.1071055256124,"rank":24476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94253,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1167,"mean":4.201910806175,"rank":226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":643,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1167,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.6333333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
