This protein is designated Grap for Grb2-related adaptor protein. The single 2.3-kilobase (kb) grap transcript was expressed predominantly in thymus and spleen, while the ubiquitously expressed grb2 gene produced two mRNA species of 3.8 and 1.5 kb. Grap and Grb2 consist of 217 amino acids and share 59% amino acid sequence identity, with highest homology in the N-terminal SH3 domain. The GrapSH2 domain interacts with ligand-activated receptors for stem cell factor (c-kit) and erythropoietin (EpoR). Grap also forms a stable complex with the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein via its SH2 domain in K562 cells. Furthermore, Grap is associated with a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor mSos1, primarily through its N-terminal SH3 domain. These results show that a family of Grb2-like proteins exist and couple signals from receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases to the Ras signaling pathway.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["G S Feng","Y B Ouyang","D P Hu","Z Q Shi","R Gentz","J Ni"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T03:19:37+00:00","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"21","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1248108344,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8647802"],"pmid":"8647802","pubdate":"1996-05-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Grap is a novel SH3-SH2-SH3 adaptor protein that couples tyrosine kinases to the Ras pathway.","type":"article","volume":"271","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/grap-novel-sh3sh2sh3-adaptor-protein-couples-tyrosine-kinases-ras-pathway"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4335299,"mean":4.931929451188,"rank":985578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2782410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4335299,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141955,"mean":8.0744096820098,"rank":40641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":99494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141955,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29922,"mean":2.5018319574881,"rank":2060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":12812,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29922,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":346,"mean":3.3411072463768,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":346,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
