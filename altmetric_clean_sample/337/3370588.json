Significant improvement was seen on a picture recognition test with physostigmine 0.375 mg and arecholine 4 mg. A trend towards improvement was also seen with physostigmine 0.25 mg and 0.75 mg, and arecholine 2 mg. For the majority of the patients improvement was only slight but in two patients it was clear cut and consistent.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057a0","authors":["J E Christie","A Shering","J Ferguson","A I Glen"],"doi":"10.1192\/bjp.138.1.46","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T01:15:24+00:00","issns":["1472-1465","0007-1250"],"journal":"British Journal of Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1211981984,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1192\/bjp.138.1.46","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7023592"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bjp.rcpsych.org\/content\/138\/1\/46.full.pdf","pmid":"7023592","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Physostigmine and arecoline: effects of intravenous infusions in Alzheimer presenile dementia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physostigmine-arecoline-effects-intravenous-infusions-alzheimer-presenile-dementia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3617832,"mean":4.9277809930899,"rank":815405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2278731,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3617832,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92098,"mean":7.1218256837899,"rank":23307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":67719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92098,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2362,"mean":7.6355569673867,"rank":1008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2362,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":10.867307692308,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Psychology":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Arecoline","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=215497587#altmetric_citation_5","license":"public","citation_ids":[3370588],"posted_on":"2008-05-28T13:39:44+00:00","summary":"Arecoline is a nicotinic acids-based alkaloid found in the areca nut, the fruit of the areca palm (Areca catechu).","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=3396634","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"DOI bot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:DOI bot"}}]}}
