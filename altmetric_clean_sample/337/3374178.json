When the LHR does not work properly, ovulation does not occur in females and Leydig cells do not develop normally in the male. Also, because the LHR is essential for sustaining the elevated levels of progesterone needed to maintain pregnancy during the first trimester, disruptions in the functions of the LHR during pregnancy have catastrophic consequences. As such, a full understanding of the biology of the LHR is essential to the survival of our species. In this review we summarize our current knowledge of the structure, functions, and regulation of this important receptor.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f61000727e","authors":["Mario Ascoli","Francesca Fanelli","Deborah L Segaloff"],"doi":"10.1210\/edrv.23.2.0462","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T02:56:39+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0163-769X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Endocrine Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1193859780,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11943741"],"pmid":"11943741","pubdate":"2002-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"The lutropin\/choriogonadotropin receptor, a 2002 perspective.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lutropinchoriogonadotropin-receptor-2002-perspective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622349,"mean":4.9308753696201,"rank":815966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2282719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622349,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92745,"mean":7.3090901954865,"rank":23545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92745,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":306,"mean":3.9823672131148,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":306,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.0833333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
