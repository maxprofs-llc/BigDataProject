Several studies indicate that AAS affect the brain reward system. Recently chronic administration with nandrolone decanoate to male rats has been shown to increase the dopamine transporter (DAT) density in the striatum visualised in vivo by positron emission tomography. The present study aimed to investigate if the increased DAT density could be confirmed using in vitro autoradiography following a comparable regimen of nandrolone treatment. Specific binding of 50 pM [125I] RTI-55 in the presence of 1 microM citalopram was used to label DAT. Two weeks of nandrolone decanoate administration at the supra-therapeutic doses 1, 5 and 15 mg\/kg per day increased DAT density in the caudate putamen at all three doses. In conclusion, this study confirms that chronic nandrolone administration increases dopamine transporter density in the CPU and therefore supports the theory that AAS affects the dopamine system in the male rat brain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031ac","authors":["Anna M S Kindlundh","Sadia Rahman","Jonas Lindblom","Fred Nyberg"],"first_seen_on":"2014-01-08T13:52:53+00:00","issns":["0304-3940"],"issue":"2","journal":"Neuroscience Letters","last_mentioned_on":1389189158,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/14746881\/"],"pmid":"14746881","pubdate":"2004-02-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Increased dopamine transporter density in the male rat brain following chronic nandrolone decanoate administration.","type":"article","volume":"356","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-dopamine-transporter-density-male-rat-brain-following-chronic-nandrolone-decanoate-adminis-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3063832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943540,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122891,"mean":7.6223853690295,"rank":80495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":27426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122891,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2163,"mean":2.5351369102683,"rank":1358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2163,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":1.3122641509434,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/libikavanah\/status\/420915955985022976","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2028929],"posted_on":"2014-01-08T13:52:38+00:00","author":{"name":"libi kavanah","url":"http:\/\/www.libikavanah.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/539161527295557633\/7euORN2X_normal.jpeg","description":"Naturalist Mystery Writer.                                  \nCompassion Activist \nCultural Geographer \nDedicated to keeping the Wild, Wild","id_on_source":"libikavanah","tweeter_id":"158404969","geo":{"lt":47.26455,"ln":-122.25012,"country":"US"},"followers":553},"tweet_id":"420915955985022976"}]}}
