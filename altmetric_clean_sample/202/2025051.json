Assessment of coping strategies has received increasing attention, with several measures of cognitive and behavioral coping showing promise. One such instrument is the Chronic Pain Coping Inventory (Pain 60 (1995) 203), a 65-item measure of behavioral and cognitive pain coping strategies often targeted as part of multidisciplinary pain treatment. Initial research has supported the reliability and validity of the CPCI. This article describes the development of an abbreviated (42-item) CPCI. The results demonstrate very high correlations between the original and abbreviated CPCI scales, as well as comparable internal consistency, test-retest stability, and validity coefficients. The findings support the reliability and validity of the abbreviated CPCI, and suggest that it could be substituted for the CPCI without sacrificing reliability and validity in situations where a briefer measure of coping with chronic pain is preferable.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003281","authors":["Joan M Romano","Mark P Jensen","Judith A Turner"],"first_seen_on":"2014-01-07T04:24:14+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0304-3959"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Pain (03043959)","last_mentioned_on":1389043620,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12855315"],"pmid":"12855315","pubdate":"2003-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"The Chronic Pain Coping Inventory-42: reliability and validity.","type":"article","volume":"104","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chronic-pain-coping-inventory42-reliability-validity-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.912,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.912},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3684317,"mean":4.9202481350715,"rank":515165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3168939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3684317,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112607,"mean":7.1122761131735,"rank":18148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":94459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112607,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2195,"mean":4.9778158614403,"rank":430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":1730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2195,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":15.730113207547,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
