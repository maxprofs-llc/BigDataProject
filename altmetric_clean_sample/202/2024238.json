In particular, several studies suggest that cannabinoids and endocannabinoids may have a key role in the pathogenesis and therapy of multiple sclerosis (MS). In this study we highlight the main findings reported in literature about the relevance of cannabinoid drugs in the management and treatment of MS. An increasing body of evidence suggests that cannabinoids have beneficial effects on the symptoms of MS, including spasticity and pain. In this report we focus on the effects of cannabinoids in the relief of spasticity describing the main findings in vivo, in the mouse experimental allergic encephalomyelitis model of MS. We report on the current treatments used to control MS symptoms and the most recent clinical studies based on cannabinoid treatments, although long-term studies are required to establish whether cannabinoids may have a role beyond symptom amelioration in MS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082a9","authors":["Anna Maria Malfitano","Maria Chiara Proto","Maurizio Bifulco"],"first_seen_on":"2014-01-06T23:12:00+00:00","issns":["1176-6328"],"issue":"5","journal":"Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1505868085,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2626929\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2626929\/#!po=73.2323","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2626929\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2626929\/?tool=pmcentrez"],"pmcid":"PMC2626929","pmid":"19183777","pubdate":"2008-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"847","title":"Cannabinoids in the management of spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cannabinoids-management-spasticity-associated-multiple-sclerosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.95,"score_history":{"1y":2.95,"6m":2.1,"3m":2.1,"1m":1.85,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440460,"mean":7.0979179556386,"rank":1486484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6949795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440460,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187314,"mean":7.3222461228001,"rank":32568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":154649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187314,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1617,"mean":5.2802042079208,"rank":248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":1369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1617,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":2.9160215053763,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
