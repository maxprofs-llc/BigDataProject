It has been demonstrated that CYN is a potent protein and glutathione synthesis inhibitor, and induces genotoxicity and oxidative stress. The present study investigated the protective role of two different doses of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) (22 and 45 mg\/fish\/day) against the pathological changes induced in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) orally exposed to a single dose of pure CYN or CYN from an Aphanizomenon ovalisporum CYN-producer strain (200\u00a0\u03bcg\/kg of CYN in both cases). Moreover, an immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was carried out in order to elucidate the CYN distribution in exposed fish. The histological findings were more pronounced when fish were intoxicated with CYN from the cyanobacterial strain, being liver and kidney the main targets for CYN toxicity. NAC pre-treatment was effective reducing the damage induced by CYN, especially at the highest dose employed (45 mg\/fish\/day), with a total prevention in all organs. The IHC analysis showed that CYN-antigen appeared mainly in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, although it was also present in kidney and gills. In this case, the immunopositive results were more abundant in those fish exposed to pure CYN. NAC reduced the number of immunopositive cases in a dose-dependent way. Therefore, NAC can be considered a useful chemoprotectant in the prophylaxis and treatment of CYN-related intoxications in fish.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000367e","authors":["Guti\u00e9rrez-Praena D","Risalde MA","Pichardo S","Jos A","Moyano R","Blanco A","Vasconcelos V","Came\u00e1n AM"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.toxicon.2013.11.014","first_seen_on":"2014-01-07T09:24:52+00:00","issns":["00410101"],"journal":"Toxicon","last_mentioned_on":1430336228,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0041010113004467","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24291634?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24291634","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) exposed to cylindrospermopsin and the effectiveness of N-Acetylcysteine to prevent its toxic effects ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/histopathological-immunohistochemical-analysis-tilapia-oreochromis-niloticus-exposed-cylindrospermop"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038209,"mean":5.9746183047646,"rank":2227571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2755061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038209,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135124,"mean":7.7843098806275,"rank":51452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":81944,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135124,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":980,"mean":3.1343125638407,"rank":648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":980,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.49475,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
