It affects approximately 1% of adults in developed countries. Periodontitis is a chronic oral infection, caused by inflammatory reactions to gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, and affecting about 35 to 50% of adults. If left untreated, periodontitis can lead to tooth loss. A significant association has been shown to exist between periodontitis and RA in observational studies. Some intervention studies have suggested that periodontal treatment can reduce serum inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, or erythrocyte sedimentation rate. We hypothesize that periodontitis could be an aggravating factor in patients with RA, and that its treatment would improve RA outcomes. The aim of this clinical trial is to assess the effect of periodontal treatment on the biological and clinical parameters of patients with RA.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008a6","doi":"10.1186\/1745-6215-14-253","first_seen_on":"2014-01-04T17:31:56+00:00","issns":["1745-6215"],"issue":"1","journal":"Trials","last_mentioned_on":1392708009,"links":["http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/pdf\/1745-6215-14-253.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/pdf\/1745-6215-14-253.pdf","pmid":"23945051","pubdate":"2013-08-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Statistics for Life Sciences, Medicine, Health Sciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"253","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Effect of periodontal treatment on the clinical parameters of patients with rheumatoid arthritis: study protocol of the randomized, controlled ESPERA trial","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-periodontal-treatment-clinical-parameters-patients-rheumatoid-arthritis-study-protocol-random-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":1689190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":2793862,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122472,"mean":7.6897529211,"rank":37507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":83964,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122472,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1428,"mean":4.135456201822,"rank":555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1428,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":4.6572183908046,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
