Clearly, activation of these mechanisms must precede skeletal muscle growth. Most mechanistic studies of RE have involved analysis of outcome variables after many training sessions. This study measured molecular level responses to RE on a scale of hours to establish a time course for the activation of myogenic mechanisms. Muscle biopsy samples were collected from nine subjects before and after acute bouts of RE. The response to a single bout was assessed at 12 and 24 h postexercise. Further samples were obtained 24 and 72 h after a second exercise bout. RE was induced by neuromuscular electrical stimulation to generate maximal isometric contractions in the muscle of interest. A single RE bout resulted in increased levels of mRNA for IGF binding protein-4 (84%), MyoD (83%), myogenin (approximately 3-fold), cyclin D1 (50%), and p21-Waf1 (16-fold), and a transient decrease in IGF-I mRNA (46%). A temporally conserved, significant correlation between myogenin and p21 mRNA was observed (r = 0.70, P < or = 0.02). The mRNAs for mechano-growth factor, IGF binding protein-5, and the IGF-I receptor were unchanged by RE. Total skeletal muscle RNA was increased 72 h after the second serial bout of RE. These results indicate that molecular adaptations of skeletal muscle to loading respond in a very short time. This approach should provide insights on the mechanisms that modulate adaptation to RE and may be useful in evaluating RE training protocol variables with high temporal resolution.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b71","authors":["C.
