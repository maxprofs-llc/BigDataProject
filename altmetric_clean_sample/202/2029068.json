One group included 20 pre-eclamptic pregnant women with gestational age 20-35 weeks of pregnancy and the same in the control group that included; however, 20 normotensive pregnant women. Histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy techniques were used. Histopathological examination of syncytial nodes and stromal cells were observed in the increase in hyperplasia and hyalinization. The evaluation immunohistochemical of chorionic villi, placenta, and hematopoietic stem cell markers showed a positive reaction with CD34. Ultrastructural examination showed endoplasmic reticulum dilatation, degeneration of mitochondria in endothelial cells, and capillary vessel edema.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9173cf058f61000d081","authors":["S Kalkanli","E Deveci","M E Sak","M S Evsen","O Baran","S Ozekinci","D Yavuz"],"first_seen_on":"2014-01-08T14:51:47+00:00","issns":["0390-6663"],"issue":"3","journal":"Clinical and experimental obstetrics gynecology","last_mentioned_on":1389192701,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24283180"],"pmid":"24283180","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"CD34 expression of chorionic villous in pre-eclamptic placenta: an immunohistochemical and ultrastructural study.","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cd34-expression-chorionic-villous-preeclamptic-placenta-immunohistochemical-ultrastructural-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3563990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137739,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122891,"mean":7.6223853690295,"rank":95465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122891,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":1.2309931972789,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.99444444444444,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
