DNA sequencing revealed that mutations in BAP1 (BRCA1 associated protein-1) occur in 5% to 15% of ccRCC cases and are associated with poor outcomes. The vast majority of BAP1 mutations abolish protein expression. In this study, we used a highly sensitive and specific immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay to test whether BAP1 expression is an independent marker of ccRCC-specific survival, particularly in patients with low-risk disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002494","authors":["Joseph RW","Kapur P","Serie DJ","Eckel-Passow JE","Parasramka M","Ho T","Cheville JC","Frenkel E","Rakheja D","Brugarolas J","Parker A","Joseph, Richard W.","Kapur, Payal","Serie, Daniel J.","Eckel\u2010Passow, Jeanette E.","Parasramka, Mansi","Ho, Thai","Cheville, John C.","Frenkel, Eugene","Rakheja, Dinesh","Brugarolas, James","Parker, Alexander"],"doi":"10.1002\/cncr.28521","endpage":"1067","first_seen_on":"2014-01-07T21:52:59+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1097-0142","0008-543X"],"issue":"7","journal":"Cancer (0008543X)","last_mentioned_on":1389263482,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cncr.28521\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cncr.28521\/abstract?7089573=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cncr.28521\/pdf","pmid":"24382589","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1059","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Loss of BAP1 protein expression is an independent marker of poor prognosis in patients with low\u2010risk clear cell renal cell carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"120","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/loss-bap1-protein-expression-independent-marker-poor-prognosis-patients-lowrisk-clear-cell-renal-cel-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6582076,"mean":6.1066245252449,"rank":398611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":6182563,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6582076,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154729,"mean":7.641562457991,"rank":12415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":142283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154729,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3892,"mean":12.110946800308,"rank":514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3892,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":24.037233333333,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
