Of the organs studied, significantly (P < 0.1) higher concentrations of lipid peroxides were observed only in the liver and kidney of the experimental rats. In the course of the feeding, the experimental rats showed significantly (P < 0.1) lower gains in body weights as well as higher relative liver weights than the control rats.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f2","authors":["Nwanguma, B C","Achebe, A C","Ezeanyika, L U","Eze, L C"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0278-6915(99)00023-x","first_seen_on":"2014-01-05T10:27:47+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["02786915","0278-6915"],"issue":"4","journal":"Food & Chemical Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1388917616,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S027869159900023X"],"pmid":"10418956","pubdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Toxicity of oxidized fats II: tissue levels of lipid peroxides in rats fed a thermally oxidized corn oil diet","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/toxicity-oxidized-fats-ii-tissue-levels-lipid-peroxides-rats-fed-thermally-oxidized-corn-oil-diet"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627916,"mean":4.9454584244709,"rank":2905304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627916,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111100,"mean":7.2258644092208,"rank":86883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111100,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1114,"mean":6.7928104222821,"rank":832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1114,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":3.80095,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
