None of the patients exhibited any complications associated with stenting, and the median post-stenting fasting period was 3 days(range, 1-7 days). Oral intake improved significantly in all the patients; in patients with nasogastric tubes, the tubes were removed after stenting. However, in patients with peritoneal dissemination, oral intake alone was not sufficient, and additional parenteral nutrition was required. In conclusion, gastroduodenal stenting is believed to be useful for palliative care in gastric cancer patients with pyloric stenosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9263cf058f61000dcf4","authors":["Ryohei Kawabata","Yutaka Kimura","Tomono Kawase","Shinji Kitamura","Takamasa Yabuta","Yuki Tsukamoto","Daichi Mitsudo","Aya Gohara","Mutsumi Fukunaga","Hiroki Ohzato"],"first_seen_on":"2014-01-08T11:12:54+00:00","issns":["0385-0684"],"issue":"12","journal":"Gan to kagaku ryoho Cancer chemotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1389179544,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24393888?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24393888","pubdate":"2013-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","antineoplasticagents"],"title":"[Gastroduodenal stent placement in gastric cancer patients with pyloric stenosis].","type":"article","volume":"40"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628302,"mean":4.942517914036,"rank":2904020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628302,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111255,"mean":7.1286762183834,"rank":86964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111255,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":385,"mean":0.59405208333333,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":385,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.27777777777778,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/libroazuln\/status\/420875629773328384","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2028522],"posted_on":"2014-01-08T11:12:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":161},"tweet_id":"420875629773328384"}]}}
