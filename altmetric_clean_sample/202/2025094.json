Methods: The study included 126 women who were in the third trimester pregnancy. All subjects completed a standard sleep questionnaire, anthropometric measurements and ultrasonic testing. Results: Pregnant women with NC \u226534.7\u2009cm had significantly higher frequency of PIH than pregnant women with NC <34.7\u2009cm (35.6% versus 2.5%, \u03c7(2\u2009)=\u200925.863, p\u2009=\u20090.000). Conclusions: The increase of NC was independent risk factor for PIH in the third trimester pregnant women.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5263cf058f610003d53","authors":["Jun-Tao Shao","Jie Yu","Jun-Qiao Qi","Xiao-Dong Liu"],"doi":"10.3109\/10641955.2013.874441","endpage":"8","first_seen_on":"2014-01-07T04:45:13+00:00","issns":["1064-1955","1525-6065"],"journal":"Hypertension in Pregnancy","last_mentioned_on":1397405643,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/10641955.2013.874441","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/10641955.2013.874441?ai=1lne&mi=3gfofr&af=R&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed&"],"pmid":"24392861","pubdate":"2014-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["obstetrics"],"title":"The relationship between neck circumference and pregnancy-induced hypertension in the third trimester pregnant women.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-between-neck-circumference-pregnancyinduced-hypertension-third-trimester-pregnant-women"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":1847252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3164457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134693,"mean":7.8167850948834,"rank":39172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":94681,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134693,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":0.95384615384615,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.81111111111111,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
