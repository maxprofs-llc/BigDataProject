In terms of EUS-guided extrahepatic bile duct drainage, recently, EUS-guided choledochoantrostomy has been reported as a variation of EUS-BD. We describe a case of successful choledochoantrostomy using a fully covered self-expandable metallic stent. We conclude that EUS-guided choledochoantrostomy should be one option for biliary decompression. In particular, if patients have duodenal strictures, with or without a duodenal metal stent, it seems to be an ideal alternative to choledochoduodenostomy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000270a","authors":["Takao Itoi","Fumihide Itokawa","Takayoshi Tsuchiya","Shujiro Tsuji","Ryosuke Tonozuka"],"doi":"10.1111\/den.12065","first_seen_on":"2014-01-08T11:22:39+00:00","issns":["1443-1661"],"journal":"Digestive Endoscopy","last_mentioned_on":1389180125,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23617666?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23617666","pubdate":"2013-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","diagnosticimaging","gastroenterology"],"title":"Endoscopic ultrasound-guided choledochoantrostomy as an alternative extrahepatic bile duct drainage method in pancreatic cancer with duodenal invasion.","type":"article","volume":"25 Suppl 2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endoscopic-ultrasoundguided-choledochoantrostomy-alternative-extrahepatic-bile-duct-drainage-method"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635050,"mean":4.9227315329755,"rank":2900897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635050,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111687,"mean":7.1221443869422,"rank":87105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111687,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131,"mean":0.76115384615385,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.58333333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
