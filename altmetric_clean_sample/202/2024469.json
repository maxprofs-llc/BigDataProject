The extracted ions could be quantitatively back extracted using 0.5 M HNO3. This amide shows negligible extraction towards Sr(II) and Ru(III) ions, making it advantageous over other reported extractants. The structures of Sm(III) and Eu(III) nitrate compounds show that the metal ion is surrounded by three of the ligands, one nitrate and one water molecule. The ligand acts as a neutral bidentate ligand and bonds through the amido and hydroxyl oxygen atoms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Shanmugaperumal Kannan","Bal Govind Vats","I.
