Eighty patients were recruited from a specialized outpatient clinic. Knowledge was assessed with the modified Knowledge About Schizophrenia Test (KAST). Medication adherence was determined with the Chinese abridged Medication Adherence Ratings Scale. Insight was measured with the abridged Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder (SUMD). The KAST total score was correlated with the SUMD. A trend correlation between KAST subscores of cause and SUMD was found. The nonadherence rate was 43.8%. The medication-adherent patients had lower SUMD (z = -4.338, p < 0.0001) and higher KAST subscore of cause (z = -2.767, p = 0.006). These two variables explained 38.9% of the variance in adherence behavior, with SUMD being the mediator. This study highlights the importance of patients' understanding of etiology of the illness and its relationship with insight and medication adherence.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e6f","authors":["Chan KW","Hui LM","Wong HY","Lee HM","Chang WC","Chen YH"],"doi":"10.1097\/nmd.0000000000000068","first_seen_on":"2014-01-07T15:58:15+00:00","issns":["0022-3018"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease","last_mentioned_on":1429314073,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jonmd\/Abstract\/2014\/01000\/Medication_Adherence,_Knowledge_About_Psychosis,.6.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24375208","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24375208\/","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jonmd\/Fulltext\/2014\/01000\/Medication_Adherence,_Knowledge_About_Psychosis,.6.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jonmd\/2014\/01000\/Medication_Adherence,_Knowledge_About_Psychosis,.6.pdf","pmid":"24375208","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"25","subjects":["psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"Medication Adherence, Knowledge About Psychosis, and Insight Among Patients With a Schizophrenia-Spectrum Disorder","type":"article","volume":"202","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/medication-adherence-knowledge-about-psychosis-insight-among-patients-schizophreniaspectrum-disorder"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6368129,"mean":5.8428969537054,"rank":1175733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5186736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6368129,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145931,"mean":7.8211385869939,"rank":32182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":113547,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145931,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1509,"mean":3.6275676392573,"rank":205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":1303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1509,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":2.40724,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
