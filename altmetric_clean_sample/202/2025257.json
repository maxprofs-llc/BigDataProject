Two related arguments are considered. The first suggests that standard accounts of evidence-based practice imply an overly narrow view of 'evidence', and that a more inclusive concept, incorporating 'patterns of knowing' not recognised by the familiar evidence hierarchies, should be adopted. The second suggests that statistical generalisations cannot be applied non-problematically to individual patients in specific contexts, and points out that this is why we need clinical judgement. In evaluating the first argument, I propose a criterion for what counts as evidence. It is a minimalist criterion but the 'patterns of knowing', referred to in the literature, still fail to meet it. In evaluating the second argument, I will outline the powerful empirical reasons we have for thinking that decisions based on research evidence are usually better than decisions based on clinical judgement; and show that current efforts to rehabilitate clinical judgement seriously underestimate the strength of these reasons. By way of conclusion, I will sketch the ways in which the concept of expertise will have to be modified if we accept evidence-based practice as a template for health-care.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5103cf058f61000320c","authors":["Paley, John"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1440-1800.2006.00307.x","endpage":"93","first_seen_on":"2014-01-07T07:23:30+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1440-1800","1320-7881"],"issue":"2","journal":"Nursing Inquiry","last_mentioned_on":1390687159,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1440-1800.2006.00307.x\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1440-1800.2006.00307.x\/pdf","pmid":"16700751","pubdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"82","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Evidence and expertise","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidence-expertise"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6333733,"mean":5.9768338590895,"rank":4680863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":943026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6333733,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151602,"mean":7.6405560649338,"rank":100944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":27830,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151602,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":217,"mean":3.5701574074074,"rank":166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":217,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":5.76,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
