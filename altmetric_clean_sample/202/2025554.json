However, its measurement is currently restricted to research settings, owing to a moderate level of operator dependency. We tested a new noninvasive device in a large UK cohort. The device estimates central BP using measurements obtained with an upper arm cuff inflated to suprasystolic pressure. We compared these estimates with those obtained using radial tonometry as well as with invasively acquired measurements of aortic BP in a limited number of individuals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a49","doi":"10.1097\/hjh.0000000000000082","first_seen_on":"2014-01-07T10:14:45+00:00","funders":["wellcome","bhf"],"issns":["0263-6352"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Hypertension","last_mentioned_on":1395176328,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jhypertension\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Arterial_pressure___agreement_between_a_brachial.98646.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jhypertension\/Fulltext\/2014\/04000\/Arterial_pressure__agreement_between_a_brachial.23.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jhypertension\/9000\/00000\/Arterial_pressure___agreement_between_a_brachial.98646.pdf","pmid":"24379000","pubdate":"2014-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","title":"Arterial pressure: agreement between a brachial cuff-based device and radial tonometry","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/arterial-pressure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3066445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":944667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122658,"mean":7.6156029904533,"rank":80941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":27490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122658,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1756,"mean":1.9787031339031,"rank":908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1756,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":3.4130869565217,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Mathematics":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JHypertension\/status\/420498679431057408","license":"public","citation_ids":[2025554],"posted_on":"2014-01-07T10:14:32+00:00","author":{"name":"J Hypertension","url":"http:\/\/www.jhypertension.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1694937141\/HJH_cover_square_normal.jpg","description":"The Journal contains primary papers from world-renowned experts and authoritative reviews that summarize and evaluate the most significant recent developments.","id_on_source":"JHypertension","tweeter_id":"437628033","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1008},"tweet_id":"420498679431057408"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JHypertension\/status\/446027964103135232","license":"public","citation_ids":[2025554],"posted_on":"2014-03-18T20:58:48+00:00","author":{"name":"J Hypertension","url":"http:\/\/www.jhypertension.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1694937141\/HJH_cover_square_normal.jpg","description":"The Journal contains primary papers from world-renowned experts and authoritative reviews that summarize and evaluate the most significant recent developments.","id_on_source":"JHypertension","tweeter_id":"437628033","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1008},"tweet_id":"446027964103135232"}]}}
