It is important source of vitamin C, potassium, folic acid, and carotenoids, such as lycopene. Carotenoids are the pigments synthesized during fruit ripening and responsible for the final red color of the tomato. Consumption of tomato and tomato-based products contribute to the absorption of carotenoids and lycopenes in human serum. Lycopene is chemically acyclic carotene with 11 conjugated double bonds, normally in transconfiguration while isomerization occur in blood plasma for its better absorption. It has ability for adenosine deaminase inhibition that plays important role in the regression of tumor. Tomato also contain other active compounds, namely, neoxanthin, lutein, \u03b1-cryptoxanthin, \u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene, cyclolycopene, and \u03b2-carotene 5, 6-epoxide. These components provide synergistic effect against various threats but still need further attention of the researchers. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have elucidated the potential of tomato against variety of metabolic syndromes. Latest research highlights the relationship between consuming tomato and its products with reduced risk of various maladies like obesity, hyperglycemic and hypercholesterolemic attributes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer insurgences. Moreover, tomato and its bioactive components hold potential to become effective modules in diet-based regimens; however, integrated research and meta-analysis are still required to enhance meticulousness.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d63cf058f6100010a4","authors":["Rashida Perveen","Hafiz Ansar Rasul Suleria","Faqir Muhammad Anjum","Masood Sadiq Butt","Imran Pasha","Sarfraz Ahmad","Perveen R","Suleria HA","Anjum FM","Butt MS","Pasha I","Ahmad S"],"doi":"10.1080\/10408398.2012.657809","first_seen_on":"2014-01-06T11:25:08+00:00","issns":["1040-8398","1549-7852"],"issue":"7","journal":"Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1497974425,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10408398.2012.657809","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10408398.2012.657809#.VMz59dLLfP8","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24915375"],"pmid":"24915375","pubdate":"2013-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Engineering","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"130824120001000","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) carotenoids &amp; lycopenes chemistry; Metabolism, absorption, nutrition and allied health claims- A comprehensive review.","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tomato-solanum-lycopersicum-carotenoids-lycopenes-chemistry-metabolism-absorption-nutrition-allied-h"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.25,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":841135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7548178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187057,"mean":7.3104078243951,"rank":20503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":166395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187057,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":819,"mean":10.82330806846,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":819,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":8.00465,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
