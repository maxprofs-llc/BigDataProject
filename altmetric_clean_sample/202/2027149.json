This paper sets out the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) guidelines for the safety monitoring of widely used agents in the treatment of bipolar disorder. These guidelines aim to provide recommendations that take into consideration the balance between safety and cost-effectiveness, to highlight iatrogenic and preventive clinical issues, and to facilitate the broad implementation of therapeutic safety monitoring as a standard component of treatment for bipolar disorder.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023fd","authors":["Ng F","Mammen OK","Wilting I","Sachs GS","Ferrier IN","Cassidy F","Beaulieu S","Yatham LN","Berk M","Ng, Felicity","Mammen, Oommen K","Wilting, Ingeborg","Sachs, Gary S","Ferrier, I Nicol","Cassidy, Frederick","Beaulieu, Serge","Yatham, Lakshmi N","Berk, Michael","Felicity Ng","Oommen K Mammen","Ingeborg Wilting","Gary S Sachs","I Nicol Ferrier","Frederick Cassidy","Serge Beaulieu","Lakshmi N Yatham","Michael Berk"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1399-5618.2009.00737.x","endpage":"595","first_seen_on":"2014-01-07T21:47:48+00:00","handle":"2440\/54802","handles":["2440\/54802"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1399-5618","1398-5647","13985647","13995618"],"issue":"6","journal":"Bipolar Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1389131241,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1399-5618.2009.00737.x\/full","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1399-5618.2009.00737.x","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19689501","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1399-5618.2009.00737.x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1399-5618.2009.00737.x\/pdf","pmid":"19689501","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"559","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"The International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) consensus guidelines for the safety monitoring of bipolar disorder treatments.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1399-5618.2009.00737.x","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/international-society-bipolar-disorders-isbd-consensus-guidelines-safety-monitoring-bipolar-disorder"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7645393,"mean":6.573102623118,"rank":1718379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5893213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7645393,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182433,"mean":7.08051613752,"rank":42004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":139502,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182433,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":579,"mean":4.9417993079585,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":579,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":6.75,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Ph.
