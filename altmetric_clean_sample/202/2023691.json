The small size of endoscopic biopsies and the increasing number of relevant but uncommon markers has increased the need for rational approaches to molecular testing. We present the results of clinical preselection before EML4-ALK testing in a German NSCLC cohort.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007efc","doi":"10.1097\/jto.0000000000000043","first_seen_on":"2014-01-06T18:21:26+00:00","issns":["1556-0864"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Thoracic Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1390135536,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jto\/Abstract\/2014\/01000\/Preselection_Based_on_Clinical_Characteristics_in.15.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jto\/2014\/01000\/Preselection_Based_on_Clinical_Characteristics_in.15.pdf","pmid":"24346098","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"109","subjects":["neoplasms","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Preselection Based on Clinical Characteristics in German Non\u2013Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients Screened for EML4-ALK Translocation","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preselection-based-clinical-characteristics-german-nonsmallcell-lung-cancer-patients-screened-eml4al"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4771252,"mean":5.7193043556114,"rank":3380634,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":775945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4771252,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128209,"mean":7.8756157962063,"rank":85531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":23906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128209,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1700,"mean":3.2931877575044,"rank":975,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1700,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":5.950925,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
