The present experimental study examined the processing of emotional information in BD patients using the eye-tracking technology. Bipolar patients in their different states (euthymia, mania, depression) simultaneously viewed four pictures with different emotional valence (happy, neutral, sad, threatening) for 20s while their eye movements were monitored. A group of healthy individuals served as the control. The data revealed the following: (i) a decrease in attention to happy images in BD patients in their depressive episodes compared to healthy individuals, and (ii) an increase in attention to threatening images in BD patients (regardless of their episode) relative to the healthy controls. These biases appeared in the late stages of information processing and were sustained over the 20s interval. Thus, the present findings reveal that attentional biases toward emotional information can be a key feature of BD, in that: (i) an anhedonic lack of sensitivity to positive stimuli during the bipolar depressive episode may be considered a maintaining factor of this clinical state, and (ii) the trait-bias toward threat, even in asymptomatic patients, may reflect a marker of vulnerability in BD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d2","authors":["Garc\u00eda-Blanco A","Salmer\u00f3n L","Perea M","Livianos L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.psychres.2013.12.039","endpage":"633","first_seen_on":"2014-01-08T20:24:29+00:00","issns":["01651781","0165-1781"],"issue":"3","journal":"Psychiatry Research","last_mentioned_on":1483053430,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0165178113008330","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24439518?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.psy-journal.com\/article\/S0165-1781(13)00833-0\/abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24439518"],"pmid":"24439518","pubdate":"2014-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"628","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Attentional biases toward emotional images in the different episodes of bipolar disorder: An eye-tracking study","type":"article","volume":"215","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/attentional-biases-toward-emotional-images-different-episodes-bipolar-disorder-eyetracking-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7953275,"mean":6.7183323059095,"rank":672693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7278782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7953275,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184476,"mean":7.1424116655376,"rank":17500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":166929,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184476,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3707,"mean":4.5924862385321,"rank":239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":3468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3707,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":8.1756590909091,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
