Two cases of RA with active TB were followed up to 3 years following the initiation of Rtx. The former case presented with a history of concomitant diagnosis of both RA and TB and the latest one, also diagnosed with RA and reactivation of TB developed during the anti-tumour necrosis factor treatment. After a sufficient time of follow-up, we have observed that Rtx seems to be safer and efficient in the treatment of active RA and TB.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc98","authors":["Yavuz Pehlivan","Bunyamin Kisacik","Vuslat Kecik Bosnak","Ahmet Mesut Onat"],"doi":"10.1136\/bcr-2012-006585","first_seen_on":"2014-01-08T16:25:01+00:00","issns":["1757-790X"],"journal":"BMJ Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1389197004,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23341582?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23341582","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Rituximab seems to be a safer alternative in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis with tuberculosis.","type":"article","volume":"2013","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rituximab-seems-safer-alternative-patients-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-tuberculosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":4201072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134972,"mean":7.8206958235476,"rank":109717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134972,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2406,"mean":3.412483991684,"rank":1823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2406,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176,"mean":1.5050285714286,"rank":117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/emiliomonteb\/status\/420948861570785280","license":"public","citation_ids":[2029282],"posted_on":"2014-01-08T16:03:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Emilio Monte","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/emilio-monte-boquet-67032624\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/898548741422153728\/en1Mia9R_normal.jpg","description":"#Farmacia #HospitalLaFe #HospitalPharmacy PharmD PhD #eSalud #eHealth #Sherpas20 @ufpelafe @eDruida_","id_on_source":"emiliomonteb","tweeter_id":"51391835","geo":{"lt":39.5,"ln":-0.75,"country":"ES"},"followers":3631},"tweet_id":"420948861570785280"}]}}
