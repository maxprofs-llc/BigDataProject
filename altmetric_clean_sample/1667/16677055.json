The pattern suggests that shear stress on the fault increases slowly with depth and reaches a value on the order of the average stress released during earthquakes. This result has important implications for both long- and shortterm prediction of large earthquakes.","ads_id":"1979Sci...206..445Z","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["MARK D.
