Their gel-like nature was revealed by the Tyndall and coagulation effect which was elucidated by their negative Zeta potential value. The influence of temperatures on the properties and sizes of these G-CDs was analyzed and the best method for maximum quantum yield (QY) was identified. The resulting products emitted blue photoluminescence (PL) under UV light (365 nm) and a gradient of color in the regular light. In addition, UV-Vis absorption and excitation-dependent fluorescence spectra of G-CDs indicated those synthesized at 160 \u2103 exhibited the highest fluorescence quantum yield (33%). AFM and TEM measurements were performed and higher temperature of formation resulted in smaller G-CDs. Furthermore, peak shifts in the UV-Vis and fluorescence spectra, and sequential change of quantum yield values, Zeta potential and XPS elemental compositional changes synchronously effectively monitored throughout G-CDs formation process. As to application, G-CDs were prepared as invisible ink for printer, which exhibited applicability of G-CDs in daily life or military activities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dda","authors":["Zhou, Yiqun","Desserre, Alexandra","Sharma, Shiv K.","Li, Shanghao","Marksberry, M.
