Thus, platforms like resonant cavities and photonic crystals that enable the inhibition and manipulation of vacuum fluctuations have been key to our ability to control light-matter interactions (e.g., the decay of quantum emitters). Here, we theoretically demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations may be naturally inhibited within bodies immersed in epsilon-and-mu-near-zero (EMNZ) media, while they can also be selectively excited via bound eigenmodes. Therefore, zero-index structures are proposed as an alternative platform to manipulate the decay of quantum emitters, possibly leading to the exploration of qualitatively different dynamics. For example, a direct modulation of the vacuum Rabi frequency is obtained by deforming the EMNZ region without detuning a bound eigenmode. Ideas for the possible implementation of these concepts using synthetic implementations based on structural dispersion are also proposed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["I\u00f1igo Liberal","Nader Engheta"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1611924114","first_seen_on":"2017-02-23T08:02:45+00:00","issns":["0027-8424","1091-6490"],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1487820422,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.1611924114"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/114\/5\/822.full.pdf","pmid":"28096367","pubdate":"2017-01-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Zero-index structures as an alternative platform for quantum optics","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/lookup\/doi\/10.1073\/pnas.1611924114","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zeroindex-structures-alternative-platform-quantum-optics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8261086,"mean":6.9752528681095,"rank":7144844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8261086,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242905,"mean":13.702658169482,"rank":202502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242905,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46422,"mean":24.022847892118,"rank":44347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46422,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1076,"mean":51.089291162791,"rank":1002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1076,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
