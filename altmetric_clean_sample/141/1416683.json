This so-called Random Regret Minimization (RRM) approach forms an alternative to the dominant Random Utility Maximization (RUM) approach. The RRM approach is able to model semi-compensatory choice behaviour and compromise effects, while being as parsimonious and formally tractable as the RUM approach.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032dc","doi":"10.1007\/s40273-013-0059-0","first_seen_on":"2013-04-27T10:19:22+00:00","issns":["1179-2027"],"journal":"PharmacoEconomics","last_mentioned_on":1372192098,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23620214?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23620214","pubdate":"2013-04-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Health Administration","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Economics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacoeconomics and Health Outcomes","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Quality of Life Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Economics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Random Regret-Based Discrete-Choice Modelling: An Application to Healthcare.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/random-regretbased-discretechoice-modelling-application-healthcare"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228985,"mean":5.9651782765876,"rank":4381076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1622646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228985,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97352,"mean":7.1956676767573,"rank":61124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":31881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97352,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":690,"mean":3.2276545718433,"rank":426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":690,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.4930555555556,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
