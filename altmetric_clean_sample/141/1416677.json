However, there has not been a study that has directly assessed changes in mitochondrial oxidative capacity or metabolic control as a consequence of such training in vivo. Therefore, we used (31) P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31) P-MRS) to examine the effect of short-term plantar flexion exercise training on phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery kinetics and the control of respiration rate.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002161","authors":["Layec G","Haseler LJ","Hoff J","Hart CR","Liu X","Le Fur Y","Jeong EK","Richardson RS","Layec, G.","Haseler, L.
