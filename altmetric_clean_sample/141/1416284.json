Although isolated ocular complaints are rarely life-threatening, they can lead to significant short- and long-term morbidity, including permanent visual loss. The role of the emergency physician in management of ocular emergencies is similar to that for other chief complaints: to recognize and diagnose emergency conditions, to provide appropriate initial therapy, and to ensure correct disposition. This article reviews several of the essential ophthalmologic procedures that are within the scope of emergency medical practice. Slit lamp examination, foreign body removal, use of ultrasound, tonometry, and other emergency ophthalmologic procedures are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f610007268","authors":["Babineau MR","Sanchez LD"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.emc.2007.11.003","first_seen_on":"2013-04-27T02:24:01+00:00","issns":["0733-8627"],"issue":"1","journal":"Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America","last_mentioned_on":1327166142,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18249255"],"pmid":"18249255","pubdate":"2008-02-07T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Ophthalmologic procedures in the emergency department.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ophthalmologic-procedures-emergency-department"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633255,"mean":4.9221505741186,"rank":2897872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81970,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633255,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84213,"mean":6.7373620149149,"rank":65278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84213,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191,"mean":3.1038631578947,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
