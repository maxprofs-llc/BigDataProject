This report presents the case of a 56-year-old Japanese male that showed an abnormal laboratory profile 18 months after resection of a skin melanoma occurring on the left fifth finger. The cytology of bile obtained by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography yielded a diagnosis of melanoma with metastasis to the common bile duct. Surgery revealed melanoma within the distal common bile duct. There were no other secondary metastases in the abdomen and a radical pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. The patient survived for 13 months without any signs of recurrence and died of progressive systemic metastatic melanoma 34 months after surgery. Therefore, radical surgical resection appears to be effective for the prolongation of survival in cases of melanoma with metastasis to the common bile duct.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037d2","authors":["Wakasugi M","Tori M","Akamatsu H","Yoshidome K","Ueshima S","Omori T","Tei M","Masuzawa T","Iwamoto T","Nishida T"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00595-012-0205-x","first_seen_on":"2013-04-27T10:17:07+00:00","issns":["0941-1291"],"issue":"","journal":"Surgery Today","last_mentioned_on":1367057706,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22674289?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22674289","pubdate":"2012-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Abdominal Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiac Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgical Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Thoracic Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Vascular Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Pancreatoduodenectomy for melanoma with metastasis to the common bile duct.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pancreatoduodenectomy-melanoma-metastasis-common-bile-duct"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632901,"mean":4.9227823810231,"rank":2897992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632901,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84208,"mean":6.7380033963924,"rank":65280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84208,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301,"mean":1.2636333333333,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.4634615384615,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/328089916267454464","license":"public","citation_ids":[1416666],"posted_on":"2013-04-27T10:15:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"328089916267454464"}]}}
