We hypothesized that IL-15, a pro-inflammatory cytokine expressed in colitis and an osteoclastogenic factor, could play a central role in systemic and skeletal complications of inflammatory bowel diseases. We evaluated the effects of an IL-15 antagonist, CRB-15, in mice with chronic colitis induced by oral 2% dextran sulfate sodium for 1 week, followed by another 1% for 2 weeks. During the last 2 weeks, mice were treated daily with CRB-15 or an IgG2a control antibody. Intestinal inflammation, disease severity, and bone parameters were evaluated at days 14 and 21. CRB-15 improved survival, early weight loss, and colitis clinical score, although colon damage and inflammation were prevented in only half the survivors. CRB-15 also delayed loss of femur bone mineral density and trabecular microarchitecture. Bone loss was characterized by decreased bone formation, but increased bone marrow osteoclast progenitors and osteoclast numbers on bone surfaces. CRB-15 prevented the suppression of osteoblastic markers of bone formation, and reduced osteoclast progenitors at day 14, but not later. However, by day 21, CRB-15 decreased tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and increased IL-10 expression in bone, paralleling a reduction of osteoclasts. These results delineate the role of IL-15 on the systemic and skeletal manifestations of chronic colitis and provide a proof-of-concept for future therapeutic developments.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006988","authors":["Royer BB","Pierroz DD","Velin D","Frossard C","Xiao Zheng X","Lehr HA","Ferrari-Lacraz S","Ferrari SL"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajpath.2013.02.033","first_seen_on":"2013-04-25T11:31:52+00:00","issns":["0002-9440"],"issue":"","journal":"American Journal of Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1372098455,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23583421\/"],"pmid":"23583421","pubdate":"2013-04-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Investigative Pathology","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Effects of an Interleukin-15 Antagonist on Systemic and Skeletal Alterations in Mice with DSS-Induced Colitis.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-interleukin15-antagonist-systemic-skeletal-alterations-mice-dssinduced-colitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4715210,"mean":5.6976580270372,"rank":2297267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2371430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4715210,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90245,"mean":7.1521091706929,"rank":40337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":48729,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90245,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1564,"mean":3.8376967370441,"rank":728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1564,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":8.7418787878788,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
