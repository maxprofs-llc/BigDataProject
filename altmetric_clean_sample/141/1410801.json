No CNV was found in PARK7, ATP13A2, PINK1, and LRRK2. Intronic-only CNVs were found in SNCA and PARK2 but were not associated with PD risk. A whole-gene duplication of SNCA was found in one case. The allele frequency of PARK2 exonic CNV is significantly higher in cases than in controls (P = 0.02), higher in early-onset (AAO \u2264 40) than in late-onset cases (P = 0.001), and higher in familial than in sporadic cases (P = 0.005). Except for single exon 2 duplications, all PARK2 exonic CNVs have different breakpoints, even when the same exon(s) were involved. In conclusion, except for SNCA and PARK2, CNVs are not a major contributing mechanism for the familial PD genes examined. The majority of PARK2 exonic CNVs are not recurrent.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f61000767d","authors":["Wang, Liyong","Nuytemans, Karen","Bademci, Guney","Jauregui, Cherylyn","Martin, Eden R.","Scott, William K.","Vance, Jeffery M.","Zuchner, Stephan"],"doi":"10.1002\/humu.22344","endpage":"1074","first_seen_on":"2013-04-25T02:31:20+00:00","issns":["1098-1004","1059-7794"],"issue":"8","journal":"Human Mutation","last_mentioned_on":1367155961,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/humu.22344\/abstract;jsessionid=F190560FACB49DDC9F54EFDE65BBB940.d03t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/humu.22344\/abstract;jsessionid=0D9B1012D7B57AC44FA8D46C140D7842.d03t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/humu.22344\/pdf","pmid":"23616242","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1071","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"High\u00e2\u0080\u0090Resolution Survey in Familial Parkinson Disease Genes Reveals Multiple Independent Copy Number Variation Events in PARK2","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highresolution-survey-familial-parkinson-disease-genes-reveals-multiple-independent-copy-number-vari"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6329178,"mean":5.9771205286249,"rank":2977057,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1893387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6329178,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98652,"mean":7.1625280838512,"rank":48720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":37057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98652,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1169,"mean":3.1362859589041,"rank":805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1169,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.5833333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
