This proposal seems too obvious to need saying, but published estimates of the LULCC flux are widely variable for reasons that have more to do with modeling environmental effects than with LULCC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002974","authors":["Houghton, Richard A."],"doi":"10.1111\/gcb.12233","endpage":"2612","first_seen_on":"2013-04-26T16:18:31+00:00","issns":["1365-2486","1354-1013"],"issue":"9","journal":"Global Change Biology","last_mentioned_on":1366992986,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gcb.12233\/abstract;jsessionid=7F729325CDE4711F8FD6592764AB2D7B.d04t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gcb.12233\/pdf","pmid":"23625734","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2609","title":"Keeping management effects separate from environmental effects in terrestrial carbon accounting","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/keeping-management-effects-separate-environmental-effects-terrestrial-carbon-accounting"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":4203184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92838,"mean":7.1120013356745,"rank":76118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92838,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1802,"mean":13.086322043309,"rank":1722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1802,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":8.5316,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
