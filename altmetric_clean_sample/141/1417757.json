We report the genotype combination of a recent cross-country champion (12 km race) in polymorphisms of seven genes that are candidates to influence endurance phenotype traits (ACTN3, ACE, PPARGC1A, AMPD1, CKMM, GDF8 (myostatin) and HFE). His data were compared with those of eight other runners (world-class but not world champions). The only athlete with the genotype theoretically more suited to attaining world-class endurance running performance was the case study subject. A favourable genetic endowment, together with exceptional environmental factors (years of altitude living and training in this case), seems to be necessary to attain the highest possible level of running endurance performance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002456","authors":["Gonzalez-Freire M","Santiago C","Verde Z","Lao JI","Oiivan J","G\u00f3mez-Gallego F","Lucia A","M Gonzalez-Freire","C Santiago","Z Verde","J I Lao","J OIivan","F Gomez-Gallego","A Lucia"],"doi":"10.1136\/bjsm.2008.049809","first_seen_on":"2013-04-28T10:19:29+00:00","issns":["0306-3674"],"issue":"4","journal":"British Journal of Sports Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1367144239,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/18662936\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18662936"],"pmid":"18662936","pubdate":"2008-07-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"B M J PUBLISHING GROUP","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Unique among unique.
