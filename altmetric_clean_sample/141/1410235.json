Two types of resins were used: potassium (K+) gel-type and sodium (Na+) macroporous resins. Influence of the cation and effect of the resin structure on adsorption were studied. The adsorption isotherms were determined by the static method in batch mode for mono-component and multi-component sugar mixtures, at 25 and 40 degrees C, in a range of concentrations between 5 and 250 g L(-1). All adsorption isotherms were fitted by a linear model in this range of concentrations. Sugars were adsorbed in both resins by the following order: fructose > glucose > sucrose. Sucrose was more adsorbed in the Na+ macroporous resin, glucose was identically adsorbed, and fructose was more adsorbed in the K+ gel-type resin. Data obtained from the adsorption of multi-component mixtures as compared to the mono-component ones showed a competitive effect on the adsorption at 25 degrees C, and a synergetic effect at 40 degrees C. The temperature increase conducted to a decrease on the adsorption capacity for mono-component sugar mixtures, and to an increase for the multi-component mixtures. Based on the selectivity results, K+ gel-type resin seems to be the best choice for the separation of fructose, glucose and sucrose, at 25 degrees C.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002249","authors":["Nobre C","Santos MJ","Dominguez A","Torres D","Rocha O","Peres AM","Rocha I","Ferreira EC","Teixeira JA","Rodrigues LR"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aca.2009.06.043","first_seen_on":"2013-04-24T22:11:02+00:00","issns":["00032670"],"issue":"1","journal":"Analytica Chimica Acta","last_mentioned_on":1367144647,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0003267009008368"],"pmid":"19850171","pubdate":"2009-03-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Comparison of adsorption equilibrium of fructose, glucose and sucrose on potassium gel-type and macroporous sodium ion-exchange resins ","type":"article","volume":"654","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-adsorption-equilibrium-fructose-glucose-sucrose-potassium-geltype-macroporous-sodium-ione"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4015886,"mean":5.0295650657943,"rank":2246094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1035406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4015886,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86128,"mean":6.780841385396,"rank":44744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":25900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86128,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":973,"mean":1.3061995884774,"rank":315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":973,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":2.1383720930233,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
