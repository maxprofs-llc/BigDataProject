FV release requires co-expression and a highly specific interaction between capsid (Gag) and glycoprotein (Env), which cannot be complemented by heterologous Env proteins. The interaction domain in FV Env has been mapped in greater detail and resides mainly in the N-terminal tip of the cytoplasmic domain of the Env leader peptide subunit. In contrast, the corresponding domain within Gag is less well defined. Previous investigations suggest that it is located within the N-terminal part of the protein.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5323cf058f6100044b1","doi":"10.1186\/1742-4690-10-45","first_seen_on":"2013-04-25T16:59:18+00:00","issns":["1742-4690"],"issue":"1","journal":"Retrovirology: Research & Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1366907844,"links":["http:\/\/www.retrovirology.com\/content\/10\/1\/45\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.retrovirology.com\/content\/pdf\/1742-4690-10-45.pdf","pmid":"23618494","pubdate":"2013-04-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"45","title":"An N-terminal domain helical motif of Prototype Foamy Virus Gag with dual functions essential for particle egress and viral infectivity","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nterminal-domain-helical-motif-prototype-foamy-virus-gag-dual-functions-essential-particle-egress-vi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3076208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":954481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88507,"mean":6.9737433168374,"rank":59889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":18252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88507,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":634,"mean":3.4693586097946,"rank":456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":634,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":3.1431428571429,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
