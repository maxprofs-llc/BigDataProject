MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that function as endogenous silencers of numerous target genes. Many miRNA genes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and play important roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Recent discoveries have shed new light on the involvement of miRNAs in gastric malignancy. However, at the same time, several miRNAs have been associated with opposing events, leading to reduced inflammation, inhibition of malignancy, and increased apoptosis of transformed cells. The regulation of miRNA expression could be a novel strategy in the chemoprevention of human gastric malignancy. In this article, the biological importance of miRNAs in gastric malignancy is summarized.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Toshihiro Nishizawa"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms14059487","first_seen_on":"2013-04-29T09:38:30+00:00","issns":["1422-0067",""],"issue":"5","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1367228180,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/14\/5\/9487"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/14\/5\/9487\/pdf","pmid":"23629677","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"The Role of microRNA in Gastric Malignancy","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-microrna-gastric-malignancy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4282690,"mean":5.0215424405332,"rank":3398004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":123825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4282690,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87578,"mean":6.7718578622241,"rank":68033,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87578,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1836,"mean":1.5662822888283,"rank":1043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1836,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.6708333333333,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
