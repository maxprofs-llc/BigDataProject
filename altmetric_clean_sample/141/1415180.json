It was only a matter of time before the seemingly inevitable \"marriage\" of this concept with another modern research obsession, the generation of \"smart\" polymers, capable of reacting quickly, accurately and reproducibly to changes in their environment. Many advances have since been made, concerning the quality and diversity of these systems and polymers responsive to temperature, pH and a host of other environmental cues now exist. This article provides a succinct overview of the process and outcomes of \"smart\" molecular imprinting, followed by a detailed assessment of recent developments and applications in such field.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008096","authors":["Ge, Yi","Butler, Benjamin","Mirza, Farhan","Habib\u2010Ullah, Sabeeh","Fei, Dan"],"doi":"10.1002\/marc.201300069","endpage":"915","first_seen_on":"2013-04-26T14:10:44+00:00","issns":["1521-3927","1022-1336"],"issue":"11","journal":"Macromolecular Rapid Communications","last_mentioned_on":1366985320,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/marc.201300069\/abstract;jsessionid=E3F09753ED5608300642BE62CC40B3E4.d01t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/marc.201300069\/pdf","pmid":"23625770","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"903","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Smart Molecularly Imprinted Polymers: Recent Developments and Applications","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/smart-molecularly-imprinted-polymers-recent-developments-applications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627924,"mean":4.9449041432285,"rank":2904973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627924,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84528,"mean":6.7419295373077,"rank":65728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84528,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1010,"mean":1.4081962338949,"rank":373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1010,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
