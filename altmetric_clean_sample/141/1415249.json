Similar actions are attributed to genistein, an isoflavonic phytoestrogen. The treatment with genistein activates the OT system in the aorta of ovariectomized (OVX) Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of low doses of genistein on the OT-induced effects in rat hypertension. The hypothesis tested was that treatment of OVX spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) with genistein improves heart structure and heart work through a mechanism involving the specific OT receptor (OTR). OVX SHRs or SD rats were treated with genistein (in microg\/g body wt sc, 10 days) in the presence or absence of an OT antagonist (OTA) [d(CH(2))(5), Tyr(Me)(2), Orn(8)]-vasotocin or a nonspecific estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI-182780). Vehicle-treated OVX rats served as controls. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated that left ventricular (LV) OTR, downregulated by ovariectomy, increased in response to genistein. In SHRs or SD rats, this effect was blocked by OTA or ICI-182780 administration. The OTR was mainly localized in microvessels expressing the CD31 marker and colocalized with endothelial nitric oxide synthase. In SHRs, the genistein-stimulated OTR increases were associated with improved fractional shortening, decreased blood pressure (12 mmHg), decreased heart weight-to-body weight ratio, decreased fibrosis, and lowered brain natriuretic peptide in the LV. The prominent finding of the study is the detrimental effect of OTA treatment on the LV of SHRs. OTA treatment of OVX SHRs resulted in a dramatic worsening of ejection fractions and an augmented fibrosis. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that cardiac OTRs are involved in the regulation of cardiac function of OVX SHRs. The decreases of OTRs may contribute to cardiac pathology following menopause.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002210","authors":["Marek Jankowski","Donghao Wang","Bogdan Danalache","Marius Gangal","Jolanta Gutkowska"],"doi":"10.1152\/ajpheart.00487.2009","first_seen_on":"2013-04-26T14:31:54+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["1522-1539","0363-6135"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal of Physiology: Heart & Circulatory Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1366902875,"links":["http:\/\/ajpheart.physiology.org\/content\/299\/2\/H265.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajpheart.physiology.org\/content\/299\/2\/H265.full.pdf","pmid":"20671291","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Physiological Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology","cardiology"],"title":"Cardiac oxytocin receptor blockade stimulates adverse cardiac remodeling in ovariectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats","type":"article","volume":"299","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cardiac-oxytocin-receptor-blockade-stimulates-adverse-cardiac-remodeling-ovariectomized-spontaneousl-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632408,"mean":4.9240837059336,"rank":2015257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632408,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84622,"mean":6.7069708228455,"rank":43564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":25677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84622,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":857,"mean":1.9946985981308,"rank":316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":857,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.4414,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
