However, the US Food and Drug Administration has recommended use with caution in patients with risk factors for rhabdomyolysis, based on four case reports of rhabdomyolysis in patients with identifiable risk factors. We present a 32-year-old Asian man with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but without other underlying diseases, who developed rapid-onset, raltegravir-associated rhabdomyolysis and hyperlactatemia. Our patient lacked predisposing factors for rhabdomyolysis, and the rapid onset time of 4 days was the shortest reported. Therefore, clinicians should exercise caution when using raltegravir and closely monitor all patients for the symptoms of muscle pain and weakness. This case has been reported to the National Adverse Drug Reactions Reporting System of the Department of Health in Taiwan.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d5c","doi":"10.1016\/j.jmii.2013.02.008","first_seen_on":"2013-04-25T10:44:00+00:00","issns":["1995-9133"],"journal":"Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection","last_mentioned_on":1366886526,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23612027?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23612027","pubdate":"2013-04-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Rapid onset of rhabdomyolysis after switching to a raltegravir-based antiretroviral regimen.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rapid-onset-rhabdomyolysis-after-switching-raltegravirbased-antiretroviral-regimen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3552984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88507,"mean":6.9739105371389,"rank":70272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88507,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191,"mean":1.4720315789474,"rank":122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.201,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
