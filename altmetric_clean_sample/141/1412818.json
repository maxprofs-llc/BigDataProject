Even among a subset of studies examining the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID), some have reported normal mental and psychomotor development while others have suggested a delay in motor development. Given an increasing number of infants exposed to SRIs, furthering our understanding of the possible developmental implications of SRI exposure in utero is critical.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002742","authors":["Hanley GE","Brain U","Oberlander TF"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.earlhumdev.2012.12.012","first_seen_on":"2013-04-25T17:46:02+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["0378-3782"],"issue":"","journal":"Early Human Development","last_mentioned_on":1453098600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23384962"],"pmid":"23384962","pubdate":"2013-02-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["embryology","perinatology","pediatrics"],"title":"Infant developmental outcomes following prenatal exposure to antidepressants, and maternal depressed mood and positive affect.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/infant-developmental-outcomes-following-prenatal-exposure-antidepressants-maternal-depressed-mood-po-10"},"altmetric_score":{"score":23.32,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":23.32},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6988129,"mean":6.2455122147134,"rank":283031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":6705118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6988129,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114137,"mean":6.639607696082,"rank":5598,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":108539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114137,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":599,"mean":3.644872909699,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":599,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.94444444444444,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
