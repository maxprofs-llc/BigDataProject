Our previous study in animal model showed Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and its downstream signaling molecules were associated with DPN. To assess the diagnostic values of TLR4, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 as biomarkers, here we detected their expressions in peripheral blood from normal controls, type 2 diabetic and DPN subjects. Both TLR4 mRNA and protein expressions increased significantly in DPN compare with both diabetic and control subjects. The protein levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were also raised significantly and correlated with TLR4 expression. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis suggested TLR4 and TNF-\u03b1 had great potential advantages to predict the progression of neuropathy, the risks of DPN were increased in subjects with higher TLR4 (odds ratio: 5.27; 95% CI: 1.02-26.40) and TNF-\u03b1 (odds ratio: 12.67; 95% CI: 2.35-68.22). These findings demonstrated TLR4 and TNF-\u03b1 could be potential sensitive diagnostic biomarkers for DPN in both general population and type 2 diabetic subjects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031ac","authors":["Zhu T","Meng Q","Ji J","Lou X","Zhang L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neulet.2014.11.020","first_seen_on":"2014-12-06T07:18:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0304-3940"],"issue":"","journal":"Neuroscience Letters","last_mentioned_on":1440065802,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25445373?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25445373"],"pmid":"25445373","pubdate":"2014-12-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Toll-like receptor 4 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha as diagnostic biomarkers for diabetic peripheral neuropathy.","type":"article","volume":"585C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tolllike-receptor-4-tumor-necrosis-factoralpha-diagnostic-biomarkers-diabetic-peripheral-neuropathy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5565812,"mean":6.3306026370649,"rank":3934665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":925513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5565812,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189512,"mean":8.0707784877924,"rank":126550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":39848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189512,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2519,"mean":3.1173288324067,"rank":1776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2519,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":1.7458709677419,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
