However, these diagnostic suggestions can sometimes be shown to vary widely across different CBTI programs even for identical MMPI-2 profiles. The present study evaluated the diagnostic reliability of 6 commercially available CBTIs using a 20-item Q-sort task developed for this study. Four raters each sorted diagnostic classifications based on these 6 CBTI reports for 20 MMPI-2 profiles. Two questions were addressed. First, do users of CBTIs understand the diagnostic information contained within the reports similarly? Overall, diagnostic sorts of the CBTIs showed moderate inter-interpreter diagnostic reliability (mean r = .56), with sorts for the 1\/2\/3 profile showing the highest inter-interpreter diagnostic reliability (mean r = .67). Second, do different CBTIs programs vary with respect to diagnostic suggestions? It was found that diagnostic sorts of the CBTIs had a mean inter-CBTI diagnostic reliability of r = .56, indicating moderate but not strong agreement across CBTIs in terms of diagnostic suggestions. The strongest inter-CBTI diagnostic agreement was found for sorts of the 1\/2\/3 profile CBTIs (mean r = .71). Limitations and future directions are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d7","doi":"10.1037\/a0036469","first_seen_on":"2014-12-06T03:31:37+00:00","issns":["1040-3590 (Print)"],"journal":"Psychological Assessment","last_mentioned_on":1417836674,"links":["http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&id=2014-14376-001"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/journals\/pas\/26\/3\/916.pdf","pmid":"24749753","publisher":"American Psychological Association","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Business And Management","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Diagnostic reliability of MMPI-2 computer-based test interpretations.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diagnostic-reliability-mmpi2-computerbased-test-interpretations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4587710,"mean":5.3845268165588,"rank":2204161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2253456,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4587710,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148221,"mean":8.3099828093376,"rank":67409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":74399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148221,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":334,"mean":3.3098018018018,"rank":159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":334,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":13.572727272727,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
