Herein, small molecules that inhibit HIF-1\u03b1 protein stability by targeting mitochondrial energy production were screened using the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds and cell growth assay in galactose or glucose medium. NNC 55-0396, a T-type Ca(2+) channel inhibitor, was selected as a hit from among 1,280 small molecules. NNC 55-0396 suppressed mitochondrial reactive oxygen species-mediated HIF-1\u03b1 expression as well as stabilization by inhibiting protein synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. NNC 55-0396 inhibited tumor-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo by suppressing HIF-1\u03b1 stability. Moreover, NNC 55-0396 significantly suppressed glioblastoma tumor growth in a xenograft model. Thus, NNC 55-0396, a small molecule targeting T-type Ca(2+) channel, was identified by the systemic cell-based assay and was shown to have antiangiogenic activity via the suppression of HIF-1\u03b1 signal transduction. These results provide new insights into the biological network between ion channel and HIF-1\u03b1 signal transduction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e63","authors":["Ki Hyun Kim","Dongyoung Kim","Ju Yeol Park","Hye Jin Jung","Yong-Hee Cho","Hyoung Kyu Kim","Jin Han","Kang-Yell Choi","Ho Jeong Kwon"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00109-014-1235-1","first_seen_on":"2014-12-05T20:57:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-1440"],"journal":"Journal of Molecular Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1417812963,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25471482?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25471482","pubdate":"2014-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Molecular Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","geneticsmedical"],"title":"NNC 55-0396, a T-type Ca(2+) channel inhibitor, inhibits angiogenesis via suppression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 signal transduction.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nnc-550396-ttype-ca2-channel-inhibitor-inhibits-angiogenesis-via-suppression-hypoxiainducible-factor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4586246,"mean":5.382841503168,"rank":3716664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":141452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4586246,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147758,"mean":8.23927333392,"rank":115742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147758,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":422,"mean":2.7499002375297,"rank":302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":422,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":3.7236153846154,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
