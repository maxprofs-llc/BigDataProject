Polymorphisms in three genes--SLC24A5, TYR, and SLC45A2--yielded highly significant replicated associations with skin-reflectance measurements, an indirect measure of melanin content in the skin. The associations detected in these three genes, in an additive manner, collectively account for a large fraction of the natural variation of skin pigmentation in a South Asian population. Our study is the first to interrogate polymorphisms across the genome, to find genetic determinants of the natural variation of skin pigmentation within a human population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ff","authors":["Stokowski, Renee P","Pant, P V Krishna","Dadd, Tony","Fereday, Amelia","Hinds, David A","Jarman, Carl","Filsell, Wendy","Ginger, Rebecca S","Green, Martin R","van der Ouderaa, Frans J","Cox, David R","Renee P.
