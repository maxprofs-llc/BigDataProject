Analysis of human NP tissues showed that XT-1 expression is unaffected by degeneration severity; XT-1 and c-Jun, c-Fos, and Sp1 mRNA were positively correlated. Cytokines failed to inhibit XT-1 promoter activity and expression. However, cytokines decreased activity of XT-1 promoters containing deletion and mutation of the -730\/-723 bp AP-1 motif, prompting us to investigate the role of AP-1 and Sp1\/Sp3 in the regulation of XT-1 in healthy NP cells. Overexpression and suppression of AP-1 modulated XT-1 promoter activity. Likewise, treatment with the Sp1 inhibitors WP631 and mithramycin A or cotransfection with the plasmid DN-Sp1 decreased XT-1 promoter activity. Inhibitors of AP-1 and Sp1 and stable knockdown of Sp1 and Sp3 resulted in decreased XT-1 expression in NP cells. Genomic chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed AP-1 binding to motifs located at -730\/-723 bp and -684\/-677 bp and Sp1 binding to -227\/-217 bp and -124\/-114 bp in XT-1 promoter. These results suggest that XT-1 expression is refractory to the disease process and to inhibition by inflammatory cytokines and that signaling through AP-1, Sp1, and Sp3 is important in the maintenance of XT-1 levels in NP cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006988","authors":["Wei Ye","Jie Zhou","Dessislava Z Markova","Ye Tian","Jun Li","D Greg Anderson","Irving M Shapiro","Makarand V Risbud"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajpath.2014.09.021","first_seen_on":"2014-12-06T14:33:34+00:00","funders":["niehs","niams","nci"],"issns":["1525-2191"],"journal":"American Journal of Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1417913733,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25476526?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25476526","pubdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Xylosyltransferase-1 Expression Is Refractory to Inhibition by the Inflammatory Cytokines Tumor Necrosis Factor \u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in Nucleus Pulposus Cells: Novel Regulation by AP-1, Sp1, and Sp3.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/xylosyltransferase1-expression-refractory-inhibition-inflammatory-cytokines-tumor-necrosis-factor-%CE%B1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4591036,"mean":5.3874845613204,"rank":3141323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":870796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4591036,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148336,"mean":8.3117701688746,"rank":99241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":32104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148336,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1643,"mean":3.4050706455542,"rank":1091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1643,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":7.0991162790698,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
