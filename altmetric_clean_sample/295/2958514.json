Here, we show that reprogramming in the presence of small molecules preserved the genomic stability of iPSCs by inhibiting DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and activating Zscan4 gene. Surprisingly, the small molecules protected normal karyotype by facilitating repair of the DSBs that occurred during the early reprogramming process and long-term culture of iPSCs. The stemness and cell growth of iPSCs(+) were normally sustained with high expression of pluripotency genes compared that of iPSCs(-). Moreover, small molecules maintained the differentiation potential of iPSCs(+) for the three germ layers, whereas it was lost in iPSCs(-). Our results demonstrate that the defined small molecules are potent factors for generation of high quality iPSCs with preservation of genomic integrity by facilitating the reprogramming process.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e8","authors":["Hang-Soo Park","Insik Hwang","Kyung-Ah Choi","Hyesun Jeong","Ji-Yun Lee","Sunghoi Hong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biomaterials.2014.10.055","first_seen_on":"2014-12-06T12:04:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-5905","01429612"],"journal":"Biomaterials","last_mentioned_on":1421594343,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25477171?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0142961214011193"],"pmid":"25477171","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells without genetic defects by small molecules ","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/generation-induced-pluripotent-stem-cells-without-genetic-defects-small-molecules"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":2316564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2592593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174826,"mean":8.1027382239383,"rank":72590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":96672,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174826,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1797,"mean":4.7062115812918,"rank":638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1797,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":2.9141875,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
