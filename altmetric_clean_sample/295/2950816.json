Currently, little information is available to predict the patient response to bortezomib treatment. In this study, we aimed to identify patients benefiting minimally from bortezomib as part of the first-line therapy and define high-risk MM in the context of bortezomib treatment. We compared the effect of a bortezomib-based treatment (arm B) with that of a standard treatment without bortezomib (arm A) on different genetic patient subgroups in a series of 273 cases of newly diagnosed MM. These patients were enrolled in a prospective, nonrandomized clinical trial (BDH 2008\/02). A subgroup of patients showing little benefit from bortezomib treatment was identified. These patients had at least one of the following characteristics: del(17p13),1q21 gains or high LDH. In this subgroup, the survival of patients treated with bortezomib was comparable progression-free survival (14.0 vs 15.0 months, p=0.992) and overall survival (21.0 vs 14.0 months, p=0.472) to that of patients undergoing thalidomide-based treatment. We propose that all patients with newly diagnosed MM should be evaluated for these three markers before bortezomib treatment. Other novel drugs and alternative therapeutic strategies are needed for these patients with such markers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002895","authors":["Gang
