This direct interaction of tRNA with amino acids is catalyzed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified compound heterozygous mutations [c.169T>C (p.Tyr57His) and c.1485dup (p.Lys496*)] in QARS, which encodes glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, in two siblings with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE). Recessive mutations in QARS, including the loss-of-function missense mutation p.Tyr57His, have been reported to cause intractable seizures with progressive microcephaly. The p.Lys496* mutation is novel and causes truncation of the QARS protein, leading to a deletion of part of the catalytic domain and the entire anticodon-binding domain. Transient expression of the p.Lys496* mutant in neuroblastoma 2A cells revealed diminished and aberrantly aggregated expression, indicating the loss-of-function nature of this mutant. Together with the previous report, our data suggest that abnormal aminoacylation is one of the underlying pathologies of EOEE.Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 4 December 2014; doi:10.1038\/jhg.2014.103.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002de4","authors":["Hirofumi Kodera","Hitoshi Osaka","Mizue Iai","Noriko Aida","Akio Yamashita","Yoshinori Tsurusaki","Mitsuko Nakashima","Noriko Miyake","Hirotomo Saitsu","Naomichi Matsumoto"],"doi":"10.1038\/jhg.2014.103","first_seen_on":"2014-12-05T06:39:13+00:00","issns":["1434-5161","1435-232X"],"journal":"Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1426787572,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/jhg\/rss\/aop\/~3\/IknSfSoAqow\/jhg.2014.103","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25471517?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25471517?utm_content=bufferb47b1&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25471517?utm_content=buffer9265e&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/jhg\/journal\/v60\/n2\/full\/jhg2014103a.html"],"pmid":"25471517","pubdate":"2014-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Epilepsy","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Next-generation sequencing","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Mutations in the glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase gene cause early-onset epileptic encephalopathy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mutations-glutaminyltrna-synthetase-gene-cause-earlyonset-epileptic-encephalopathy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4892661,"mean":5.8194423569203,"rank":362831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":4526670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4892661,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168812,"mean":8.0061337590562,"rank":16843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":151857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168812,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":663,"mean":5.3021963746224,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":663,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":9.2980769230769,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
