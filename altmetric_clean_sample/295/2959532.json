The objective of the present study was to determine the distribution of lamprey GnRH-III in the brains of adult sea lampreys and to compare it to the distribution of lamprey GnRH-I. For this purpose, two kinds of immunostaining were employed: one was a single immunostaining by one of two GnRH antibodies using two successive sections; the other was double immunostaining of a single section. A dense accumulation of neuronal cells immunoreactive (ir) to antisera against either lamprey GnRH-I or -III was found in the arc-shaped preoptico-anterior hypothalamic area. Additional smaller numbers of irGnRH cells were found in the periventricular zone of the posterior hypothalamus. In the above-mentioned locations, the distribution of both irGnRH-I and -III cells was intermixed and very similar, but the cells exhibiting GnRH-III immunoreactivity were distinctly different from those exhibiting GnRH-I immunoreactivity. The relative numbers of irGnRH-III cells were larger than those of irGnRH-I cells in the preoptico-anterior hypothalamic area, and more than 90% of GnRH cells in the posterior hypothalamus were irGnRH-III cells. Both irGnRH-I and -III cells projected their fibers primarily into the neurohypophysis. The relative densities of the accumulated irGnRH-III fibers were similar to those of irGnRH-I fibers in the anterior neurohypophysis but higher than those of irGnRH-I fibers in the posterior neurohypophysis. The present study provides further immunocytochemical data to the already compelling physiological evidence that indicates that both lamprey GnRH-I and -III act through the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis to modulate reproductive processes in the sea lamprey.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002936","authors":["M Nozaki","K Ominato","A Gorbman","S A Sower"],"doi":"10.1006\/gcen.1999.7451","first_seen_on":"2014-12-06T23:40:17+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0016-6480"],"issue":"1","journal":"General & Comparative Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1417909211,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10753567"],"pmid":"10753567","pubdate":"2000-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"The distribution of lamprey GnRH-III in brains of adult sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus).","type":"article","volume":"118","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/distribution-lamprey-gnrhiii-brains-adult-sea-lampreys-petromyzon-marinus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4587710,"mean":5.3845268165588,"rank":3717996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":141519,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4587710,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148221,"mean":8.3099919174201,"rank":116157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148221,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":521,"mean":1.7103846153846,"rank":349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":521,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.3805555555556,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
