Geriatric Nursing Education Consortium (GNEC), a collaborative program of the John A. Hartford Foundation, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, and the New York University (NYU) Nursing Hartford Institute for Geriatric Nursing, was initiated to provide faculty with the necessary skills, knowledge, and competency to implement sustainable curricular innovations in care of older adults. This article describes the background, step-by-step process approach to the development of GNEC evidence-based curricular materials, and the dissemination of these materials through 6-, 2-, and a half-day national Faculty Development Institutes (FDIs). Eight hundred eight faculty, representing 418 schools of nursing, attended. A total of 479 individuals responded to an evaluation conducted by Baruch College that showed faculty feasibility to incorporate GNEC content into courses, confidence in teaching and incorporating content, and overall high rating of the GNEC materials. The impact of GNEC is discussed along with effects on faculty participants over 2 years. Administrative- and faculty-level recommendations to sustain and expand GNEC are highlighted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a94","authors":["Gray-Miceli D","Wilson LD","Stanley J","Watman R","Shire A","Sofaer S","Mezey M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.profnurs.2014.05.001","first_seen_on":"2014-12-05T18:10:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["87557223"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Professional Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1421311000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25455325","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S8755722314000738"],"pmid":"25455325","pubdate":"2014-12-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Improving the Quality of Geriatric Nursing Care: Enduring Outcomes From the Geriatric Nursing Education Consortium ","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improving-quality-geriatric-nursing-care-enduring-outcomes-geriatric-nursing-education-consortium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4739474,"mean":5.4857892300663,"rank":2290668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":2310412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4739474,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153880,"mean":8.2358579143353,"rank":70334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":76583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153880,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":1.9105,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
