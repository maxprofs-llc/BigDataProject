A flesh-colored, dome-shaped papulonodule is usually located on the face or the neck. These papulonodules may be single or multiple. Histologically, the lesion consists of a concentric arrangement of cellular fibrous tissue around a normal hair follicle. We describe here an unusual case of PFF in a 41-year-old female who had an asymptomatic small skin colored papule on the scalp, and this is an uncommon location for PFF.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbcc","authors":["Jae-Hui Nam","Joon Hong Min","Ga-Young Lee","Won-Serk Kim"],"doi":"10.5021\/ad.2011.23.2.236","first_seen_on":"2014-12-06T23:33:54+00:00","issns":["1013-9087"],"issue":"2","journal":"Annals of Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1417908819,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3130873\/pdf\/ad-23-236.pdf"],"pmid":"21747629","pubdate":"2011-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Korean Dermatological Association","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"236","title":"A Case of Perifollicular Fibroma","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/case-perifollicular-fibroma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4588073,"mean":5.3836843256571,"rank":3139020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":870034,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4588073,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148223,"mean":8.3089715561793,"rank":99160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":32074,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148223,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203,"mean":1.9128613861386,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":0.50645161290323,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mafedaSkinPath\/status\/541374942617403392","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2959525],"posted_on":"2014-12-06T23:33:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Mario F.
