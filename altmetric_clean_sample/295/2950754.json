In pregnant women, periodontitis is thought to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, although the pathophysiology is unknown. Additionally, smoking is an established risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. In the present study, we examined the direct effects of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharides (PGLPS) and nicotine on a trophoblast cell line.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008eed","authors":["S Komine-Aizawa","N Hirohata","S Aizawa","Y Abiko","S Hayakawa"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.placenta.2014.10.015","first_seen_on":"2014-12-04T19:05:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-3102"],"journal":"Placenta","last_mentioned_on":1440306483,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25468545?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25468545","pubdate":"2014-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["obstetrics","embryology","physiology"],"title":"Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide inhibits trophoblast invasion in the presence of nicotine.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/porphyromonas-gingivalis-lipopolysaccharide-inhibits-trophoblast-invasion-presence-nicotine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5573550,"mean":6.3364647297446,"rank":2933574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1874842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5573550,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189198,"mean":8.0076180806251,"rank":95315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":71952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189198,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":803,"mean":1.8326408977556,"rank":205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":803,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":3.1378205128205,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/status\/540582450112393216","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2950754],"posted_on":"2014-12-04T19:04:34+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"540582450112393216"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/635317553544359936","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[2950754],"posted_on":"2015-08-23T05:08:03+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"635317553544359936"}]}}
