The epidemiology of malaria in Hainan and Yunnan provinces was disparate, even though distinct malaria control strategies have been adapted to different situations based on risk group, vector behaviours, local health infrastructure, and environmental conditions. The island Hainan appears to be victorious in eliminating malaria. However, there is still a long way to go to prevent the reintroduction of malaria in Hainan province and eliminating malaria in the border areas of Yunnan province. This review of the experiences and challenges from malaria control to elimination in Hainan and Yunnan provinces of southern China will provide a basis for the future elimination of malaria in the whole country.","abstract_source":"pubmed","aggregated_in":[],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002192","authors":["Zhi-Gui Xia","Li Zhang","Jun Feng","Mei Li","Xin-Yu Feng","Lin-Hua Tang","Shan-Qing Wang","Heng-Lin Yang","Qi Gao","Randall Kramer","Tambo Ernest","Peiling Yap","Xiao-Nong Zhou","Xia ZG","Zhang L","Feng J","Li M","Feng XY","Tang LH","Wang SQ","Yang HL","Gao Q","Kramer R","Ernest T","Yap P","Zhou XN","Xia, Zhi-Gui","Zhang, Li","Feng, Jun","Li, Mei","Feng, Xin-Yu","Tang, Lin-Hua","Wang, Shan-Qing","Yang, Heng-Lin","Gao, Qi","Kramer, Randall","Ernest, Tambo","Yap, Peiling","Zhou, Xiao-Nong"],"book":{"isbns":["9780128008690"]},"doi":"10.1016\/b978-0-12-800869-0.00003-2","first_seen_on":"2014-12-06T11:58:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0065-308X","0065308X"],"journal":"Advances in Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1417864276,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25476881?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25476881","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Lessons from malaria control to elimination: case study in hainan and yunnan provinces.","type":"chapter","volume":"86","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lessons-malaria-control-elimination-case-study-hainan-yunnan-provinces"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4587710,"mean":5.3845268165588,"rank":3138961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":870026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4587710,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148221,"mean":8.3099895560654,"rank":99165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":32065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148221,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":2.7697118644068,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":27.45,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
