In the present article, the authors have endeavoured to provide clarification of some current issues by referencing the current literature, including the 2012 Canadian Fibromyalgia Guidelines. While FM is accepted as a valid condition, its diagnosis is vulnerable to misuse due to the subjectivity of symptoms. Without a defining cause, a physical or psychological event may be alleged to trigger FM, but adjudication of causation must be prudent. Although some individuals may experience severe symptoms, the prevalent societal concept of disablement due to FM must be tempered with the knowledge that working contributes to psychosocial wellbeing. Evidence provided in the present report may assist the courts in reaching decisions concerning FM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d33cf058f610000ecf","authors":["Mary-Ann Fitzcharles","Peter A Ste-Marie","Angela Mailis","Yoram Shir"],"first_seen_on":"2014-12-06T11:34:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1918-1523"],"issue":"6","journal":"Pain Research & Management : The Journal of the Canadian Pain Society","last_mentioned_on":1417865581,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25479148?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pmid":"25479148","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Adjudication of fibromyalgia syndrome: Challenges in the medicolegal arena.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adjudication-fibromyalgia-syndrome-challenges-medicolegal-arena"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":2668169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1698991,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174827,"mean":8.1027038884378,"rank":88691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":64986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174827,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154,"mean":6.0874901960784,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.54,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Psychology":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/fmauk\/status\/541193591960256512","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2958368],"posted_on":"2014-12-06T11:33:01+00:00","author":{"name":"FMA UK","url":"http:\/\/www.fmauk.org","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1353706770\/fib-logo-transparent_withFMAUKText400_normal.png","description":"UK charity raising awareness for fibromyalgia.\r\nTweets by DesQ, HazelB & FionaW","id_on_source":"fmauk","tweeter_id":"86183371","geo":{"lt":"54.7023545","ln":"-3.2765753","country":"GB"},"followers":2643},"tweet_id":"541193591960256512"}]}}
