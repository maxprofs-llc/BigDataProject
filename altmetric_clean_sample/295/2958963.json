This work aimed to determine if phenotypes that are important to define microbial activity in foods such as biofilm formation, swarming motility and proteolytic activity of two Pseudomonas fluorescens strains, isolated from refrigerated raw milk, are influenced by AHL molecules. The tested P. fluorescens strains did not produce AHL molecules in none of the evaluated media. We found that biofilm formation was dependent on the culture media, but it was not influenced by AHLs. Our results indicate that biofilm formation, swarming motility and proteolytic activity of the tested P. fluorescens strains are not regulated by acyl-homoserine lactones. It is likely that AHL-dependent quorum sensing system is absent from these strains.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006cf3","authors":["Maurilio L Martins","Uelinton M Pinto","Kathrin Riedel","Maria C D Vanetti","Hil\u00e1rio C Mantovani","Elza F de Ara\u00fajo"],"first_seen_on":"2014-12-06T16:27:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1678-4405"],"issue":"3","journal":"Brazilian Journal of Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1417883013,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25477941?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25477941","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Lack of AHL-based quorum sensing in Pseudomonas fluorescens isolated from milk.","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lack-ahlbased-quorum-sensing-pseudomonas-fluorescens-isolated-milk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4655094,"mean":5.6505438971925,"rank":2471816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1552333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4655094,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154988,"mean":8.2907890468234,"rank":79158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":56852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154988,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242,"mean":1.1332697095436,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
