In low and middle-income countries (LMICs), there is evidence that many people are unable to access the health services they need due to financial and other barriers. There are growing calls for fairer health financing systems that will protect people from catastrophic and impoverishing health payments in times of illness. This study aims to assess equity in healthcare financing in Fiji and Timor-Leste in order to support government efforts to improve access to healthcare and move towards universal health coverage in the two countries.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Augustine D Asante","Jennifer Price","Andrew Hayen","Wayne Irava","Joao Martins","Lorna Guinness","John E Ataguba","Supon Limwattananon","Anne Mills","Stephen Jan","Virginia Wiseman","Asante AD","Price J","Hayen A","Irava W","Martins J","Guinness L","Ataguba JE","Limwattananon S","Mills A","Jan S","Wiseman V"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2014-006806","first_seen_on":"2014-12-05T01:04:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2044-6055",""],"issue":"12","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1437559935,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25468509?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25468509","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"e006806","title":"Assessment of equity in healthcare financing in Fiji and Timor-Leste: a study protocol.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/lookup\/doi\/10.1136\/bmjopen-2014-006806","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessment-equity-healthcare-financing-fiji-timorleste-study-protocol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7306409,"mean":6.3705710494094,"rank":5517983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993728,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7306409,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231781,"mean":7.4118417205973,"rank":151313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":47267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231781,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5009,"mean":16.840568690096,"rank":4291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5009,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177,"mean":21.873181818182,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
