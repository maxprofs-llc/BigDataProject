This study examined differences in psychopathology between immigrant and non-immigrant adolescents admitted for the first time to a child and adolescent inpatient psychiatry unit. Participants were 234 adolescents (191 non-immigrants and 43 immigrants). There were significant differences between the two groups in relation to certain stressors: parental separation, family breakdown, being under state custody, physical and\/or psychological maltreatment and sexual abuse. Differences between the main diagnoses of the two groups were found in relation to schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa. There are differences between immigrants and natives in terms of diagnosis, and these differences are influenced by ethnicity and stressors. Future studies should seek to identify protective factors in order to prevent mental health disorders in the immigrant population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dee","authors":["Ana Bl\u00e1zquez","Josefina Castro-Fornieles","Inmaculada Baeza","Astrid Morer","Esteban Mart\u00ednez","Luisa L\u00e1zaro"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10903-014-0143-3","first_seen_on":"2014-12-04T18:43:38+00:00","issns":["1557-1920","1557-1912"],"journal":"Journal of Immigrant & Minority Health","last_mentioned_on":1417866037,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10903-014-0143-3","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25476167?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10903-014-0143-3.pdf","pmid":"25476167","pubdate":"2014-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","socialsciences"],"title":"Differences in Psychopathology Between Immigrant and Native Adolescents Admitted to a Psychiatric Inpatient Unit.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differences-psychopathology-between-immigrant-native-adolescents-admitted-psychiatric-inpatient-unit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4781719,"mean":5.7259836017116,"rank":3199187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1393836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4781719,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162594,"mean":8.1308890911665,"rank":102988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":52467,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162594,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":404,"mean":2.3021240694789,"rank":246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":404,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.24375,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
