At the outset it sounds excellent for the use in the elderly diabetic population, because of its minimal tendency to cause hypoglycemia. However, the clinician needs to exercise caution as it needs to be dosed renally. The clinician needs to be circumspect about potential drug interactions, especially when there is an underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD) and congestive heart failure (CHF). Also its use is best avoided in people who are predisposed to genital mycotic and urinary tract infections (UTI).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040a3","authors":["Sehgal V","Bajwa SJ","Sehgal R","Consalvo JA"],"doi":"10.4103\/0976-500x.142428","first_seen_on":"2014-12-06T16:28:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0976-500X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Pharmacology & Pharmacotherapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1418135541,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25422561"],"pmcid":"PMC4231550","pmid":"25422561","pubdate":"2014-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Management of diabetes in the elderly with canagliflozin: A newer hypoglycemic drug on the horizon.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-diabetes-elderly-canagliflozin-newer-hypoglycemic-drug-horizon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4751646,"mean":5.7094676731992,"rank":2311937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2392946,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4751646,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160904,"mean":8.2186978490149,"rank":72212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":87055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160904,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":2.1435514018692,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.3,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Social Sciences":2,"Psychology":1,"Computer Science":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CF":1},"mendeley":{"PT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tcmclibrary\/status\/541266802194792448","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2958967],"posted_on":"2014-12-06T16:23:56+00:00","author":{"name":"TCMC Medical Library","url":"http:\/\/library.tcmedc.org\/blog\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/657214673968898048\/RRuNpNWI_normal.png","description":"The Commonwealth Medical College Library provides resources and services to the students, staff and faculty of TCMC and surrounding health care community.","id_on_source":"tcmclibrary","tweeter_id":"38734877","geo":{"lt":"41.408969","ln":"-75.6624122","country":"US"},"followers":325},"tweet_id":"541266802194792448"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TCMCnepa\/status\/542325884704026625","license":"datasift","rt":["tcmclibrary"],"citation_ids":[2958967],"posted_on":"2014-12-09T14:32:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Geisinger Cwlth SOM","url":"http:\/\/geisinger.edu\/gcsom","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/815470221570015232\/98qPv-cX_normal.jpg","description":"Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine: Community-based, patient-centered, innovative eduction.","id_on_source":"TCMCnepa","tweeter_id":"140924372","geo":{"lt":7,"ln":21,"country":"CF"},"followers":1621},"tweet_id":"542325884704026625"}]}}
