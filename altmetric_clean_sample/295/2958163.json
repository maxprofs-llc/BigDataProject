Three of these compounds showed an interesting profile of activity. In particular, deacetylserrulatin B (2) and euphosquamosin C (6) strongly inhibited the drug-efflux activity of the primary ABC-transporter CaCdr1p, an effect that translated, in a yeast strain overexpressing this transporter, into an increased sensitivity to fluconazole. These compounds were transported by CaCdr1p, as shown by the observation of an 11-14-fold cross-resistance of yeast growth, and could also inhibit the secondary MFS-transporter CaMdr1p. In contrast, euphosquamosin A (4) was selective for CaCdr1p, possibly as a result of a different binding mode. Taken together, these observations suggest jatrophane diterpenes to be a new class of potent inhibitors of multidrug transporters critical for drug resistance in pathogenic yeasts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d8b","authors":["Rawal MK","Shokoohinia Y","Chianese G","Zolfaghari B","Appendino G","Taglialatela-Scafati O","Prasad R","Di Pietro A"],"doi":"10.1021\/np500756z","first_seen_on":"2014-12-06T10:54:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0163-3864"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Natural Products","last_mentioned_on":1417518785,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25437914?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25437914","pubdate":"2014-12-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Jatrophanes from Euphorbia squamosa as Potent Inhibitors of Candida albicans Multidrug Transporters.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/jatrophanes-euphorbia-squamosa-potent-inhibitors-candida-albicans-multidrug-transporters"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4575816,"mean":5.3764004311399,"rank":3708222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":141149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4575816,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147689,"mean":8.2622487135042,"rank":115747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147689,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1168,"mean":2.9793316195373,"rank":941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1168,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":2.1963243243243,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
