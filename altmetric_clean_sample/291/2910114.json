However, further understanding of their biological behavior and potential application has been hampered by the limitations of current labeling techniques. Herein, a universal donor-cell-assisted membrane biotinylation strategy was proposed for labeling MPs by skillfully utilizing the natural membrane phospholipid exchange of their donor cells. This innovative strategy conveniently led to specific, efficient, reproducible, and biocompatible quantum dot (QD) labeling of MPs, thereby reliably conferring valuable traceability on MPs. By further loading with small interference RNA, QD-labeled MPs that had inherent cell-targeting and biomolecule-conveying ability were successfully employed for combined bioimaging and tumor-targeted therapy. This study provides the first reliable and biofriendly strategy for transforming biogenic MPs into functionalized nanovectors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Chen G","Zhu JY","Zhang ZL","Zhang W","Ren JG","Wu M","Hong ZY","Lv C","Pang DW","Zhao YF","Chen, Gang","Zhu, Jun\u2010Yi","Zhang, Zhi\u2010Ling","Zhang, Wei","Ren, Jian\u2010Gang","Wu, Min","Hong, Zheng\u2010Yuan","Lv, Cheng","Pang, Dai\u2010Wen","Zhao, Yi\u2010Fang"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201410223","endpage":"1040","first_seen_on":"2014-11-20T23:10:50+00:00","issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"3","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
