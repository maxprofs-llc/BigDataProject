Spontaneous regression of HCC has been defined as the disappearance of the hepatic lesions in the absence of any specific therapy. The spontaneous regression of a very large HCC is very rare and limited data is available in the English literature. We describe spontaneous regression of hepatocellular carcinoma in a 65-year-old male who presented to our clinic with vague abdominal pain and weight loss of two months duration. He was found to have multiple hepatic lesions with elevation of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level to 6,500 \u00b5g\/L (normal <20 \u00b5g\/L). Computed tomography revealed advanced HCC replacing almost 80% of the right hepatic lobe. Without any intervention the patient showed gradual improvement over a period of few months. Follow-up CT scan revealed disappearance of hepatic lesions with progressive decline of AFP levels to normal. Various mechanisms have been postulated to explain this rare phenomenon, but the exact mechanism remains a mystery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5253cf058f610003ceb","authors":["Adel Alqutub","David Peck","Paul Marotta"],"doi":"10.3205\/000130","first_seen_on":"2014-11-23T10:13:09+00:00","issns":[""],"journal":"GMS German Medical Science","last_mentioned_on":1416737575,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3070436\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3070436","pmid":"21468325","pubdate":"2014-11-23T20:11:00+00:00","publisher":"German Medical Science","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Spontaneous regression of a large hepatocellular carcinoma: case report","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spontaneous-regression-large-hepatocellular-carcinoma-case-report-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4540307,"mean":5.2995083963578,"rank":3680031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":139428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4540307,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141580,"mean":8.1541922742781,"rank":110813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141580,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":1.5672857142857,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Spontaneous regression of a large hepatocellular carcinoma: case report","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1316045702\/posts\/10205517902649712","license":"public","citation_ids":[2916523],"posted_on":"2014-11-23T10:12:55+00:00","summary":"The media is full of news reports on the conferring of sainthood of two spiritual personalities from Kerala.
