Moreover, as intercollegiate athletic involvement increases, so too does alcohol consumption. There is little research, however, which examines drinking behaviors of students who participate in nonvarsity athletics. Objectives: Identify differences in alcohol-related behaviors and associated consequences among U.S. varsity, club, and intramural athletes, and nonathlete college students. Methods: Secondary data analysis of the 2011 National College Health Assessment (n = 29,939). Results: Intramural athletes binge drank more frequently (M = 1.1, SD = 1.7) than club athletes (M = 1.0, SD = 1.6), intercollegiate athletes (M = 0.9, SD = 1.5), and nonathletes (M = 0.6, SD = 1.3) and also experienced greater alcohol-related consequences. Intramural athletes consumed the most during their last drinking episode (M = 4.1, SD = 4.0) and reached the highest blood alcohol concentration (BAC) (M = 0.062, SD = 0.09).Compared to club and varsity athletes [M = 0.8, SD = 1.4; t (8,131) = -9.6, p < .001], intramural-only athletes reported binge drinking significantly more frequently (M = 1.2, SD = 1.7) and also reached significantly higher BACs during most recent drinking episode (M = 0.064, SD = 0.08) than organized sport athletes [M = 0.057, SD = 0.08; t (8,050) = -3.0, p = .003]. Conclusions: Intramural athletes represent a higher-risk drinking group than other athlete and nonathlete college students. Future research should investigate factors contributing to drinking differences among different athlete groups.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5373cf058f610004624","authors":["Adam E Barry","Steven M Howell","Adam Riplinger","Anna K Piazza-Gardner"],"doi":"10.3109\/10826084.2014.977398","first_seen_on":"2014-11-22T09:28:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-2491"],"journal":"Substance Use & Misuse","last_mentioned_on":1416648522,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25412412?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25412412","pubdate":"2014-11-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Alcohol Use among College Athletes: Do Intercollegiate, Club, or Intramural Student Athletes Drink Differently?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alcohol-among-college-athletes-intercollegiate-club-intramural-student-athletes-drink-differently"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4535870,"mean":5.2916439022609,"rank":2328050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1610445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4535870,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141097,"mean":8.1144455406249,"rank":70664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":53495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141097,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":527,"mean":3.6662737642586,"rank":274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":527,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":3.247619047619,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
