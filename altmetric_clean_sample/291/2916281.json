To test this we analysed resting state fMRI changes in a cohort of fluctuating DLB patients (n\u00a0=\u00a016) compared with age matched controls (n\u00a0=\u00a017) with the aim of finding functional connectivity (FC) differences between these two groups and whether these associate with cognitive fluctuations in DLB. Resting state networks (RSNs) were estimated using independent component analysis and FC between the RSN maps and the entirety of the brain was assessed using dual regression. The default mode network (DMN) appeared unaffected in DLB compared to controls but significant cluster differences between DLB and controls were found for the left fronto-parietal, temporal, and sensory-motor networks. Desynchronization of a number of cortical and subcortical areas related to the left fronto-parietal network was associated with the severity and frequency of cognitive fluctuations. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the potential role of attention-executive networks in the aetiology of this core symptom in DLB.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"521611573cf058827c000015","authors":["Peraza LR","Kaiser M","Firbank M","Graziadio S","Bonanni L","Onofrj M","Colloby SJ","Blamire A","O'Brien J","Taylor JP","Luis R.
