Young survivors face the prospect of a diminished fertility as a consequence of the gonadotoxic chemotherapy, and many are seeking ways to preserve their fertility. Embryo and\/or oocyte cryopreservation following controlled ovarian stimulation is currently the fertility preservation method of choice, but breast cancer patients may have contraindications to exogenous gonadotropin administration and may not have enough time to undergo ovarian stimulation prior to chemotherapy. Fortunately, many other options are available for these women, such as the letrozole-follicle-stimulating hormone ovarian stimulation protocol, in vitro maturation of oocytes and ovarian tissue cryopreservation. In this review, we discuss the benefits and disadvantages of the different fertility preservation techniques that can be offered to breast cancer patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008df2","authors":["Hady El Hachem","Hachem HE","Atallah D","Grynberg M"],"doi":"10.2217\/fon.14.55","first_seen_on":"2014-11-21T10:00:12+00:00","issns":["1479-6694"],"issue":"10","journal":"Future Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1416905545,"links":["http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/doi\/abs\/10.2217\/fon.14.55"],"pmid":"25303056","pubdate":"2014-10-11T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Fertility preservation in breast cancer patients.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fertility-preservation-breast-cancer-patients-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4549714,"mean":5.3132757583978,"rank":2031219,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2409291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4549714,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140530,"mean":8.1409112140555,"rank":57423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":78692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140530,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":438,"mean":1.8902929061785,"rank":133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":438,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":1.8197368421053,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
