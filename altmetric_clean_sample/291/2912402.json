IL-35 functions through IL-35R and has a potent immune-suppressive activity. Although IL-35 was demonstrated to be produced by regulatory T cells, gene-expression analysis revealed that it is likely to have a wider distribution, including expression in cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrated that IL-35 is produced in human cancer tissues, such as large B cell lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and melanoma. To determine the roles of tumor-derived IL-35 in tumorigenesis and tumor immunity, we generated IL-35-producing plasmacytoma J558 and B16 melanoma cells and observed that the expression of IL-35 in cancer cells does not affect their growth and survival in vitro, but it stimulates tumorigenesis in both immune-competent and Rag1\/2-deficient mice. Tumor-derived IL-35 increases CD11b(+)Gr1(+) myeloid cell accumulation in the tumor microenvironment and, thereby, promotes tumor angiogenesis. In immune-competent mice, spontaneous CTL responses to tumors are diminished. IL-35 does not directly inhibit tumor Ag-specific CD8(+) T cell activation, differentiation, and effector functions. However, IL-35-treated cancer cells had increased expression of gp130 and reduced sensitivity to CTL destruction. Thus, our study indicates novel functions for IL-35 in promoting tumor growth via the enhancement of myeloid cell accumulation, tumor angiogenesis, and suppression of tumor immunity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Zhihui Wang","Jin-Qing Liu","Zhenzhen Liu","Rulong Shen","Guoqiang Zhang","Jianping Xu","Sujit Basu","Youmei Feng","Xue-Feng Bai","Wang Z","Liu JQ","Liu Z","Shen R","Zhang G","Xu J","Basu S","Feng Y","Bai XF"],"doi":"10.4049\/jimmunol.1202535","endpage":"2423","first_seen_on":"2014-11-21T14:13:59+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1550-6606","0022-1767"],"issue":"5","journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1416579219,"links":["http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/190\/5\/2415.full.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/190\/5\/2415.full.pdf","pmid":"23345334","pubdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2415","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Tumor-Derived IL-35 Promotes Tumor Growth by Enhancing Myeloid Cell Accumulation and Angiogenesis","type":"article","volume":"190","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tumorderived-il35-promotes-tumor-growth-enhancing-myeloid-cell-accumulation-angiogenesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4534060,"mean":5.2893790400115,"rank":2326928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1609946,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4534060,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140137,"mean":8.1136494833591,"rank":70020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":53264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140137,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6735,"mean":1.9768063558064,"rank":3031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":2118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6735,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185,"mean":2.9133369565217,"rank":117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
