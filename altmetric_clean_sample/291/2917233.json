Learning disabilities are specific and life-long but present with different school problems at different ages, depending on such factors as age, medical history, family history, and intelligence quotient. Proper individualized diagnosis and treatment plans are necessary to remediate these problems and to offer adequate coping strategies. Many children who have learning problems can be classified into one of two major categories: the dyslexia group or the nonverbal learning disability group. The role of the medical professional is important to guide parents in the diagnostic and therapeutic process.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c15","authors":["Lagae L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pcl.2008.08.001","first_seen_on":"2014-11-23T21:49:42+00:00","issns":["00313955"],"issue":"6","journal":"Pediatric clinics of North America","last_mentioned_on":1416779310,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0031395508001661","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19041456"],"pmid":"19041456","pubdate":"2008-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Learning disabilities: definitions, epidemiology, diagnosis, and intervention strategies.","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/learning-disabilities-definitions-epidemiology-diagnosis-intervention-strategies-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4883853,"mean":5.8115531674627,"rank":4085635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4883853,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163053,"mean":7.9722535510146,"rank":129149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163053,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":400,"mean":2.3702456140351,"rank":272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":400,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.87222222222222,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
