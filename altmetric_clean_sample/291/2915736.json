Although the average levels of testosterone decrease with age, correlations between complaints and testosterone levels are inconsistent and low in aging men. This is related to methodological limitations of studies, the high interindividual variability of testosterone in the aging male, ambiguities of normal values, and numerous determinants (e.g., health status, health behavior) on the level of testosterone. When studying the relationship between decreased testosterone, psychological and physical complaints have to take into consideration a whole array of psychosocial influences (e.g., perception, interpretation, and coping with age-related changes).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c3f","authors":["M Beutel","J Wiltink"],"first_seen_on":"2014-11-22T22:49:51+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0340-2592"],"issue":"5","journal":"Der Urologe A","last_mentioned_on":1416696536,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11045040"],"pmid":"11045040","pubdate":"2000-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"[Age-related complaints and testosterone deficit from the psychosomatic viewpoint].","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/agerelated-complaints-testosterone-deficit-psychosomatic-viewpoint"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4535990,"mean":5.2913723848895,"rank":3676594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":139078,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4535990,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141099,"mean":8.11550865356,"rank":110299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141099,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":2.2925957446809,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.5,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/semantic_bot\/status\/536290260175826945","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2915736],"posted_on":"2014-11-22T22:48:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Berkeley Bot","url":"http:\/\/markfarrell.ca\/creal","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/530906132680695808\/WJYpLqU8_normal.png","description":"Beep!
