In line with this, we hypothesized that the gene expression profile of histologically normal epithelium (HNEpi) could harbor certain genetic abnormalities predisposing breast tissue cells to develop human epidermal growth factor receptor\u00a02 (HER2)\u2011positive BC. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess gene expression in normal and BC tissue (BCTis) from patients with BC in order to establish its value as a potential diagnostic marker for cancer development. An array study evaluating a panel of 84\u00a0pathway\u2011 and disease\u2011specific genes in HER2\u2011positive BC and tumor\u2011adjacent HNEpi was performed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 12\u00a0patients using microdissected samples from frozen tissue. Common prognostic and predictive parameters of BC were assessed by immunohistochemistry and in\u00a0situ hybridization. In the BCTis and HNEpi samples of 12\u00a0HER2\u2011positive subjects with BC, the expression of 2,016 genes was assessed. A total of 39.3% of genes were deregulated at a minimal two\u2011fold deregulation rate and 10.7% at a five\u2011fold deregulation rate in samples of HNEpi or BCTis. Significant differences in gene expression between BCTis and HNEpi samples were revealed for BCL2L2, CD44, CTSD, EGFR, ERBB2, ITGA6, NGFB, RPL27, SCBG2A1 and SCGB1D2 genes (P<0.05), as well as GSN, KIT, KLK5, SERPINB5 and STC2 genes (P<0.01). Insignificant differences (P<0.07) were observed for CCNA1, CLU, DLC1, GABRP and\u00a0IL6 genes. The ontological gene analyses revealed that the majority of the deregulated genes in the HNEpi samples were part of the functional gene group directly associated with BC origin and prognosis. Functional analysis showed that the most frequent gene deregulations occurred in genes associated with apoptosis and cell cycle regulation in BCTis samples, and with angiogenesis, regulation of the cell cycle and transcriptional activity in HNEpi samples. The molecular profiling of HNEpi breast tissue revealed gene expression abnormalities that may represent potential markers of increased risk for HER2\u2011positive malignant transformation of breast tissue, and may be able to be employed as predictors of prognosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Zubor P","Hatok J","Moricova P","Kapustova I","Kajo K","Mendelova A","Sivonova MK","Danko J"],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2014.2863","first_seen_on":"2014-11-21T16:00:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-2997"],"issue":"","journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1416586140,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25373323"],"pmid":"25373323","pubdate":"2014-11-08T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Gene expression profiling of histologically normal breast tissue in females with human epidermal growth factor receptor\u00a02\u2011positive breast cancer.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gene-expression-profiling-histologically-normal-breast-tissue-females-human-epidermal-growth-factor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4534060,"mean":5.2893790400115,"rank":3675036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":139051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4534060,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140136,"mean":8.1137091661613,"rank":109427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140136,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1127,"mean":0.99373357015986,"rank":574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1127,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238,"mean":0.86371308016878,"rank":127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/semantic_bot\/status\/535825834150748161","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2912778],"posted_on":"2014-11-21T16:03:28+00:00","author":{"name":"Berkeley Bot","url":"http:\/\/markfarrell.ca\/creal","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/530906132680695808\/WJYpLqU8_normal.png","description":"Beep!
