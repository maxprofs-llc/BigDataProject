Two hundred and twenty five undergraduate students (113 boys & 112 girls; age 17-18 years), from four universities in Pakistan, participated with their parents. The Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (Robinson, Mandleco, Olsen, & Hart, 1995), and the Scale of Emotional Intelligence (Batool & Khalid, 2011) were completed by parents. The Aggression Questionnaire (Buss & Perry, 1992) was completed by their adolescent offspring. Mediational path analysis supported our hypothesised model. Results indicate that emotional intelligence of parents indirectly links to aggression among offspring, through parenting styles. It was concluded that emotional intelligence training will help parents to improve their parenting styles, and it will lower the risk of aggression in their children.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f6100012af","authors":["Syeda Shahida Batool","Rod Bond","Batool, Syeda Shahida","Bond, Rod"],"doi":"10.1002\/ijop.12111","endpage":"244","first_seen_on":"2014-11-21T15:22:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1464-066X","0020-7594","00207594"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1441717684,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25410534?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25410534?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ijop.12111\/abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/ijop.12111"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ijop.12111\/pdf","pmid":"25410534","pubdate":"2014-11-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"240","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Mediational role of parenting styles in emotional intelligence of parents and aggression among adolescents","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mediational-role-parenting-styles-emotional-intelligence-parents-aggression-among-adolescents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8097256,"mean":6.886408755552,"rank":3194734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4876494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8097256,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232054,"mean":7.4919997672946,"rank":69931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":160914,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232054,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":330,"mean":4.7224680851064,"rank":140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":330,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":3.0863636363636,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
