Board member Haoshen Zhou reports"],"citation":{"abstract":"The use of carbon materials as air electrodes in lithium-oxygen (Li-O2 ) batteries is known to be advantageous owing to their good conductivity and because they offer sites suitable for the reversible electrode reactions. However, the exact influence of carbon materials on the electrochemical performance of Li-O2 batteries is not clear. In this study the electrochemical performance of four different types of carbon materials (multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), CMK-3, graphene nanosheets (GNSs), and Ketjen Black (KB)) as air electrodes is examined. We find that a Li-O2 cell based on an electrode of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) demonstrates good rate performance and cycle stability, when using LiNO3 -LiTFSI\/DMSO as electrolyte. Li-O2 cells based on such MWCNT electrodes, with a cut-off capacity of 1000\u2005mA\u2009g(-1) at 500\u2005mA\u2009g(-1) , can undergo around 90\u2005cycles without obvious losses of capacity. Even when the discharge depth is increased to 2000\u2005mA\u2009h\u2009g(-1) , stable cycling is maintained for 45\u2005cycles at a charge potential below 4.0\u2005V.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e64","authors":["Yoo, Eunjoo","Zhou, Haoshen"],"doi":"10.1002\/cssc.201600177","endpage":"1254","first_seen_on":"2016-04-28T01:36:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1864-564X"],"issue":"11","journal":"ChemSusChem","last_mentioned_on":1461807376,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/cssc.201600177"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201600177\/pdf","pmid":"27120298","pubdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Energy","Materials Science","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1249","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Carbon Cathodes in Rechargeable Lithium-Oxygen Batteries Based on Double-Lithium-Salt Electrolytes","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carbon-cathodes-rechargeable-lithiumoxygen-batteries-based-doublelithiumsalt-electrolytes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7621460,"mean":6.5607387299425,"rank":6597477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7621460,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266738,"mean":11.402997319457,"rank":223530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266738,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1666,"mean":2.5872780780781,"rank":1261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1666,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":2.24276,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
