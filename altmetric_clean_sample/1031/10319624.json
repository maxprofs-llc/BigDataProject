In the present study, early, i.e., after one month, MBF and CFR are reported.\nSixty patients (45 men [75%], 55\u00b17 years) with a documented single-vessel type A or B1 lesion were included in this single-blind randomised clinical trial. Patients were randomised to implantation of a BVS or DES in a one-to-one fashion. Approximately one month after percutaneous coronary intervention, patients underwent [15O]H2O PET to assess (hyperaemic) MBF, cold pressor test MBF, and CFR. One patient refused PET perfusion at one-month follow-up (in the DES arm). MBF of the treated myocardial territory during rest, CPT, and hyperaemia were not different in BVS-treated patients as compared to DES-treated patients (1.02\u00b10.28 vs. 0.96\u00b10.24 mL\u00b7min-1\u00b7g-1, p=0.38, 1.20\u00b10.38 vs. 1.08\u00b10.23 mL\u00b7min-1\u00b7g-1, p=0.16, and 3.04\u00b10.80 vs. 3.33\u00b10.77 mL\u00b7min-1\u00b7g-1, p=0.16, respectively). CFR of the treated myocardial territory was significantly lower in the BVS-treated patients (3.09\u00b10.94 vs. 3.57\u00b10.85, p<0.05).\nNo differences in PET-derived absolute myocardial perfusion were observed between BVS-treated patients as compared to DES-treated patients at one-month follow-up. CFR was attenuated in BVS-treated patients, although still within the normal range.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccce","authors":["Wijnand J. Stuijfzand","Pieter G. Raijmakers","Roel S.
