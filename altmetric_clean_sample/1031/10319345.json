It is known that melanogenesis influences diverse cellular responses, including cell survival and apoptosis, via complex mechanisms of feedback and crosstalk. Therefore, an attempt to suppress melanin production by modulating the melanogenesis pathway may induce perturbations in the apoptotic balance of the cells in response to UVB irradiation, which results in various skin diseases such as melasma, vitiligo, and skin cancer. To identify such appropriate target strategies for the reduction of UVB-induced melanin synthesis, we reconstructed the melanogenesis signaling network and developed a Boolean network model. Mathematical simulations of the melanogenesis network model revealed that the inhibition of beta-catenin in the melanocytes effectively reduce melanin production while having minimal influence on the apoptotic balance of the cells. Exposing cells to a beta-catenin inhibitor decreased pigmentation but did not significantly change the B-cell Chronic lymphocytic leukemia\/lymphoma 2 expression, a potent regulator of apoptotic balance. Thus, our systems analysis suggests that the inhibition of beta-catenin may be the most appropriate target strategy for the reduction of UVB-induced skin pigmentation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Ho-Sung Lee","Myeong-Jin Goh","Junil Kim","Tae-Jun Choi","Hae Kwang Lee","Yong Joo Na","Kwang-Hyun Cho"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep10305","first_seen_on":"2016-08-07T22:57:49+00:00","issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1470610583,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/srep10305"],"pmid":"25980672","pubdate":"2015-05-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Computer modelling","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"10305","subjects":["science"],"title":"A systems-biological study on the identification of safe and effective molecular targets for the reduction of ultraviolet B-induced skin pigmentation","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systemsbiological-study-identification-safe-effective-molecular-targets-reduction-ultraviolet-binduc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8177609,"mean":6.9186386481167,"rank":2068197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4990186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8177609,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257543,"mean":12.00744916169,"rank":83548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":169986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257543,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34330,"mean":14.894473768534,"rank":12230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":21771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34330,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3307,"mean":16.863612825166,"rank":1136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3307,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
