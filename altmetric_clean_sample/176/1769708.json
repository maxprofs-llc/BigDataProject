Our position is that any authoritative body representing the science and profession of psychology should work solely toward the identification of empirically supported principles of change (ESPs). As challenging as it is to take this approach, a system that lists ESPs will keep a focus on issues central to the science and practice of psychology while also insulating the profession from undue entrepreneurial influences.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000239c","authors":["Gerald M.
