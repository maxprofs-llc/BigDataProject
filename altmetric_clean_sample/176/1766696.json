Total cholesterol in the treatment group was lowered from 211 mg\/dl (range 168 to 244) to 177 mg\/dl (136 to 241) (17% reduction, p = 0.003) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was reduced from 125 mg\/dl (73 to 161) to 98 mg\/dl (57 to 146) (22% reduction, p = 0.0006). LDL cholesterol reached the pre-defined cut-off level of 115 mg\/dl in 12 of 17 patients and statin dosages were reduced. In 8 of 12 patients, LDL cholesterol remained at <115 mg\/dl 6 weeks after statin reduction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd6","authors":["Anne Vorlat","Viviane M Conraads","Christiaan J Vrints"],"first_seen_on":"2013-09-19T22:37:26+00:00","issns":["1053-2498"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Heart & Lung Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1468594903,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12957617"],"pmid":"12957617","pubdate":"2003-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Regular use of margarine-containing stanol\/sterol esters reduces total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and allows reduction of statin therapy after cardiac transplantation: preliminary observations.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regular-margarinecontaining-stanolsterol-esters-reduces-total-lowdensity-lipoprotein-ldl-cholesterol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8076187,"mean":6.8570931149856,"rank":886894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7177673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8076187,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137399,"mean":7.1426887727626,"rank":16384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":120860,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137399,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":645,"mean":3.4284378881988,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":605,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":645,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.1666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Butter vs Margarine \u2013 Why I Trust Cows More Than Chemists","url":"http:\/\/authoritynutrition.com\/butter-vs-margarine\/","citation_ids":[174529,241644,1131310,765306,178658,1503454,1520252,1148081,434186,215394,1417690,225753,1994580,706776,510514,1245054,653810,754072,1572079,404261,1487362,803635,637949,1490922,1327511,1766683,1490925,1221231,1490923,130816,2549725,1766696,1766699,1766705,2549726,849762,2236924,174311,1193127,1222454,1417691,384174,198198,10374347],"posted_on":"2013-05-18T14:00:00+00:00","summary":"There is a massive amount of nutrition misinformation on the internet.\nEven the professionals themselves often say things that challenge common sense and don&#8217;t seem to have a scientific basis.\nFor example, when they tell people to replace butter with","author":{"name":"Authority Nutrition","url":"http:\/\/authoritynutrition.com","description":"An Evidence-Based Approach to Health And Nutrition"}}],"facebook":[{"title":"The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition \u2014 Error","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1793900077505844&id=1681503275412192","license":"public","citation_ids":[174529,765306,754072,849762,130816,803635,1766683,1766696,1222454],"posted_on":"2016-07-15T15:01:43+00:00","summary":"\u00bfTiene beneficios la mantequilla?\n\nLas evidencias cient\u00edficas existentes son claras y precisas: la mantequilla no es perjudicial.\n\nSe ha demostrado que el consumo de productos l\u00e1cteos ricos en grasas puede disminuir el riesgo de sufrir obesidad.\n\nAsimismo,","author":{"name":"Vivir sin Ves\u00edcula","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1681503275412192","facebook_wall_name":"Vivir sin Ves\u00edcula","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/1681503275412192\/picture","id_on_source":"1681503275412192"}}]}}
