Absence of recent thymic emigrants is also accompanied by an Omenn-like syndrome and infant death in CHD7 haploinsufficiency. Studies positively identifying recent thymic emigrants, in relation to CHD7 haploinsufficiency, are non-existent. Thirty two months of flow-cytometric work-up of an athymic (evaluated by four chest X-rays) infant, with a novel CHD7 deletion, demonstrated sparse (<50 cells\/mm(3)) but continuous egress of recent thymic emigrants (CD3(+) CD4(+) CD45RA(+) CD45RO(-) CD31(+)) and homeostatic lymphocyte expansion. Infectious or autoimmune episodes (e.g., Omenn-like syndrome) were not detected (despite lymphocyte counts <2000 cells\/\u03bcL) and excellent vaccination (tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type B and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines) and proliferation (anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulated) responses were recorded. Her CD4(+) T cells displayed Gaussian distributed TCR (CDR3) spectratypes (22 functional V\u03b2 families). Her CD4(+) T cell profile was also characterized by a slightly increased proportion CD4(+) CD25(+) FoxP3(+) T cells. Since CD3(+) CD4(+) CD45RA(+) CD45RO(-) CD31(+) RTE are reported to be TCR diverse and to contain regulatory T cells, we found it important to report that continuously reduced numbers of CD3(+) CD4(+) CD45RA(+) CD45RO(-) CD31(+) RTE, in the context of CHD7 haploinsufficiency and despite severe lymphopenia, is consistent with an uneventful clinical outcome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002a0e","authors":["Kristian Assing","Christian Nielsen","Maria Kirchhoff","Hans O.
