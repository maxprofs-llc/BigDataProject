In some instances, however, acute onset of neurological symptoms has been reported but the pathogenetic mechanism and subsequent clinical course have not been explained. In those cases, it was reported that urgent treatment of foramen magnum decompression (FMD) was very effective. This work reports that an 11-year-old girl with CM-I subacutely developed unique symptoms and that urgent treatment of FMD was very effective.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5373cf058f61000462c","authors":["Oishi"],"doi":"10.4103\/2152-7806.113355","first_seen_on":"2013-09-19T12:18:18+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Surgical Neurology International","last_mentioned_on":1371321909,"links":["http:\/\/www.surgicalneurologyint.com\/article.asp?issn=2152-7806;year=2013;volume=4;issue=1;spage=79;epage=79;aulast=Oishi"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.surgicalneurologyint.com\/article.asp?issn=2152-7806;year=2013;volume=4;issue=1;spage=79;epage=79;aulast=Oishi;type=2","pmid":"23869279","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Rapidly progressing monoparesis caused by Chiari malformation type I without syringomyelia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rapidly-progressing-monoparesis-caused-chiari-malformation-type-i-without-syringomyelia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229091,"mean":5.9655632456766,"rank":2549371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3542967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229091,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108418,"mean":7.9355242812475,"rank":44990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":60069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108418,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":374,"mean":6.6914155495979,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":374,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":4.7625,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
