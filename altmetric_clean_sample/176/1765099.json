We have previously reported that miR-140 plays an important role during palatal cartilage development by modulating platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (pdgfra) in zebrafish. However, the regulatory mechanism of miR-140 in cartilage is still unknown. Using developing zebrafish, sox9a mutant (sox9a-\/-) and sox9b mutant (sox9b-\/-) zebrafish and SOX9 small interfering RNA in human chondrocytes, T\/C-28 cells, we found that miR-140 is regulated by the cartilage master transcription regulator Sox9 in zebrafish and mammalian cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a88","authors":["Yukio Nakamura","Xinjun He","Hiroyuki Kato","Shigeyuki Wakitani","Tatsuya Kobayashi","Sumiko Watanabe","Atsumi Iida","Hideaki Tahara","Matthew L.
