Although previous frequency tuning measurements of cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials have provided important information for a clinical application, those of oVEMPs have rarely been studied. We explored the frequency tuning properties of oVEMPs in 12 healthy participants. Our results indicate that the best frequencies of the oVEMPs to air-conducted sound and bone-conducted vibration are 500 and 250 Hz, respectively. The difference in the best frequencies between the two stimuli may originate from the difference in the end organs (saccule or utricle), preferentially activated by each stimulus.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082af","doi":"10.1097\/wnr.0b013e3283329b4a","first_seen_on":"2013-09-19T14:36:18+00:00","issns":["0959-4965"],"issue":"16","journal":"NeuroReport","last_mentioned_on":1379526350,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/neuroreport\/Abstract\/2009\/10280\/Frequency_tuning_properties_of_ocular_vestibular.19.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/neuroreport\/2009\/10280\/Frequency_tuning_properties_of_ocular_vestibular.19.pdf","pmid":"19809372","pubdate":"2009-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1491","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Frequency tuning properties of ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/frequency-tuning-properties-ocular-vestibular-evoked-myogenic-potentials-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3068739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":945739,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97738,"mean":7.7409742267516,"rank":66276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":19706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97738,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1282,"mean":2.8892146760343,"rank":758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1282,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":2.4869230769231,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
