This study aimed at characterizing left ventricular diastolic function in normotensive offspring of hypertensive Nigerians. Sixty-five offspring of hypertensive parents aged 15-25 years (subjects) with 65-age and sex-matched offspring of normotensive parents (controls) were studied for early makers of hypertensive cardiovascular disease using Doppler echocardiogram. Mean mitral E velocity was reduced (P = 0.01) in the subjects (73.3 \u00b1 12.6\u2009cm\/s) compared with the controls (80.2 \u00b1 22.5\u2009cm\/s). Similarly, mean S velocity of pulmonary venous flow was lower (P = 0.01) in the subjects than in the controls. Left atrial dimension and mitral E\/A ratio in the subjects with left ventricular hypertrophy were higher (P = 0.002, 0.004 respectively) than in the subjects without this abnormality. We concluded that normotensive offspring of hypertensive Nigerians showed early alterations in indexes of left ventricular diastolic filling and these abnormalities were exaggerated in the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a9d","authors":["Kolo, P.
