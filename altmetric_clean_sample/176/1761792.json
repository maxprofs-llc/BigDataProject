Patients (n = 32) were enrolled postsurgically. Nonauditory side effects were evaluated at fitting and audiological performance was determined using the Sound Effects Recognition Test (SERT), Monosyllable-Trochee-Polysyllable (MTP) test and open-set sentence tests. Subjective benefits were determined by questionnaire. ABI activation was documented in 27 patients, 2 patients were too ill for testing and 3 patients were without any auditory perception. SERT and MTP outcomes under auditory-only conditions improved significantly between first fitting and 12-month follow-up. Open-set sentence recognition improved from 5% at first fitting to 37% after 12 months. The number of active electrodes had no significant effect on performance. All questionnaire respondents were 'satisfied' to 'very satisfied' with their ABI. An ABI is an effective treatment option in NF2 patients with the potential to provide open-set speech recognition and subjective benefits. To our knowledge, the data presented herein is exceptional in terms of the open-set speech perception achieved in NF2 patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f61000326a","authors":["Cordula Matthies","Stefan Brill","Kimitaka Kaga","Akio Morita","Kozo Kumakawa","Henryk Skarzynski","Andre Claassen","Yau Hui","Charlotte Chiong","Joachim M\u00fcller","Robert Behr"],"doi":"10.1159\/000350568","first_seen_on":"2013-09-19T10:43:03+00:00","issns":["1423-0275"],"issue":"5","journal":"ORL","last_mentioned_on":1379587314,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24042846"],"pmid":"24042846","pubdate":"2013-09-10T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Auditory Brainstem Implantation Improves Speech Recognition in Neurofibromatosis Type II Patients.","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/auditory-brainstem-implantation-improves-speech-recognition-neurofibromatosis-type-ii-patients-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3068752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":945740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97737,"mean":7.7410595686341,"rank":66277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":19706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97737,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":1.4117346938776,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.86666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Nf2UK\/status\/380642902050746368","license":"public","citation_ids":[1761792],"posted_on":"2013-09-19T10:41:54+00:00","author":{"name":"NF2UK","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3288209644\/aa216812edf943737a3a3a202bdabf23_normal.jpeg","description":"For people in UK affected by Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) - for info about Nf2: http:\/\/www.nhs.uk\/Conditions\/neurofibromatosis-type-2\/Pages\/Introduction.aspx","id_on_source":"Nf2UK","tweeter_id":"1156765418","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":176},"tweet_id":"380642902050746368"}]}}
