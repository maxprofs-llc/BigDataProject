The gravitropic response of peanut gynophores plays an essential role in peanut reproductive development. In this study, we developed an in vitro culture system and applied it to the study of peanut gynophore gravitropism. By comparing the proteomes of gynophores grown in vitro with the tip pointing upward (gravity stimulation sample) and downward (natural growth control) at 6h and 12h, we observed 42 and 39 with significantly altered expression pattern at 6 and 12h, respectively. Out of these proteins, 13 proteins showed same expression profiling at both 6h and 12h. They were identified by MALDI-TOF\/TOF and further characterized with quantitative real time RT-PCR. Among the 13 identified proteins, two were identified as class III acidic endochitinases, two were identified as Kunitz trypsin protease inhibitors, and the remaining proteins were identified as pathogenesis-related class 10 protein, Ara h 8 allergen isoform 3, voltage-dependent anion channel, gamma carbonic anhydrase 1, germin-like protein subfamily 3 member 3 precursor, chloride channel, glycine-rich RNA-binding protein and gibberellin receptor GID1. Real time RT-PCR analysis revealed that transcriptional regulation is consistent with expression at the protein level for class III acidic endochitinase, Kunitz trypsin protease inhibitor, chloride channel and pathogenesis-related class 10 protein, while the expression of the other 7 proteins might be regulated at post-transcriptional levels. This study identified several potential gravitropic response proteins in peanut gynophores and helps to understand early gravitropic responses in peanut gynophores.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ee4","authors":["Hai-Fen Li","Fang-He Zhu","He-Ying Li","Wei Zhu","Xiao-Ping Chen","Yan-Bin Hong","Hai-Yan Liu","Hong Wu","Xuan-Qiang Liang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jprot.2013.08.006","first_seen_on":"2013-09-19T14:58:24+00:00","issns":["18743919"],"journal":"Journal of Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1377681640,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1874391913004466"],"pmid":"23994445","pubdate":"2013-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Proteomic identification of gravitropic response genes in peanut gynophores","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proteomic-identification-gravitropic-response-genes-peanut-gynophores"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619417,"mean":4.9286052998637,"rank":2903876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619417,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91473,"mean":7.6850434012595,"rank":73004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91473,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":889,"mean":1.7563108108108,"rank":420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":889,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":1.0244646464646,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
