From 1 March to 30 June 2017, 203 measles cases were laboratory-confirmed (108 sporadic cases and 95 related to 47 clusters). Phylogenetic analysis revealed the co-circulation of two different genotypes, D8 and B3. Both genotypes caused nosocomial clusters in two hospitals. The rapid analysis of epidemiological and phylogenetic data allowed effective surveillance and tracking of transmission pathways.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000738e","authors":["Amendola, Antonella","Bianchi, Silvia","Frati, Elena R","Ciceri, Giulia","Faccini, Marino","Senatore, Sabrina","Colzani, Daniela","Lamberti, Anna","Baggieri, Melissa","Cereda, Danilo","Gramegna, Maria","Nicoletti, Loredana","Magurano, Fabio","Tanzi, Elisabetta"],"doi":"10.2807\/1560-7917.es.2017.22.33.30596","first_seen_on":"2017-08-26T12:22:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1025-496X","1560-7917"],"issue":"33","journal":"Eurosurveillance","last_mentioned_on":1503744725,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28840825?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28840825","pubdate":"2017-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC)","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Ongoing large measles outbreak with nosocomial transmission in Milan, northern Italy, March\u2013August 2017","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ongoing-large-measles-outbreak-nosocomial-transmission-milan-northern-italy-marchaugust-2017"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":7284471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169794,"mean":12.650422761834,"rank":138979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169794,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":694,"mean":5.2531082251082,"rank":593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":694,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.1464285714286,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/phy_papers\/statuses\/901396828507193344","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24348684],"posted_on":"2017-08-26T10:52:05+00:00","author":{"name":"phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/438115152294989824\/0M7ZG0xC_normal.jpeg","description":"Continuous feed for phylogenetics papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
