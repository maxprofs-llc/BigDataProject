The big challenge is to integrate the information from this specialty as well as those of biochemistry, physiology, behavior, and anatomy to explain how fundamental biological processes really work. Sleep, the circadian clock and development all qualify as overarching processes that encompass levels from molecule to behavior as part of their known mechanisms. They overlap each other, such that understanding the mechanisms of one can lead to insights into one of the others. In this essay, we consider how the experimental approaches and findings relating to Caenorhabditis elegans development and lethargus on one hand, and to the circadian clock and sleep in higher organisms on the other, could complement and enhance one another.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9243cf058f61000db97","authors":["M.
