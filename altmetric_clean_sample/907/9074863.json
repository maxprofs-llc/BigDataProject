Imaging studies have emphasised the overlap between infant and adult brain connectome architecture, but electrophysiological analysis of infant brain nociceptive networks can provide further understanding of the functional postnatal development of pain perception. Here we hypothesise that the human infant brain encodes noxious information with different neuronal patterns compared to adults. To test this we compared EEG responses to the same time-locked noxious skin lance in infants aged 0-19 days (n\u2009=\u200918, clinically required) and adults aged 23-48 years (n\u2009=\u200921). Time-frequency analysis revealed that while some features of adult nociceptive network activity are present in infants at longer latencies, including beta-gamma oscillations, infants display a distinct, long latency, noxious evoked 18-fold energy increase in the fast delta band (2-4\u2009Hz) that is absent in adults. The differences in activity between infants and adults have a widespread topographic distribution across the brain. These data support our hypothesis and indicate important postnatal changes in the encoding of mechanical pain in the human brain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Lorenzo Fabrizi","Madeleine Verriotis","Gemma Williams","Amy Lee","Judith Meek","Sofia Olhede","Maria Fitzgerald"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep28642","first_seen_on":"2016-06-27T12:58:57+00:00","funders":["niehs","mrc"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1467119948,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep28642"],"pmcid":"PMC4921818","pmid":"27345331","pubdate":"2016-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neural patterning","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Sensory processing","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Cortex","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Paediatric research","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"28642","subjects":["science"],"title":"Encoding of mechanical nociception differs in the adult and infant brain","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/encoding-mechanical-nociception-differs-adult-infant-brain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7958342,"mean":6.7226589717569,"rank":3945815,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3809507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7958342,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261477,"mean":11.525768246416,"rank":130181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":120692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261477,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32108,"mean":14.865103933722,"rank":17260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":13396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32108,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3326,"mean":16.56009443609,"rank":1703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3326,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
