However, a subset of CRC, characterized by mismatch deficiency or microsatellite instability high (MSI-high), has shown robust early signals of antitumor activity with PD1 targeting. It is now clear that MSI-high CRC represents a unique molecular and immunological tumor subset. Further study and understanding of the immunological microenvironment of these tumors will be critical to continued success with immune-based approaches in MSI-high CRC. This review discusses the current biological understanding of MSI-high CRC and outlines the current and ongoing clinical trials investigating immunotherapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057c7","authors":["Link, James T","Overman, Michael James","Link, James T.","James T.
