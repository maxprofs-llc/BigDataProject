Otherwise, after 25 years, laparoscopy became \"traditional\" and other minimally invasive techniques continue to be developed but their indications deserve further investigation. Less aggressive treatment in non-complicated diverticulitis becomes more popular, and even antibiotic treatment has been challenged by a randomized study. In colorectal oncology, local resection or observation only seems to become a valuable approach in selected patients with complete response after neo adjuvant chemoradiation. Finally, enhanced recovery pathways (ERAS) have been validated and is increasingly accepted for colorectal surgery and ERAS principles are successfully applied in other surgical fields.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd1b","authors":["Roulin D","H\u00fcbner M","Demartines N"],"first_seen_on":"2013-03-31T03:36:36+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"369","journal":"Revue m\u00e9dicale suisse","last_mentioned_on":1364570881,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23409643?dopt=Citation"],"pmid":"23409643","pubdate":"2013-02-17T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Surgery].","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/surgery-382"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634360,"mean":4.9196455088828,"rank":2897856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":82249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634360,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85347,"mean":6.3958892976825,"rank":65571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85347,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154,"mean":0.94052287581699,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.78888888888889,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
