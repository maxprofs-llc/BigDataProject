The aim of the present study was to investigate the beneficial effect of hyperinsulinemia during HD on bioactive IGF-I and inflammatory biomarkers. METHODS: In a randomized cross-over study, 11 non-diabetic HD patients received a standardised HD session with either: 1) no treatment, 2) glucose infusion (10% glucose, 2.5 mL\/kg\/h), or 3) glucose-insulin infusion (10% glucose added 30 IU NovoRapid(R) per litre, 2.5 mL\/kg\/h). Each experiment consisted of three periods: pre-HD (-120 to 0 min), HD (0 to 240 min), and post-HD (240 to 360 min). A meal was served at baseline (-120 min); infusions were administered from baseline to 240 min. The primary outcome was change in bioactive IGF-I during the experiment. Secondary outcomes were changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Comparisons were performed using mixed-model analysis of variance for repeated measures. RESULTS: From baseline to the end of study, no significant differences were observed in the changes in either serum bioactive IGF-I or total IGF-I between study days. Overall, serum bioactive IGF-I levels rose above baseline at 120 to 300 min with a maximum increase of 20% at 120 min (95% confidence interval (CI), 9 to 31%; p < 0.001), whereas total IGF-I levels rose above baseline at 180 to 300 min with a maximum increase of 5% at 240 min (95% CI, 2 to 9%; p = 0.004). A significant difference was observed in the changes in serum IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) between study days (p = 0.008), but differences were only significant in the post-HD period. From baseline to the end of HD, no significant difference was observed in the changes in serum IGFBP-1 levels between study days, and in this time period overall serum IGFBP-1 levels were below baseline at all time points with a maximum decrease of 51% at 180 min (95% CI, 45 to 57%; p < 0.001). None of the investigated inflammatory biomarkers showed any differences in the changes over time between study days. CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial insulin secretion stimulated the IGF-system during HD with no further effect of adding glucose or glucose-insulin infusion. Hyperinsulinemia during HD had no effect on biomarkers of inflammation.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov registry: NCT01209403.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007cb","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2369-14-80","first_seen_on":"2013-04-04T23:48:12+00:00","issns":["1471-2369"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Nephrology","last_mentioned_on":1365119270,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2369\/14\/80\/abstract"],"pmid":"23557110","pubdate":"2013-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"80","subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Effect of hyperinsulinemia during hemodialysis on the insulin-like growth factor system and inflammatory biomarkers: a randomized open-label crossover study","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-hyperinsulinemia-during-hemodialysis-insulinlike-growth-factor-system-inflammatory-biomarkers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":1928840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3067154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93445,"mean":6.8773580540218,"rank":29602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":62903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93445,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":730,"mean":2.236743484225,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":730,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":2.2339285714286,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
