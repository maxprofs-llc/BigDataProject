In particular, there is an unresolved question about whether or not it is a manifestation of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). There are some definite similarities between 'compulsive' hoarding and OCD, but they are outweighed by the differences between them. It is proposed that the matter can be clarified by separating hoarding from OCD, and that this would advance clinical work and research.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023ab","authors":["Rachman S","Elliott CM","Shafran R","Radomsky AS","S.
