The technological advances have opened new windows into genomics beyond the DNA sequence. In parallel, clinical practice generate large amounts of data. This represents an underused data source that has much greater potential in translational research than is currently realized. This research aims at implementing a translational medicine informatics platform to integrate clinical data (disease diagnosis, diseases activity and treatment) of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients from Karolinska University Hospital and their research database (biobanks, genotype variants and serology) at the Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000865","doi":"10.1186\/1479-5876-11-85","first_seen_on":"2013-04-01T23:24:51+00:00","issns":["1479-5876"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Translational Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1364858539,"links":["http:\/\/www.translational-medicine.com\/content\/11\/1\/85\/abstract"],"pmid":"23548156","pubdate":"2013-04-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"85","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Implementation of the CDC translational informatics platform - from genetic variants to the national Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/implementation-cdc-translational-informatics-platformfrom-genetic-variants-national-swedish-rheumato"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":1990020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2420142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89669,"mean":6.6669214658519,"rank":36238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":50881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89669,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1265,"mean":2.6739794303797,"rank":376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1265,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":3.6993913043478,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
