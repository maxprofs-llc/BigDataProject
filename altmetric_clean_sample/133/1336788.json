In addition to modified LDL, free cholesterol (FC) is thought to play an important role in the development of endothelial dysfunction, although the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction induced by an FC-rich environment. Loading cultured human aortic endothelial cells with FC induced the formation of vesicular structures composed of FC-rich membranes. Raft proteins such as phospho-caveolin-1 (Tyr-14) and small GTPase Rac were accumulated toward FC-rich membranes around vesicular structures. In the presence of these vesicles, angiotensin II-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was considerably enhanced. This ROS shifted endothelial NOS (eNOS) toward vesicle membranes and vesicles with a FC-rich domain trafficked toward perinuclear late endosomes\/lysosomes, which resulted in the deterioration of eNOS Ser-1177 phosphorylation and NO production. Angiotensin II-induced ROS decreased the bioavailability of eNOS under the FC-enriched condition.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Eisuke Amiya","Masafumi Watanabe","Norihiko Takeda","Tetsuya Saito","Taro Shiga","Yumiko Hosoya","Tomoko Nakao","Yasushi Imai","Ichiro Manabe","Ryozo Nagai","Issei Komuro","Koji Maemura"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m112.448522","first_seen_on":"2013-04-03T19:33:43+00:00","issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1365017462,"links":["http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/early\/2013\/04\/02\/jbc.M112.448522.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/early\/2013\/04\/02\/jbc.M112.448522.full.pdf","pmid":"23548909","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Angiotensin II Impairs Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Bioavailability under Free Cholesterol-Enriched Conditions via Intracellular Free Cholesterol-rich Membrane Mircodomains","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/angiotensin-ii-impairs-endothelial-nitricoxide-synthase-bioavailability-under-free-cholesterolenrich"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3077695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":956478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89281,"mean":6.703734498208,"rank":60166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":18810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89281,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30238,"mean":2.4916665674505,"rank":23364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":5582,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30238,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":1.8298076923077,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
