Unoprostone is known to have neuroprotective effects and to activate large conductance Ca\u00b2\u207a-activated K\u207a (BK) channels. Recently, unoprostone has been tested in clinical studies as a therapeutic agent for retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and studies have demonstrated an improvement in retinal sensitivity and in the protection of central retinal sensitivity with its use. However, the mechanism of action underlying unoprostone's protective effect in RP is not fully known. It is well known that the pathogenesis of RP can be accelerated by oxidative stress or light irradiation. Therefore, the current study investigated the effects and the underlying mechanism of action of unoprostone on oxidative stress- and light irradiation-induced damage in photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelial cultures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ec8","authors":["Kazuhiro Tsuruma","Yuka Tanaka","Masamitsu Shimazawa","Yukihiko Mashima","Hideaki Hara"],"first_seen_on":"2013-04-01T00:00:32+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Molecular Vision","last_mentioned_on":1364774618,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3250378\/"],"pmid":"22219651","pubdate":"2013-04-01T20:11:00+00:00","publisher":"Emory University","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"3556","title":"Unoprostone reduces oxidative stress- and light-induced retinal cell death, and phagocytotic dysfunction, by activating BK channels","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unoprostone-reduces-oxidative-stress-lightinduced-retinal-cell-death-phagocytotic-dysfunction-activa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616992,"mean":4.9289391557822,"rank":2015392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":924712,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616992,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85429,"mean":6.4295684787189,"rank":43579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":26446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85429,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":380,"mean":1.6410606860158,"rank":167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":380,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
