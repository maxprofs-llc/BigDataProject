Using data from a 2006 survey of 1,680 women and their dyadic interactions, we compare the composition of personal networks, HIV\/AIDS communication, and preventive behavior of women married to migrants and those married to non-migrants. Results show that migrants' wives were more likely than non-migrants' wives to have other migrants' wives as personal network members, to engage in HIV\/AIDS communication, and to discuss HIV prevention. However, they were no more likely to talk about HIV\/AIDS with migrants' wives than with non-migrants' wives. They were also no more likely to talk about AIDS and its prevention than non-migrants' wives who express worry about HIV infection from their spouses. Finally, we detect that network members' prevention behavior was similar to respondents', although this did not depend on migration. We contextualize these findings within the literature and discuss their policy implications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f6100078a4","authors":["Avogo W","Agadjanian V"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijerph10030892","first_seen_on":"2013-04-01T19:13:23+00:00","issns":["1661-7827"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1376578875,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23466827","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3709293\/?report=classic"],"pmid":"23466827","pubdate":"2013-03-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"MDPI AG (Postfach, Basel CH-4005, Switzerland)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Men\u2019s Migration, Women\u2019s Personal Networks, and Responses to HIV\/AIDS in Mozambique","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mens-migration-womens-personal-networks-responses-hivaids-mozambique"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":3351165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1480956,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94042,"mean":6.835316000468,"rank":58547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":31195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94042,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1762,"mean":7.0715525269733,"rank":1250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1762,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":4.3083333333333,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
