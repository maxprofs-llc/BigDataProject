It is argued that since the dental clinician's caries-related decision making is a script-matching enterprise in which clinical decisions are made on the basis of 'this-lesion-needs-this-kind-of-treatment' reasoning, the methods and strategies employed for caries lesion detection should accommodate this fact. This may be done by employing a clinical visual-tactile method for caries lesion detection that evaluates the two aspects that are crucial for appropriate caries management: lesion activity and surface integrity. The use of diagnostic methods that do not assess these features directly but involve assumptions about activity status and surface integrity should be avoided. This includes the use of bite-wing radiography for the detection of approximal caries lesions, as it may be shown that plain reliance on radiographs leads to considerable overtreatment. If clinical dentistry is to retain its status as a profession committed to doing good, changes in diagnostic practices along these lines are warranted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000215b","authors":["Baelum V"],"doi":"10.3109\/00016350903530786","first_seen_on":"2013-04-01T23:13:59+00:00","issns":["0001-6357"],"issue":"2","journal":"Acta Odontologica Scandinavica","last_mentioned_on":1364857893,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20141362"],"pmid":"20141362","pubdate":"2010-02-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"What is an appropriate caries diagnosis?","type":"article","volume":"68","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/appropriate-caries-diagnosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3077790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":956625,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89670,"mean":6.6680091670478,"rank":60338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":18989,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89670,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184,"mean":2.1573551912568,"rank":121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.81666666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
