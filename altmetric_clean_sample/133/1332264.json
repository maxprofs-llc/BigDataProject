One orphanage received training plus structural changes, another training only, and a third business as usual. The intervention produced substantial differences between these institutions on the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) Inventory and on the Battelle Developmental Inventory scores for children. These institutional differences in HOME scores (N\u00a0=\u00a0298) and Battelle scores for children (N\u00a0=\u00a0357) departing the institutions for families in St. Petersburg and the United States were maintained for at least 6\u00a0years after the intervention project. This result may be associated with certain features of the intervention and activities conducted during the follow-up interval.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4c93cf058f61000013c","authors":["McCall, Robert B.","Groark, Christina J.","Fish, Larry","Muhamedrahimov, Rifkat J.","Palmov, Oleg I.","Nikiforova, Natalia V."],"doi":"10.1111\/cdev.12098","endpage":"1749","first_seen_on":"2013-04-02T00:56:24+00:00","issns":["1467-8624","0009-3920"],"issue":"5","journal":"Child Development","last_mentioned_on":1364864029,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cdev.12098\/abstract;jsessionid=712D192D81E9BADBEFEE714DA0EDD21C.d01t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cdev.12098\/pdf","pmid":"23551051","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1734","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Maintaining a Social\u00e2\u0080\u0090Emotional Intervention and Its Benefits for Institutionalized Children","type":"article","volume":"84","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/maintaining-socialemotional-intervention-benefits-institutionalized-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6512878,"mean":6.0323791246155,"rank":4816384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":957277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6512878,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100542,"mean":6.8842281059469,"rank":67268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":18827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100542,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1568,"mean":12.169206126356,"rank":1397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1568,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":14.24,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
