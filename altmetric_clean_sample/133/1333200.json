Beginning with a highly inbred populations of Drosophila melanogaster, new mutations that accumulated in experiments of two females and two males or of one female and one male each generation for 52 generations did not cause a decline in progeny numbers over time. Only two lines went extinct among 52 tested lines. In three of four experiments there was a significant increase in progeny numbers over time (mutational firm up), which had to be due to new beneficial, compensatory, overdominant, or back mutations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f610007521","doi":"10.1007\/s10709-013-9716-7","first_seen_on":"2013-04-02T10:24:22+00:00","issns":["1573-6857"],"journal":"Genetica","last_mentioned_on":1364898111,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23543206?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23543206","pubdate":"2013-03-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"An extreme test of mutational meltdown shows mutational firm up instead.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extreme-test-mutational-meltdown-shows-mutational-firm-up-instead"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632140,"mean":4.9249633348334,"rank":2898366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632140,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85525,"mean":6.4234852439083,"rank":65851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85525,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244,"mean":2.4219423868313,"rank":199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
