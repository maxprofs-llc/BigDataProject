The study included 81 children and adolescents with T1DM and 19 control subjects. All study participants had biochemical parameters examined, underwent an eye examination, and 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. Moreover, serum concentrations of TGF- \u03b2 1 were measured. The group of patients with T1DM and nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) had statistically significant higher serum levels of TGF- \u03b2 1 (P = 0.001) as compared to T1DM patients without retinopathy as well as the healthy control subject. The threshold serum TGF- \u03b2 1 concentrations which had a discriminative ability to predict the presence of DR were calculated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis and amounted to 443\u2009pg\/ml. The area under the ROC curve (AUCROC) was 0.80, and its population value was in the range of 0.66 to 0.94. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated to be 72% and 88%, respectively. Our results suggest that TGF- \u03b2 1 serum concentrations may be an additional parameter in predicting the occurrence of DR in juvenile patients with T1DM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56b367f82a83eea9718b4799","authors":["Raczy&#x144;ska, Krystyna"],"doi":"10.1155\/2013\/614908","first_seen_on":"2013-03-31T17:40:09+00:00","issns":["2314-6745"],"journal":"Journal of Diabetes Research","last_mentioned_on":1364751464,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/jdr\/2013\/614908\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/jdr\/2013\/614908.pdf","pmid":"23671881","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Serum Concentrations of Transforming Growth Factor-Beta 1 in Predicting the Occurrence of Diabetic Retinopathy in Juvenile Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serum-concentrations-transforming-growth-factorbeta-1-predicting-occurrence-diabetic-retinopathy-juv-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4712939,"mean":5.6861802366192,"rank":3947296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4712939,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91076,"mean":6.8602710513314,"rank":74685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91076,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
