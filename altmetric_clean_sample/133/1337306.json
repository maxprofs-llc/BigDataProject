One potential intervention is administering brief simulations of auditory hallucinations, but no empirical evaluations have been published. This research examined the efficacy of a brief simulation on stigma across two listening conditions. After completing a stigma measure, participants (N = 127) listened to a simulation and were randomly assigned to one of two listening conditions: (1) sitting in a research lab, or (2) ambulating around a college campus completing two tasks. All participants then completed the stigma measure a second time. Regardless of listening condition, the simulations led to changes on two aspects of stigma--less willingness to help\/interact and stronger attitudes for forcing treatment on those with mental illness. These findings suggest that brief simulations require additional careful evaluation of their efficacy prior to wide implementation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100025b1","authors":["Seth A.
