Family Medicine residents are not routinely trained to manage miscarriages using MVA, but have the potential to increase access to this procedure. This process evaluation sought to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of office-based MVA for miscarriage in Family Medicine residency sites in Washington State.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bb","authors":["Blair G Darney","Marcia R Weaver","Deborah VanDerhei","Nancy G Stevens","Sarah W Prager"],"doi":"10.1186\/1472-6963-13-123","first_seen_on":"2013-04-04T08:25:56+00:00","issns":["1472-6963",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Health Services Research","last_mentioned_on":1365066740,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/13\/123\/abstract"],"pmid":"23552274","pubdate":"2013-04-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"123","subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"\u201cOne of those areas that people avoid\u201d a qualitative study of implementation in miscarriage management","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/one-those-areas-people-avoid-qualitative-study-implementation-miscarriage-management"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4685520,"mean":5.7047663415748,"rank":2492989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1554802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4685520,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90414,"mean":6.9602168714676,"rank":44759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":33935,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90414,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2156,"mean":4.446962412993,"rank":1399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2156,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":5.1161978021978,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
