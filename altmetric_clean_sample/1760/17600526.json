The average source level for these calls was 144 dBRMS re 1\u2009\u03bcPa at 1\u2009m in the 40-500\u2009Hz frequency band. Source level estimates ranged from 129 to 149 dBRMS re 1\u2009\u03bcPa. Four call parameters, including minimum frequency, peak frequency, total duration, and pulse duration, were also measured. These measurements indicated that breeding vocalizations of harbor seals near the Beardslee Islands of Glacier Bay National Park are similar in duration (average total duration: 4.8\u2009s, average pulse duration: 3.0\u2009s) to previously reported values from other populations, but are 170-220\u2009Hz lower in average minimum frequency (78\u2009Hz).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040f2","authors":["Leanna P.
