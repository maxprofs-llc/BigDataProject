A comparable group of 35 women with identical cardiovascular risk factors was included as the control group. All women were instructed to participate in a best management plan of menopause.\nThe two groups were comparable. All women completed the eight weeks study. Only minor deviations from the best management plan were observed. At inclusion, both groups were similar in respect to risk factors. Supplementation with Pycnogenol\u00ae decreased the slightly elevated cholesterol and triglycerides after 8 weeks (P<0.05). Also the fasting glucose levels were normalized (P<0.05). The borderline increased blood pressure was reduced to normal values at 8 weeks (P<0.05). Plasma free radicals dropped significantly by 22% (P<0.05). Homocysteine and CRP levels decreased sharply by 43% and 60%, respectively (P<0.05). No significant changes of these risk factors were noted in the control group. Almost all menopausal symptoms, scored by The Menopausal Symptoms Questionnaire 34, improved significantly following supplementation with Pycnogenol\u00ae. The supplementation was well tolerated.\nThe supplementation with Pycnogenol\u00ae improved the quality of life of perimenopausal women and normalized a series of cardiovascular risk factors, especially factors connected to cardiovascular events, as homocysteine and CRP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081b2","authors":["Luzzi, Roberta","Belcaro, Gianni","Hosoi, Morio","Feragalli, Beatrice","Cornelli, Umberto","Dugall, Mark","Ledda, Andrea"],"doi":"10.23736\/s0026-4784.16.03913-7","first_seen_on":"2017-03-17T10:42:09+00:00","issns":["1827-1650"],"issue":"1","journal":"Minerva Ginecologica","last_mentioned_on":1490033038,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28116886","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.23736\/S0026-4784.16.03913-7"],"pmid":"28116886","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gynecology"],"title":"Normalization of cardiovascular risk factors in peri-menopausal women with Pycnogenol\u00ae.","type":"article","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/normalization-cardiovascular-risk-factors-perimenopausal-women-pycnogenol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.75,"score_history":{"1y":9.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":906701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7476321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266324,"mean":13.115701903327,"rank":45377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":220574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266324,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141,"mean":2.4070142857143,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.95,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FI":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JuhanaHarju\/statuses\/842687436094365697","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17606041],"posted_on":"2017-03-17T10:41:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Juhana Harju","url":"http:\/\/suomenterveysravinto.fi\/blogi\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/476462112076611584\/7hbqBECy_normal.jpeg","description":"Nutrition expert at a Finnish company.
