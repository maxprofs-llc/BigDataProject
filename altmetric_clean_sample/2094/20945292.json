Here, the roles and mechanisms of A20 (TNFAIP3), an important endogenous anti-inflammatory factor, are examined in ICH. A20 expression in the PBMCs of ICH patients and an ICH mouse model was detected, and the correlation between A20 expression and neurologic deficits was analyzed. A20 expression was increased in PBMCs and was negatively related to the modified Rankin Scale score. A20 expression was also increased in mouse perihematomal tissues. A20(-\/-) and A20-overexpressing mice were generated to further analyze A20 function. Compared with wild-type (WT) mice, A20(-\/-) and A20-overexpressing mice showed significant increases and decreases, respectively, in hematoma volume, neurologic deficit score, mortality, neuronal degeneration, and proinflammatory factors. Moreover, WT-A20(-\/-) parabiosis was established to explore the role of A20 in peripheral blood in ICH injury. ICH-induced damage, including brain edema, neurologic deficit score, proinflammatory factors, and neuronal apoptosis, was reduced in A20(-\/-) parabionts compared with A20(-\/-) mice. Finally, the interactions between TRAF6 and Ubc13 and UbcH5c were increased in A20(-\/-) mice compared with WT mice; the opposite occurred in A20-overexpressing mice. Enhanced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and NF-\u03baB activation were observed in A20(-\/-) mice, but the results were reversed in A20-overexpressing mice. These results suggested that A20 is involved in regulating ICH-induced inflammatory injury in both the central and peripheral system and that A20 reduces ICH-induced inflammation by regulating TRAF6 polyubiquitination. Targeting A20 may thus be a promising therapeutic strategy for ICH.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Meng, Zhaoyou","Zhao, Ting","Zhou, Kai","Zhong, Qi","Wang, Yanchun","Xiong, Xiaoyi","Wang, Faxiang","Yang, Yuanrui","Zhu, Wenyao","Liu, Juan","Liao, Maofan","Wu, Lirong","Duan, Chunmei","Li, Jie","Gong, Qiuwen","Liu, Liang","Xiong, Ao","Yang, Meihua","Wang, Jian","Yang, Qingwu"],"doi":"10.4049\/jimmunol.1600334","first_seen_on":"2017-06-10T14:33:54+00:00","issns":["0022-1767","1550-6606"],"journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1497105225,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27986908"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/jimmunol\/198\/2\/820.full.pdf","pmid":"27986908","pubdate":"2017-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The American Association of Immunologists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"A20 Ameliorates Intracerebral Hemorrhage\u2013Induced Inflammatory Injury by Regulating TRAF6 Polyubiquitination","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/a20-ameliorates-intracerebral-hemorrhageinduced-inflammatory-injury-regulating-traf6-polyubiquitinat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8348788,"mean":7.0413328717018,"rank":2138706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5070713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8348788,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242312,"mean":12.593478414104,"rank":80601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":159254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242312,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6872,"mean":2.8980256149032,"rank":1062,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6872,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":214,"mean":3.9487699530516,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":214,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"TNFAIP3","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=784881211#altmetric_citation_a7c2db74-f614-4aa9-ae87-092d96ea3a74","license":"public","citation_ids":[20945292,20945292],"posted_on":"2017-06-10T14:33:45+00:00","summary":"Tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein 3 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TNFAIP3 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14753906","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Mrbigtoe","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Mrbigtoe"}}]}}
