We performed univariable and multivariable analyses of the LLQ scores and age, RIT, AMD severity, subfoveal choroidal thickness [SFCT], phakic status, and best-corrected visual acuity.\nThe primary outcome of this study was the score on the 32-question LLQ. Each item in the LLQ is designated to 1 of 6 subscales describing functional problems in low luminance: driving, emotional distress, mobility, extreme lighting, peripheral vision, and general dim lighting. Scores were computed for each subscale, in addition to a weighted total mean score.\nResponses from 113 participants (mean age, 76.2\u00b19.3 years; 58.4% were female) and 113 study eyes were analyzed. Univariable analysis demonstrated that lower scores on all LLQ subscales were correlated with prolonged DA testing (longer RIT) and decreased choroidal thickness. All associations were statistically significant except for the association of choroidal thickness and \"peripheral vision.\" The strongest association was the LLQ subscale of driving with RIT (r\u00a0=-0.97, P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis for each of the LLQ subscale outcomes, adjusted for age, included RIT, with total LLQ score, \"driving,\" \"extreme lighting,\" and \"mobility\" also including choroidal thickness. In all multivariable analyses, RIT had a stronger association than choroidal thickness.\nThis cross-sectional analysis demonstrates associations of patient-reported functional deficits, as assessed on the LLQ, with both reduced DA and reduced choroidal thickness, in a population of older adults with varying degrees of AMD severity and good visual acuity in at least 1 eye. These analyses suggest that local functional measurements of DA testing (RIT) and choroidal thickness are associated with patient-reported functional deficits.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003250","authors":["Mohammad Yazdanie","Jason Alvarez","Elvira Agr\u00f3n","Wai T.
