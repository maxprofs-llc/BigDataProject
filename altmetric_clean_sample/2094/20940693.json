This manipulator works under an upright optical microscope with 3 mm focal distance. The design of the microscope helps us tomanipulate nanowires using the microscope probes as a two-prong fork. The AFM feedback is realized based on the dynamic full-time contact mode. The applications of the manipulator and advantages of its two-probe design are presented.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003488","authors":["A. A. Zhukov","V. S. Stolyarov","O. V.
