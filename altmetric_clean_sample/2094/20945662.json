A lifetime occupational history was obtained for all subjects in the study and assessment of exposure to diesel exhaust was based on the job titles of the subject and self-reported exposure. The risk was assessed by odds ratios, with adjustment for confounding variables, in particular cigarette smoking. There was no evidence of elevated risk in occupations with possible or probable exposure (the ORs adjusted for smoking were 1.1. and 0.9 respectively). Truck driving alone was also not associated with elevated risk (adjusted OR = 0.5). There was a weak positive crude association with any exposure, including self-reports (OR = 1.4); however after adjustment for smoking, the estimate did not retain statistical significance (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.8-2.0). This study provides little to support the hypothesis of an excess of bladder cancer risk from occupational exposure to diesel exhaust.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000734b","authors":["Iyer, V","Harris, R E","Wynder, E L"],"first_seen_on":"2017-06-10T15:37:41+00:00","issns":["0393-2990"],"issue":"1","journal":"European Journal of Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1497109048,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/1693120\/"],"pmid":"1693120","pubdate":"1990-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["epidemiology"],"title":"Diesel exhaust exposure and bladder cancer risk.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diesel-exhaust-exposure-bladder-cancer-risk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.85,"score_history":{"1y":0.85,"6m":0.85,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8348788,"mean":7.0413328717018,"rank":6025268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2311568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8348788,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242312,"mean":12.593478414104,"rank":156853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":85225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242312,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":819,"mean":9.2703643031785,"rank":684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":819,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":2.9557692307692,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pachogongil\/statuses\/873564782091173888","license":"gnip","rt":["PolucionBogota"],"citation_ids":[20945662],"posted_on":"2017-06-10T15:37:28+00:00","author":{"name":"franciscogonzalezgil","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"pachogongil","tweeter_id":"1084712089","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1210},"tweet_id":"873564782091173888"}]}}
