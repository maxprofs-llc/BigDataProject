Subjects \/ Patients and Methods Consecutively from January 2014 to October 2015, 15 patients with high-risk urothelial carcinoma in renal pelvis or upper 2\/3 ureter underwent extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy (EL-RNU) and extraperitoneal laparoscopic lymph node dissection (EL-LND). Clinical and pathological data, histological nodal status, peri-operative complications and recurrence data were collected. Results All of the 15 patients were treated with EL-RNU and EL-LND in modified supine position, and none was converted to open surgery. The mean operation time was 178 \u00b1 18 minutes. The mean estimated blood loss was 140 \u00b1 40 ml. The mean postoperative intestinal function recovery time was 2 days. The mean postoperative hospitalization was 7 \u00b1 1 days. Pathologic studies revealed positive lymph nodes in 3 (20%) patients. The mean number of harvested lymph node was 12 \u00b1 3. No local recurrence and distant metastasis were found after a median follow-up of 14.4 months (7 to 23 months). Conclusions EL-RNU and EL-LND in modified supine position, are mini-invasive and feasible for patients with urothelial carcinoma in renal pelvis or upper 2\/3 ureter. Good exposure and dissection of the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava, integrity of the peritoneum are key to the operational success of this approach.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036e4","authors":["Li, Pengchao","Tao, Jun","Deng, Xiaheng","Qin, Chao","Cheng, Yidong","Li, Peng","Zhang, Jiexiu","Cao, Yongke","Yang, Xiao","Yang, Chengdi","Lu, Qiang","Pengchao Li","Jun Tao","Xiaheng Deng","Chao Qin","Yidong Cheng","Peng Li","Jiexiu Zhang","Yongke Cao","Xiao Yang","Chengdi Yang","Qiang Lu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.urology.2017.05.048","first_seen_on":"2017-06-11T00:19:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0090-4295","00904295","1527-9995"],"journal":"Urology","last_mentioned_on":1497434652,"links":["http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090-4295(17)30605-2\/fulltext?rss=yes","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28606776?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28606776","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Extraperitoneal Laparoscopic Radical Nephroureterectomy and Lymph Node Dissection in Modified Supine Position","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":6348592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1134057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242861,"mean":12.614508218727,"rank":171930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242861,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3305,"mean":4.2477039951574,"rank":2520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3305,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":3.6565625,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UrologyMatch\/statuses\/873696015005741056","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20949154],"posted_on":"2017-06-11T00:18:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Urology Match","url":"http:\/\/www.urologymatch.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/670243589750935552\/vkJCRb_7_normal.jpg","description":"Premier Internet portal to keep abreast of the exciting field of Urology.
