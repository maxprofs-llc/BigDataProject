The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of NSY50 application on cucumber growth, soil properties and composition of the rhizospheric soil microbial community after exposure to Fusarium oxysporum. Bacterial and fungal communities were investigated by Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions (ITS1 and ITS2). The results showed that NSY50 effectively reduced the incidence of Fusarium wilt (56.4%) by altering the soil physico-chemical properties (e.g., pH, Cmic, Rmic, total N and Corg) and enzyme activities, especially of urease and \u03b2-glucosidase, which were significantly increased by 2.25- and 2.64-fold, respectively, relative to the pathogen treatment condition. More specifically, NSY50 application reduced the abundance of Fusarium and promoted potentially beneficial groups, including the Bacillus, Actinobacteria, Streptomyces, Actinospica, Catenulispora and Pseudomonas genera. Thus, our results suggest that NSY50 application can improve soil properties, shift the microbial community by increasing beneficial strains and decreasing pathogen colonization in the cucumber rhizosphere, and reduce the occurrence of cucumber Fusarium wilt, thereby promoting cucumber growth.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Lu Shi","Nanshan Du","Sheng Shu","Jin Sun","Shuzhan Li","Shirong Guo"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep41234","first_seen_on":"2017-02-14T15:27:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1487262720,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep41234"],"pmid":"28198807","pubdate":"2017-02-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Soil microbiology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biotic","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Paenibacillus polymyxa NSY50 suppresses Fusarium wilt in cucumbers by regulating the rhizospheric microbial community","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep41234","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/paenibacillus-polymyxa-nsy50-suppresses-fusarium-wilt-cucumbers-regulating-rhizospheric-microbial-co"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.08,"score_history":{"1y":8.08,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":1067912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":7145876,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271072,"mean":12.93319818055,"rank":53031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":217585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271072,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34841,"mean":14.818586280138,"rank":7697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":27121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34841,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3691,"mean":16.881352845528,"rank":958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":2730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3691,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
