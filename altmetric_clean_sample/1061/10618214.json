Within-group effects of the interventions were larger than the between-groups effects when compared to controls.\nBrief, targeted single-session sexual risk reduction interventions demonstrate a small but significant effect and should be prioritized.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002270","authors":["Michael J.
