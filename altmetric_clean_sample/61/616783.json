The objective of the present analysis was to examine cross-sectional associations in television (TV)\/video viewing, sugar-sweetened beverage intake, and fast food intake between mothers and their preschool aged children. We studied baseline data among 428 participants in High Five for Kids, a randomized controlled trial of behavior change among overweight and obese children of ages 2-6.9 years. The main exposures were whether mothers viewed TV\/videos <1 h\/day, drank <1 serving\/day of sugar-sweetened beverages, and ate fast food <1 time\/week. The main outcomes were whether children met these goals for the same behaviors. Using multivariate logistic regression adjusted for maternal and child characteristics, we estimated odds ratios of children meeting the behavioral goals. The majority of mothers ate fast food <1 time\/week (73%) and drank <1 serving\/day of sugar-sweetened beverages (73%), while few mothers viewed <1 h\/day of TV\/videos (31%). Most children met the fast food goal (68%), but not the goals for sugar-sweetened beverages (31%) or TV\/video viewing (13%). In adjusted models, the odds ratios for a child meeting the goal were 3.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7, 6.2) for TV\/video viewing, 5.8 (95% CI 2.8, 12.0) for sugar-sweetened beverage intake, and 17.5 (95% CI 9.8, 31.2) for fast food intake if their mothers met the goal for the same behavior. Obesogenic behaviors of mothers and preschool aged children were strongly associated. Our findings lend support to obesity prevention strategies that target parental behavior and the family environment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000834f","doi":"10.1038\/oby.2012.43","first_seen_on":"2012-02-22T21:01:28+00:00","issns":["1930-7381"],"journal":"Obesity","last_mentioned_on":1402336881,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22349735?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22349735"],"pmid":"22349735","pubdate":"2012-02-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","physiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Associations of obesogenic behaviors in mothers and obese children participating in a randomized trial.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/associations-obesogenic-behaviors-mothers-obese-children-participating-randomized-trial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":1928826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3067143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81625,"mean":4.7192191757327,"rank":22069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":58714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81625,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1837,"mean":13.680790849673,"rank":953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1837,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":10.752794520548,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
