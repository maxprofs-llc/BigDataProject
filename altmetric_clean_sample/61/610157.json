The overall response was 82.6% at month +2, and subsequently stabilized to \u223c 90% at months +6 and +12; the response was better in warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (WAIHA; overall response, 100% at all time points) than in cold hemagglutinin disease (CHD; average, 60%); the relapse-free survival was 100% for WAIHA at +6 and +12 months versus 89% and 59% in CHD, respectively, and the estimated relapse-free survival at 2 years was 81% and 40% for the warm and cold forms, respectively. The risk of relapse was higher in CHD and in patients with a longer interval between diagnosis and enrollment. Steroid administration was reduced both as cumulative dose (\u223c 50%) and duration compared with the patient's past history. Treatment was well tolerated and no adverse events or infections were recorded; retreatment was also effective. The clinical response was correlated with amelioration biologic markers such as cytokine production (IFN-\u03b3, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-17), suggesting that low-dose rituximab exerts an immunomodulating activity. This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01345708.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","doi":"10.1182\/blood-2011-06-363556","first_seen_on":"2012-02-17T19:40:51+00:00","issns":["1528-0020"],"journal":"Blood","last_mentioned_on":1353381317,"links":["http:\/\/bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org\/content\/early\/2012\/01\/20\/blood-2011-06-363556"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org\/content\/early\/2012\/01\/20\/blood-2011-06-363556.full.pdf","pmid":"22267606","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Low dose rituximab in adult patients with idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia: clinical efficacy and biological studies","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lowdose-rituximab-adult-patients-idiopathic-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-clinical-efficacy-biologic-s-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":782628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3720151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79671,"mean":4.4935511986946,"rank":12366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":67207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79671,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7808,"mean":2.91063507109,"rank":854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":6947,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7808,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":2.0300555555556,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
