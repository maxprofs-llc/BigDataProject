A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine revealed a low-signal-density lesion compressing the L5 nerve. A computed tomography scan was then ordered, confirming an extra-foraminal disc protrusion at the L5-S1 level, containing a focus of gas that was compressing the left L5 nerve root and communicating with the vacuum disc at L5-S1. After a failed left L5 transforaminal epidural steroid injection, the patient was brought back for a percutaneous intradiscal aspiration of the vacuum disc gas. This resulted in immediate relief for the patient. A follow-up MRI performed 2\u00a0months after the procedure found an approximate 25% reduction in the size of the vacuum disc herniation. Six months after the procedure, the patient remains free of radicular pain. This case report suggests that a percutaneous aspiration of gas from a vacuum disc herniation may assist in the treatment of radicular pain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f610007672","authors":["Pak KI","Hoffman DC","Herzog RJ","Lutz GE"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11420-010-9168-x","first_seen_on":"2012-02-21T04:18:12+00:00","issns":["1556-3316"],"issue":"1","journal":"HSS Journal","last_mentioned_on":1329797681,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22294964"],"pmcid":"PMC3026103","pmid":"22294964","pubdate":"2012-02-03T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Percutaneous intradiscal aspiration of a lumbar vacuum disc herniation: a case report.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/percutaneous-intradiscal-aspiration-lumbar-vacuum-disc-herniation-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633425,"mean":4.921826751301,"rank":2015218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":946631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633425,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76450,"mean":4.0737773155959,"rank":32275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":29568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76450,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":1.2298850574713,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.0333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"SA":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/tomeopath\/status\/171810045569404929","citation_ids":[613682],"posted_on":"2012-02-21T04:14:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom Nicholls","url":"http:\/\/www.allbodyosteopathy.co.uk","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2555889052\/image_normal.jpg","description":"Sort of leading by voice, sort of leading by example.\r\nOsteopath in London\/Surrey","id_on_source":"tomeopath","tweeter_id":"21795983","geo":{"lt":51.506325,"ln":-0.127144,"country":"GB"},"followers":267},"tweet_id":"171810045569404929"}]}}
