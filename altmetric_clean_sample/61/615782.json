While a large number of susceptibility genes have been identified, the production of antibodies against a distinct subset of nuclear proteins remains a primary distinguishing characteristic in disease diagnosis. However, the utility of autoantibody biomarkers for disease sub-classification and grouping remains elusive, in part, because of the difficulty in large scale profiling using a uniform, quantitative platform. In the present study serological profiles of several known SLE antigens, including Sm-D3, RNP-A, RNP-70k, Ro52, Ro60, and La, as well as other cytokine and neuronal antigens were obtained using the luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) approach. The resulting autoantibody profiles revealed that 88% of a pilot cohort and 98% of a second independent cohort segregated into one of two distinct clusters defined by autoantibodies against Sm\/anti-RNP or Ro\/La autoantigens, proteins often involved in RNA binding activities. The Sm\/RNP cluster was associated with a higher prevalence of serositis in comparison to the Ro\/La cluster (P\u200a=\u200a0.0022). However, from the available clinical information, no other clinical characteristics were associated with either cluster. In contrast, evaluation of autoantibodies on an individual basis revealed an association between anti-Sm (P\u200a=\u200a0.006), RNP-A (P\u200a=\u200a0.018) and RNP-70k (P\u200a=\u200a0.010) autoantibodies and mucocutaneous symptoms and between anti-RNP-70k and musculoskeletal manifestations (P\u200a=\u200a0.059). Serologically active, but clinically quiescent disease also had a higher prevalence of anti-IFN-\u03b1 autoantibodies. Based on our findings that most SLE patients belong to either a Sm\/RNP or Ro\/La autoantigen cluster, these results suggest the possibility that alterations in RNA-RNA-binding protein interactions may play a critical role in triggering and\/or the pathogenesis of SLE.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E2001C","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Kathryn H.
