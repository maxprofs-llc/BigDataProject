In practical applications, these biopolymers would enter blood circulation directly or indirectly, positively or passively, rapidly or slowly. Blood is a special tissue of human body, which fulfills many important missions to sustain normal metabolism. The contact with blood of the biopolymers, which are seen as foreign substances by the body, would be harmful or even instantaneously lethal, depending on the nature and the dose of the biopolymers administered. Therefore, it is critical to clearly understand the potential influences of the foreign polymers on blood before the polymers are applied from the lab to bedside. In this review, we discuss the recent studies on the interactions of foreign, solubilized polymer molecules (excluding formed polymer materials) with blood constituents (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, plasma proteins, etc.), to gain insight into the potential in vivo applications of the biopolymers in the biomedical field.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d37","authors":["Zonghua Liu","Yanpeng Jiao","Tong Wang","Yuanming Zhang","Wei Xue"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jconrel.2012.02.005","first_seen_on":"2012-02-24T16:44:36+00:00","issns":["01683659"],"journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","last_mentioned_on":1330101082,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S016836591200082X?v=s5"],"pmid":"22356934","pubdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Interactions between solubilized polymer molecules and blood components","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interactions-between-solubilized-polymer-molecules-blood-components"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":2902465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":76842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76230,"mean":4.1029265764997,"rank":54685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76230,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1447,"mean":1.925387275242,"rank":857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1447,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":1.0935454545455,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
