Sexual Identity Therapy (SIT), (Throckmorton & Yarhouse, 2006) has been developed to assist individuals who are seeking to address potential conflicts between religious and sexual identities by focusing on personal congruence. To facilitate this process, the practice of mindfulness is applied. As an adaptation from its spiritual origins, mindfulness is used to facilitate the treatment of various disorders, such as chronic pain, substance abuse, and depression. It has also been the crux of several different third-wave cognitive and behavioral therapies that consider the \"\u2026 context and functions of psychological phenomena\" (Hayes, 2004, p. 5) for the purpose of helping clients to develop \"\u2026 broad, flexible and effective repertoires\" (p. 6). In this instance, mindfulness is applied to SIT to assist individuals with same-sex attraction to become nonjudgmentally aware of their thoughts and feelings related to same-sex attraction such that they are able to experience their attractions in an open and honest manner without feeling compelled to either dismiss or augment these attractions. Mindful awareness of same-sex attraction facilitates congruence because there is less emphasis on changing behaviors, thoughts or feelings, but rather, changing the relationship the individual has to their experiences of same-sex attraction so that they are experienced as neutral, as opposed to aversive.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f61000867c","doi":"10.1037\/a0022081","first_seen_on":"2012-02-23T12:22:14+00:00","issns":["0033-3204(Print)"],"journal":"Psychotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1330000220,"links":["http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/journals\/pst\/47\/4\/500\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/journals\/pst\/47\/4\/500.pdf","pmid":"21198238","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Educational Publishing Foundation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Facilitating congruence between religious beliefs and sexual identity with mindfulness.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/facilitating-congruence-between-religious-beliefs-sexual-identity-mindfulness"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635050,"mean":4.9227315329755,"rank":1636232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1946770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635050,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76463,"mean":4.0623255473306,"rank":22223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":53424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76463,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179,"mean":2.5632134831461,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":19,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
