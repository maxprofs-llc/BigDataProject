This patient presented with horizontal diplopia that appeared rapidly and without any other neurological symptoms. Symptoms fully resolved with treatment interruption without any ophthalmological sequelae. This side effect is rare and has never been reported in a HIV-HCV co-infected patient.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df5","authors":["Guillaume Mellon","Hind Stitou","Olivier Aoun","Roland Tubiana","Vincent Thibault","Marc Antoine Valantin","Fran\u00e7ois Bricaire"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10156-012-0383-x","first_seen_on":"2012-02-22T19:52:01+00:00","issns":["1341-321X","1437-7780"],"journal":"Journal of Infection & Chemotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1329939868,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/g701554x7246hv00\/"],"pmid":"22350324","pubdate":"2012-02-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Lateral rectus muscle paralysis induced by ribavirin and pegylated interferon-\u03b12a in a patient with HIV\/HCV co-infection","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lateral-rectus-muscle-paralysis-induced-ribavirin-pegylated-interferon%CE%B12a-patient-hivhcv-coinfection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685988,"mean":4.9540738657005,"rank":2947584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":72327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685988,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76511,"mean":4.0761311985361,"rank":54577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76511,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192,"mean":1.3652146596859,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.94583333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/NewMicrobiology\/status\/172406419864301569","citation_ids":[616598],"posted_on":"2012-02-22T19:44:28+00:00","author":{"name":"Luke Scicluna","url":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/lukescicluna","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/714765798\/Luke_Scicluna_normal.jpg","description":"I am a Marketing manager for a Biotechnology company in the UK.
