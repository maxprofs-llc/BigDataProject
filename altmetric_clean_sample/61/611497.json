However, many such conjugates suffer losses in sensitivity and specificity due to nonspecific labeling techniques. We have developed methodology to site-specifically conjugate oligonucleotides to antibodies containing a genetically encoded unnatural amino acid with orthogonal chemical reactivity. These oligobody molecules were used in immuno-PCR assays to detect Her2(+) cells with greater sensitivity and specificity than nonspecifically coupled fragments, and can detect extremely rare Her2(+) cells in a complex cellular environment. Such designed antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates should provide sensitive and specific reagents for diagnostics, as well as enable other unique applications based on oligobody building blocks.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PNAS..109.3731K","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Stephanie A.
