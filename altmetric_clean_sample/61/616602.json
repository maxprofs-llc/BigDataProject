It also represents a therapeutic dilemma for the child psychiatrist. The case of a five-year-old boy with gender identity disorder of childhood is presented and the literature on hypotheses of etiology, treatment, and long-term follow-up is reviewed. The ethical and philosophical questions posed by such a case are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d30","authors":["S. P.
