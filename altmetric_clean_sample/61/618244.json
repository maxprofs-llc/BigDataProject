Two hundred and forty-one engorged females were captured, dissected and the gut content adsorbed on a Whatman filter paper and analysed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique to determinate the bloodmeal origin. Results indicated that Ae v. arabiensis fed primarily on mammals, including horses (35.7% of the bloodmeals), but also on birds (10%). Moreover, associations between horses and birds accounted for 42% of the mixed bloodmeals. These results show an opportunistic feeding behaviour and suggest that Ae v. arabiensis is a probable vector bridging the West Nile virus between horses and birds hosts in the Ferlo area.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f610003091","authors":["FALL, A.
