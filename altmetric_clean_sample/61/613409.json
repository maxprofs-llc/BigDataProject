Pooled caecal contents from each randomly selected slaughter batch, and neck and breast skin from a single carcase were examined for Campylobacter spp. The prevalence of Campylobacter in the caeca of broiler batches was 75\u00b78% (303\/400) compared to 87\u00b73% (349\/400) on broiler carcases. Overall, 27\u00b73% of the carcases were found to be highly contaminated with Campylobacter (\u22651000 c.f.u.\/g). Slaughter in the summer months (June, July, August) [odds ratio (OR) 3\u00b750], previous partial depopulation of the flock (OR 3\u00b737), and an increased mortality at 14 days (\u22651\u00b725% to <1\u00b775%) (OR 2\u00b754) were identified as significant risk factors for the most heavily Campylobacter-contaminated carcases. Four poultry companies and farm location were also found to be significantly associated with highly contaminated carcases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006544","doi":"10.1017\/s0950268812000040","first_seen_on":"2012-02-21T01:21:03+00:00","issns":["1469-4409"],"issue":"-1","journal":"Epidemiology & Infection","last_mentioned_on":1329725063,"links":["http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8490082"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/article_S0950268812000040","pmid":"22336562","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["epidemiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"The prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in broiler flocks and on broiler carcases, and the risks associated with highly contaminated carcases","type":"article","volume":"-1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-campylobacter-spp-broiler-flocks-broiler-carcases-risks-associated-highly-contaminated-ca"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627006,"mean":4.9509722374284,"rank":2018663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627006,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76424,"mean":4.1213484945631,"rank":32522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":28994,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76424,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":751,"mean":3.071736,"rank":393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":751,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.0166666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
