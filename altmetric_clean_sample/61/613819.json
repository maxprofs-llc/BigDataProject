Previous studies demonstrate that vitamin D receptor negatively modulates the proinflammatory NF-kappaB pathway. However, it is unknown how vitamin D receptor regulates IkappaBalpha, the endogenous inhibitor of NF-kappaB. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism of vitamin D receptor deletion and IkappaBalpha expression. We found that cells lacking vitamin D receptor had significantly increased levels of IkappaBalpha mRNA and simultaneously decreased levels of IkappaBalpha protein. Lacking vitamin D receptor abolished its binding to the IkappaBalpha promoter. Moreover, the levels of protein translation regulators and the rate of protein synthesis were both decreased in cells lacking vitamin D receptor. At the post-translational level, IkappaBalpha ubiquitination was enhanced, indicating increased degradation of IkappaBalpha in the absence of vitamin D receptor. We further transfected cells with a plasmid carrying either wild-type or mutant IkappaBalpha. The expression of wild-type IkappaBalpha was much higher in the cells with vitamin D receptor than in the cells without vitamin D receptor, whereas the expression of exogenous IkappaBalpha was equally high in both cell lines. In summary, vitamin D receptor deletion affects IkappaBalpha through mRNA transcription, protein translation, protein-protein interaction, post-translational modification, and protein degradation, thus reducing the level of IkappaBalpha protein. Cells lacking vitamin D receptor are known in a proinflammatory state with activation of NF-kappaB. Our study provides new insight into vitamin D receptor regulation of an inhibitor of NF-kappaB in inflammation. Deletion of vitamin D receptor contributes to the activation of NF-kappaB on multiple levels.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b26","authors":["Wu S","Xia Y","Liu X","Sun J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biocel.2009.11.012","first_seen_on":"2012-02-21T07:47:04+00:00","issns":["1357-2725"],"issue":"2","journal":"International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1329810182,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19931640"],"pmcid":"PMC2818560","pmid":"19931640","pubdate":"2009-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Vitamin D receptor deletion leads to reduced level of IkappaBalpha protein through protein translation, protein-protein interaction, and post-translational modification.","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitamin-d-receptor-deletion-leads-reduced-level-i%CE%BAb%CE%B1-protein-through-protein-translation-proteinprot"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":3108605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":996654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79352,"mean":4.3974891809807,"rank":49414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":19315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79352,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":933,"mean":3.0056201716738,"rank":631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":933,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.8625,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
