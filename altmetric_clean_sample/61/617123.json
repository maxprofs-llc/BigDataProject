Finding miRNA precursors in genomes is therefore an important task, where computational methods are required. The goal of these methods is to select potential pre-miRNAs which could be validated by experimental methods. With the new generation of sequencing techniques, it is important to have fast algorithms that are able to treat whole genomes in acceptable times. We developed an algorithm based on an original method where an approximation of miRNA hairpins are first searched, before reconstituting the pre-miRNA structure. The approximation step allows a substantial decrease in the number of possibilities and thus the time required for searching. Our method was tested on different genomic sequences, and was compared with CID-miRNA, miRPara and VMir. It gives in almost all cases better sensitivity and selectivity. It is faster than CID-miRNA, miRPara and VMir: it takes \u2248 30 s to process a 1 MB sequence, when VMir takes 30 min, miRPara takes 20 h and CID-miRNA takes 55 h. We present here a fast ab-initio algorithm for searching for pre-miRNA precursors in genomes, called miRNAFold. miRNAFold is available at http:\/\/EvryRNA.ibisc.univ-evry.fr\/.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","doi":"10.1093\/nar\/gks146","first_seen_on":"2012-02-23T09:41:40+00:00","issns":["1362-4962"],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","last_mentioned_on":1349346642,"links":["http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/02\/21\/nar.gks146.short?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/02\/21\/nar.gks146.short?rss=1","http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/02\/21\/nar.gks146.full?etoc","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/nar\/gks146","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22362754","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3367186"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/02\/21\/nar.gks146.full.pdf","pmid":"22362754","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"A fast ab-initio method for predicting miRNA precursors in genomes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fast-abinitio-method-predicting-mirna-precursors-genomes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5222019,"mean":6.1569969054133,"rank":1084533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":4129606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5222019,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82685,"mean":4.7855933917082,"rank":14683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":67840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82685,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9097,"mean":3.8443344327177,"rank":1778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":7295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9097,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":3.0406376811594,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
