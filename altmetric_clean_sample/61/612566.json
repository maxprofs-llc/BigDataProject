Practical and effective methods are needed to recruit, screen, and enroll the high risk and hard-to-reach couples who would most benefit from HIV interventions, such as drug-using female sex workers (FSWs) and their intimate, non-commercial partners. This paper outlines a bi-national, multidisciplinary effort to develop and implement a study protocol for research on the social context and epidemiology of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STI), and high risk behaviors among FSWs and their non-commercial male partners in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. We provide an overview of our study and specifically focus on the sampling, recruitment, screening, and successful enrollment of high risk couples into a public health study in this context.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d8","authors":["Jennifer L Syvertsen","Jennifer L Syvertsen","Angela M Robertson","Daniela Abramovitz","M Gudelia Rangel","Gustavo Martinez","Thomas L Patterson","Monica D Ulibarri","Alicia Vera","Nabila El-Bassel","Steffanie A Strathdee"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2458-12-136","first_seen_on":"2012-02-20T21:17:20+00:00","issns":["","1471-2458"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1331617202,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/12\/136\/abstract"],"pmid":"22348625","pubdate":"2012-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"136","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Study protocol for the recruitment of female sex workers and their non-commercial partners into couple-based HIV research","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/study-protocol-recruitment-female-sex-workers-noncommercial-partners-couplebased-hiv-research"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5028713,"mean":5.9653160399705,"rank":1998111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":2993858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5028713,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81989,"mean":4.734938308045,"rank":23562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":57797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81989,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5508,"mean":6.5531280188851,"rank":2808,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5508,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246,"mean":4.2917959183673,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
