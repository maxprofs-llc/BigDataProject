The bacteria cope with the iron deficiency by using host heme or siderophores synthesized by themselves or other microbes. In contrast to most other nutrients, iron compounds are tightly bound to proteins at the cell surfaces, from which they are further translocated by highly specific proteins across the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria and the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. Once heme and iron siderophores arrive at the cytoplasmic membrane, they are taken up across the cytoplasmic membrane by ABC transporters. Here we present an outline of bacterial heme and iron siderophore transport exemplified by a few selected cases in which recent progress in the understanding of the transport mechanisms has been achieved.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a1","authors":["Volkmar Braun","Klaus Hantke"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cbpa.2011.01.005","endpage":"334","first_seen_on":"2012-02-17T20:44:21+00:00","issns":["13675931"],"issue":"2","journal":"Current Opinion in Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1329463153,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1367593111000044)"],"pmid":"21277822","pubdate":"2011-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"328","title":"Recent insights into iron import by bacteria","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recent-insights-iron-import-bacteria"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631167,"mean":4.9271322908448,"rank":2898590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631167,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76666,"mean":4.1011396856453,"rank":54756,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76666,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":538,"mean":1.9731173184358,"rank":326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":538,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.1612903225806,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":17,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":33,"Student  > Doctoral Student":18,"Student  > Ph.
