A cross-sectional study probed demographics, sexual and drug use behaviors, HIV testing, and prevention services. Of 500 participants, 39.3% recently received a test for HIV. Recent testing was independently associated with expressing lower levels of HIV\/AIDS-related stigmatizing and discriminatory attitudes, more male sex partners, no female sexual partners and knowing HIV status of their last male partner. Expressing lower levels of HIV\/AIDS-related stigmatizing and discriminatory attitudes was independently associated with recent testing, younger age, and knowing HIV status of their last male partner. This study revealed that HIV\/AIDS-related stigmatizing and discriminatory attitudes were common and inversely associated with recent HIV testing. Low levels of testing highlighted the urgent needs to reduce HIV\/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination and expand HIV testing among MSM in Beijing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056e0","authors":["Xuefeng Li","Hongyan Lu","Xiaoyan Ma","Yanming Sun","Xiong He","Chunmei Li","H.
