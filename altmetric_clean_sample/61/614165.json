However, in order to avoid errors and false leads, it is imperative that the annotation of SNP chromosomal positions is accurate and unambiguous. We report on genomic positional discrepancies of various SNP chips for human, cattle and mouse species, and discuss their causes and consequences.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E1025F","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Jo\u00e3o Fadista","Christian Bendixen"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0031025","first_seen_on":"2012-02-21T13:02:43+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"2","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1330151135,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0031025","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0031025"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0031025.pdf","pmid":"22363540","pubdate":"2012-02-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e31025","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Genomic Position Mapping Discrepancies of Commercial SNP Chips","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomic-position-mapping-discrepancies-commercial-snp-chips"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":1993772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2420796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79350,"mean":4.3862787180682,"rank":26403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":50704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79350,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80033,"mean":8.2565004748101,"rank":34097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":43471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80033,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2661,"mean":6.4881210526316,"rank":1060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":1493,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2661,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
