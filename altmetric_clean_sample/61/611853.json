We conducted a national, multicity time-series study of the acute effect of PM(2.5) and PM coarse on the increased risk of death for all causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and respiratory mortality for the years 1999-2005.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027e9","authors":["Zanobetti A","Schwartz J"],"doi":"10.1289\/ehp.0800108","first_seen_on":"2012-02-19T14:55:07+00:00","issns":["0091-6765"],"issue":"6","journal":"Environmental Health Perspectives","last_mentioned_on":1329627600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19590680"],"pmcid":"PMC2702403","pmid":"19590680","pubdate":"2009-07-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"The effect of fine and coarse particulate air pollution on mortality: a national analysis.","type":"article","volume":"117","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-fine-coarse-particulate-air-pollution-mortality-national-analysis-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631090,"mean":4.9276517821564,"rank":288050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":3329912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631090,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76849,"mean":4.0808078024151,"rank":5774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":70919,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76849,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2261,"mean":7.8609353982301,"rank":365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2261,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":8.8146046511628,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":29,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
