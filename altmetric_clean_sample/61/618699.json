The persons with dementia, but also those around them become imbued with the idea that life comes to an end as soon as the diagnosis is pronounced. The aim of this paper is to understand the dominant images related to dementia by means of an inductive framing analysis. The sample is composed of newspaper articles from six Belgian newspapers (2008-2010) and a convenience sample of popular images of the condition in movies, documentaries, literature and health care communications. The results demonstrate that the most dominant frame postulates that a human being is composed of two distinct parts: a material body and an immaterial mind. If this frame is used, the person with dementia ends up with no identity, which is in opposition to the Western ideals of personal self-fulfilment and individualism. For each dominant frame an alternative counter-frame is defined. It is concluded that the relative absence of counter-frames confirms the negative image of dementia. The inventory might be a help for caregivers and other professionals who want to evaluate their communication strategy. It is discussed that a more resolute use of counter-frames in communication about dementia might mitigate the stigma that surrounds dementia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f610008969","authors":["Baldwin Van Gorp","Tom Vercruysse"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.socscimed.2011.12.045","first_seen_on":"2012-02-23T22:25:09+00:00","issns":["02779536"],"journal":"Social Science & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1425913300,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0277953612001037?v=s5","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0277953612001037"],"pmid":"22386639","pubdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Anthropology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"title":"Frames and counter-frames giving meaning to dementia: A framing analysis of\u00a0media content ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/frames-counterframes-giving-meaning-dementia-framing-analysis-media-content"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4849854,"mean":5.7833928500501,"rank":430359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":4416037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4849854,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80783,"mean":4.6715718848258,"rank":6564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":74171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80783,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3034,"mean":8.0566871084735,"rank":549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":2484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3034,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":5.5361728395062,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Student  > Ph.
