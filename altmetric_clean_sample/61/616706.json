Major sequelae, including choanal atresia, sensorineural hearing loss, and cleft palate, each occur in a significant proportion of affected individuals. We present detailed clinical findings in 12 unrelated individuals with MFDM; these 12 individuals compose the largest reported cohort to date. To define the etiology of MFDM, we employed whole-exome sequencing of four unrelated affected individuals and identified heterozygous mutations or deletions of EFTUD2 in all four. Validation studies of eight additional individuals with MFDM demonstrated causative EFTUD2 mutations in all affected individuals tested. A range of EFTUD2-mutation types, including null alleles and frameshifts, is seen in MFDM, consistent with haploinsufficiency; segregation is de novo in all cases assessed to date. U5-116kD, the protein encoded by EFTUD2, is a highly conserved spliceosomal GTPase with a central regulatory role in catalytic splicing and post-splicing-complex disassembly. MFDM is the first multiple-malformation syndrome attributed to a defect of the major spliceosome. Our findings significantly extend the range of reported spliceosomal phenotypes in humans and pave the way for further investigation in related conditions such as Treacher Collins syndrome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ff","authors":["Lines MA","Huang L","Schwartzentruber J","Douglas SL","Lynch DC","Beaulieu C","Guion-Almeida ML","Zechi-Ceide RM","Gener B","Gillessen-Kaesbach G","Nava C","Baujat G","Horn D","Kini U","Caliebe A","Alanay Y","Utine GE","Lev D","Kohlhase J","Grix AW","Lohmann DR","Hehr U","B\u00f6hm D","Majewski J","Bulman DE","Wieczorek D","Boycott KM"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajhg.2011.12.023","first_seen_on":"2012-02-22T20:14:42+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["0002-9297"],"issue":"","journal":"American Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1335112939,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22305528","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3276671","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ajhg.2011.12.023"],"pmid":"22305528","pubdate":"2012-02-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Haploinsufficiency of a Spliceosomal GTPase Encoded by EFTUD2 Causes Mandibulofacial Dysostosis with Microcephaly","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/haploinsufficiency-spliceosomal-gtpase-encoded-eftud2-causes-mandibulofacial-dysostosis-microcephaly"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634360,"mean":4.9196455088828,"rank":680306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2930290,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634360,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76351,"mean":4.0643901506221,"rank":11935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":64075,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76351,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2910,"mean":6.3459388105878,"rank":713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":2107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2910,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":8.6424347826087,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
