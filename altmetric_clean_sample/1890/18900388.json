Presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), heart disease, respiratory disease, liver disease, asplenia, and smoking at the time of immunization was verified on medical records in 139 subjects developing the primary endpoint of VT-CAP. Presence of DM and respiratory disease based on International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) coding was also determined in 40,427 subjects.\nIn the 139 subjects developing VT-CAP, DM caused significant effect modification (p-value 0.002), yielding VE of 89.5% (95%CI, 65.5-96.8) and 24.7% (95%CI, -10.4 to 48.7) for those with and without DM, respectively. Comparable effect modification (p-value 0.020) was found in the 40,427 subjects with and without ICPC-based classification of DM with VE of 85.6% (95%CI, 36.7-96.7) and of 7.0% (95%CI, -58.5 to 45.5) respectively. Effect modification through respiratory disease was not statistically significant, although the point estimate of VE was lower for those with respiratory disease in both analyses. There was no evidence of effect modification in subjects stratified by heart disease, smoking, and presence of any comorbidity.\nAmong immunocompetent elderly, VE of PCV13 was modified by DM with higher VE among subjects with DM. Significant effect modification was not observed for subjects with heart disease, respiratory disease, smoking, or presence of any comorbidity.
