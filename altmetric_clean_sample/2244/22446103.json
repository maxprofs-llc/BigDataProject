At repeat CT examinations performed at intervals of 2.5 to 6 weeks after initiation of therapy, the lesions had resolved in two patients and become significantly smaller (less than 50% of their pretreatment size) in two. Albendazole therapy in responders hastened the resolution of the lesions and confirmed the diagnosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b59","authors":["Vedantam Rajshekhar"],"doi":"10.1212\/wnl.43.6.1238","first_seen_on":"2017-07-26T11:24:13+00:00","issns":["0028-3878","1526-632X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1104537600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1212\/WNL.43.6.1238"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.neurology.org\/content\/43\/6\/1238.full.pdf","pmid":"8170573","pubdate":"1993-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Albendazole therapy for persistent, solitary cysticercus granulomas in patients with seizures","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/albendazole-therapy-persistent-solitary-cysticercus-granulomas-patients-seizures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8116919,"mean":6.8862047718038,"rank":2047896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4953969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8116919,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96841,"mean":10.916553035936,"rank":30009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":65825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96841,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9718,"mean":13.467945044767,"rank":4264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":3968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9718,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156,"mean":14.222451612903,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"WHO\/FAO\/OIE guidelines for the surveillance, prevention and control of taeniosis\/cysticercosis \/ editor: K.
