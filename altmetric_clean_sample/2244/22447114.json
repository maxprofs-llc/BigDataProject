We investigated whether growth from birth to 10 years of age is associated with blood concentrations of DDE and PCB taken at 8 years of age.\nWe ambispectively followed up a cohort of 343 German children. DDE and PCB blood concentrations were determined in 1995. Height measurements were conducted prospectively between 1994 and 1997 and obtained retrospectively from each Child's Health Card. Linear regression models for repeated measurements, controlling for confounding factors, were applied.\nGrowth was significantly reduced by an average of 1.8 cm (P <.0275) for girls in the highest DDE concentration quartile (>.44 microg\/L in whole blood) compared with girls in the lowest quartile (0.08-0.2 microg\/L). There was no observed growth effect of DDE in boys. PCB blood concentrations were not related to growth reduction in either girls or boys.\nBackground level concentrations to DDE, but not PCB, during childhood are associated with a small reduction in growth for girls evident through the age of 8 years. The observed differences narrow at the year 9 examination and disappear at the year 10 examination. No effects on boys' heights were observed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a88","authors":["Wilfried Karmaus","Scott Asakevich","Alka Indurkhya","Jutta Witten","Hermann Kruse"],"doi":"10.1067\/mpd.2002.120764","first_seen_on":"2017-07-26T11:29:32+00:00","issns":["00223476"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1293840000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1067\/mpd.2002.120764"],"pmid":"11815761","pubdate":"2002-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Childhood growth and exposure to dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene and polychlorinated biphenyls","type":"article","volume":"140","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/childhood-growth-exposure-dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethene-polychlorinated-biphenyls"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8116919,"mean":6.8862047718038,"rank":2047968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4953901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8116919,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96841,"mean":10.916563362247,"rank":30009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":65825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96841,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5905,"mean":8.1242052845529,"rank":1714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":2604,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5905,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":4.5914146341463,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
