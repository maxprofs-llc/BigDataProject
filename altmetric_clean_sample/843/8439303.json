In this study, we developed an enantioselective GC-MS\/MS method to quantify residues of the fungicides fenpropidin, fenpropimorph, and spiroxamine in plant matrices. In field trials, the fungicides were applied to grapevines, sugar beets, or wheat. Fenpropidin was metabolized with no or only weak enantioselectivity. For fenpropimorph, slightly enantioselective metabolism was observed in wheat, but more pronounced in sugar beets. This enantioselectivity was due to different rates of metabolism and not due to interconversion of enantiomers. The four stereoisomers of spiroxamine were also metabolized at different rates, but selectivity was only found between diastereomers and not between enantiomers. Trans-spiroxamine was preferentially degraded in grapes, cis-spiroxamine in wheat. These findings may affect the consumer dietary risk assessment, since toxicological endpoints were determined using racemic test substances.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006625","authors":["Buerge, Ignaz J","Krauss, J\u00fcrgen","L\u00f3pez-Cabeza, Roc\u00edo","Siegfried, Werner","St\u00fcssi, Michael","Wettstein, Felix E","Poiger, Thomas","Buerge, I.J.","Ignaz J.
