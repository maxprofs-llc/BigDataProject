PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"To evaluate the visual and anatomical outcomes for neovascular age-related macular degeneration with submacular hemorrhage after intravitreal injections of tenecteplase (TNK), anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and expansile gas.\nThis study was a retrospective clinical case series following 25 eyes of 25 patients. All patients received a triple injection using 0.05 mL TNK (50 \u00b5g), 0.05 mL anti-VEGF and 0.3 mL of perfluoropropane gas. Retreatment with anti-VEGF was performed as needed. Preoperative and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity and central retinal thickness were analyzed.\nThe mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution of best-corrected visual acuity improved significantly from 1.09 \u00b1 0.77 at baseline to 0.52 \u00b1 0.60 at 12 months (p < 0.001). The mean central retinal thickness also improved significantly from 545 \u00b1 156 at baseline to 266 \u00b1 107 at 12 months (p < 0.001). A visual improvement of 0.3 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution unit or more was achieved in 15 eyes (60%). During the 12 postoperative months, an average of 4.04 intravitreal anti-VEGF injections was applied.\nA triple injection of TNK, anti-VEGF, and a gas appears to be safe and effective for the treatment of submacular hemorrhage secondary to neovascular age-related macular degeneration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f9d","authors":["Lee, Jung Pil","Park, Jun Sang","Kwon, Oh Woong","You, Yong Sung","Kim, Soon Hyun"],"doi":"10.3341\/kjo.2016.30.3.192","first_seen_on":"2016-06-02T11:38:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1011-8942","2092-9382"],"issue":"3","journal":"Korean Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1464867494,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27247518?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4878979","pmid":"27247518","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"192","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Management of Acute Submacular Hemorrhage with Intravitreal Injection of Tenecteplase, Anti-vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and Gas","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-acute-submacular-hemorrhage-intravitreal-injection-tenecteplase-antivascular-endothelial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":6796952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269355,"mean":11.374010729374,"rank":224448,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269355,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178,"mean":0.71920903954802,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VEGFRSSfeeds\/statuses\/738333900347342848","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8438757],"posted_on":"2016-06-02T11:38:14+00:00","author":{"name":"VEGF RSS Feeds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516588600\/VEGF_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"VEGFRSSfeeds","tweeter_id":"88511740","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":363},"tweet_id":"738333900347342848"}]}}
