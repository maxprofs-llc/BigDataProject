The objective of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the association between BPH and MetS in men who were referred to surgery for BPH. We were interested in identifying the anthropometric, metabolic, and hormonal factors that potentially influence the risk of both conditions.\nThe study was conducted on 128 males with BPH and 141 without BPH (the control group). Fasting glucose, insulin, lipid profiles, total and free testosterone, estradiol, sex-hormone binding protein (SHBG), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) index, and lipid accumulation product (LAP) were all evaluated.\nThe prevalence of MetS was higher in patients with BPH than in the controls (58 vs. 41\u00a0%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.007). In comparison to the controls, patients with BPH had higher levels of cholesterol, low density lipoproteins, DHEA-S, insulin, and HOMA-IR, but lower levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL), estradiol, and SHBG. The significant predictors of BPH were MetS (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.961), age (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.11), HDL (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.91), insulin (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.224), SHBG (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.98), and estradiol (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.978). Waist circumference and LAP inversely correlated with total and free testosterone and SHBG.\nOur study confirmed the frequent coexistence of MetS and BPH. This association seems to be a consequence of the MetS-related metabolic derangements, changes in the sex-hormone milieu, and lowered SHBG levels.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000807","authors":["Aleksandra Ry\u0142","Iwona Rotter","Tomasz Miazgowski","Marcin S\u0142ojewski","Barbara Do\u0142\u0119gowska","Anna Lubkowska","Maria Laszczy\u0144ska"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13098-015-0089-1","first_seen_on":"2016-06-02T10:09:32+00:00","issns":["1758-5996"],"issue":"1","journal":"Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome","last_mentioned_on":1464861787,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4625953\/"],"pmid":"26516352","pubdate":"2016-06-02T20:15:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Diabetes","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Endocrinology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Metabolic Diseases","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Metabolic syndrome and benign prostatic hyperplasia: association or coincidence?","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolic-syndrome-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia-association-coincidence"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":4110432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2186292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269355,"mean":11.374020753358,"rank":145948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269355,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275,"mean":5.27,"rank":149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.175,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Chemistry":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jiro31\/statuses\/738309963395661824","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8437025],"posted_on":"2016-06-02T10:03:07+00:00","author":{"name":"\u9ad8\u9808\u3000\u4e8c\u90ce","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1402349598\/IMG_0162_normal.jpg","description":"\u6d66\u5b89\u306b\u4f4f\u3080\u6ccc\u5c3f\u79d1\u3001\u814e\u4e0d\u5168\u79fb\u690d\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u3067\u3059\u3002\u5730\u57df\u533b\u7642\u306b\u9081\u9032\u3057\u3066\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u3053\u3067\u306f\u697d\u3057\u307f\u306a\u304c\u3089\u4f55\u6c17\u306a\u3044\u65e5\u5e38\u3092\u767a\u4fe1\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002","id_on_source":"jiro31","tweeter_id":"70359201","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":68},"tweet_id":"738309963395661824"}]}}
