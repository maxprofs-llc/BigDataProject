Body mass index (BMI) \u226525\u00a0kg\/m(2) was the standard of obesity and waist circumference \u226580\u00a0cm was the standard of central obesity. Patient and tumor characteristics were compared between obesity categories. Survival differences between obesity categories were assessed with log-rank test in the univariate analysis and prognostic factors were then investigated by Cox regression analysis.\n81 cases were with obesity (39.3\u00a0%). 71 cases were with central obesity (34.5\u00a0%). Patients with obesity or central obesity tended to be older (P\u00a0=\u00a00.022 for obesity; P\u00a0=\u00a00.013 for central obesity) and to have larger tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a00.027 for obesity; P\u00a0=\u00a00.027 for central obesity). By Cox regression analysis, central obesity (DFS: HR 1.759; 95\u00a0% CI 1.009-3.065; P\u00a0=\u00a00.046. OS: HR 2.297; 95\u00a0% CI 1.184-4.456; P\u00a0=\u00a00.014) was identified as an independent prognostic factor. For central obesity with BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a025\u00a0kg\/m(2), the prognostic effect was more apparent (DFS: HR 1.845; 95\u00a0% CI 1.059-3.212; P\u00a0=\u00a00.031. OS: HR 2.377; 95\u00a0% CI 1.230-4.593; P\u00a0=\u00a00.010).\nCentral obesity, especially with high BMI, was an independent prognostic factor for TNBC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8113cf058f61000bb46","authors":["Chen, Hong-Liang","Ding, Ang","Wang, Mao-Li"],"doi":"10.1186\/s40064-016-2200-y","first_seen_on":"2016-06-02T10:34:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2193-1801"],"issue":"1","journal":"SpringerPlus","last_mentioned_on":1464864037,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27247890?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4864763","pmid":"27247890","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Science, general","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Impact of central obesity on prognostic outcome of triple negative breast cancer in Chinese women","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-central-obesity-prognostic-outcome-triple-negative-breast-cancer-chinese-women"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":6796947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269355,"mean":11.374017783289,"rank":224443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269355,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1713,"mean":3.1911425233645,"rank":1341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1713,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":3.3918723404255,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Computer Science":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/738317818991517696","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8437873],"posted_on":"2016-06-02T10:34:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":722},"tweet_id":"738317818991517696"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/738319402685239296","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8437873],"posted_on":"2016-06-02T10:40:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":722},"tweet_id":"738319402685239296"}]}}
