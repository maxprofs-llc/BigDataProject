We show that HMGB1 alters the structure and stability of the canonical nucleosome (N) in a nonenzymatic, adenosine triphosphate-independent manner. As a result, the canonical nucleosome is converted to two stable, physically distinct nucleosome conformers. Although estrogen receptor (ER) does not bind to its consensus estrogen response element within a nucleosome, HMGB1 restructures the nucleosome to facilitate strong ER binding. The isolated HMGB1-restructured nucleosomes (N' and N'') remain stable and exhibit a number of characteristics that are distinctly different from the canonical nucleosome. These findings complement previous studies that showed (1) HMGB1 stimulates in vivo transcriptional activation at estrogen response elements and (2) knock down of HMGB1 expression by siRNA precipitously reduced transcriptional activation. The findings indicate that a major facet of the mechanism of HMGB1 action involves a restructuring of aspects of the nucleosome that appear to relax structural constraints within the nucleosome. The findings are extended to reveal the differences between ER and the other steroid hormone receptors. A working proposal outlines mechanisms that highlight the multiple facets that HMGB1 may utilize in restructuring the nucleosome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc8c","authors":["Scovell, William M"],"doi":"10.4331\/wjbc.v7.i2.206","first_seen_on":"2016-06-02T12:47:27+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1949-8454"],"issue":"2","journal":"World Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1464871628,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27247709?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4877529","pmid":"27247709","pubdate":"2016-05-26T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"206","title":"High mobility group protein 1: A collaborator in nucleosome dynamics and estrogen-responsive gene expression","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-mobility-group-protein-1-collaborator-nucleosome-dynamics-estrogenresponsive-gene-expression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":6796950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269354,"mean":11.374034207898,"rank":224444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269354,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":1.6951923076923,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/statuses\/738351241500053504","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8439823],"posted_on":"2016-06-02T12:47:08+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
