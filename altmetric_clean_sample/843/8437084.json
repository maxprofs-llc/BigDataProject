The aim of this study is to report the safety and efficacy of catheter ablation using this technology in patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF.\nThe data of a prospective registry describing the experience of a single operator using this technology on 327 consecutive patients were analysed. The mean procedure time was 69 \u00b1 22 min for paroxysmal AF (n = 228) and 75 \u00b1 23 min for persistent AF (n = 97). Follow-up was available for 206 (63%) patients for 6 \u00b1 5 months (range 1-23, median 3.3). Single procedure success off antiarrhythmic drugs was 75% in paroxysmal AF and 52% in persistent AF. Including the 5% redo cases and those on antiarrhythmic medication, freedom from AF was documented in 90 and 83% of paroxysmal and persistent AF patients, respectively. There were no serious complications in the first 325 patients, but the last two consecutive patients (0.6%) developed atrio-oesophageal fistulas and had a fatal outcome. The catheter has been recalled from market.\nThe nMARQ catheter is a highly effective tool for treatment of paroxysmal and persistent AF. Nevertheless, the occurrence of life-threatening oesophageal fistulas is of major concern and requires further investigation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007321","authors":["Vurma, Martin","Dang, Lam","Brunner-La Rocca, Hans-Peter","S\u00fctsch, Gabor","Attenhofer-Jost, Christine H","Duru, Firat","Scharf, Christoph"],"doi":"10.1093\/europace\/euw048","first_seen_on":"2016-06-02T10:11:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-2092","1099-5129"],"journal":"Europace","last_mentioned_on":1464861907,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27247003?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27247003","pubdate":"2016-05-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"euw048","subjects":["physiology","cardiology"],"title":"Safety and efficacy of the nMARQ catheter for paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-efficacy-nmarq-catheter-paroxysmal-persistent-atrial-fibrillation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":6796951,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269355,"mean":11.374023537797,"rank":224447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269355,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1086,"mean":3.8069419354839,"rank":728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1086,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":4.9465517241379,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CardiologiaF\/statuses\/738310467941081088","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8437084],"posted_on":"2016-06-02T10:05:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Cardiolog\u00eda-Fabumed","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1561758151\/fabumed_normal.png","description":"Cardiolog\u00eda.
