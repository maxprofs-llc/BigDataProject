Herein, we report a 56-year-old woman with metastases to the hypopharynx almost 24 years after receiving a mastectomy and chemotherapy to treat primary breast carcinoma. We believe that she is the first patient to be treated for metastatic breast carcinoma to the hypopharynx. The hypopharyngeal tumor reduced in size after administration of an oral aromatase inhibitor. The patient has remained alive with a preserved larynx for three years.\nBreast cancer metastasis to the hypopharynx is an extremely rare event.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8113cf058f61000bb46","authors":["Izumi, Chisako","Misawa, Kiyoshi","Endo, Shiori","Sugiyama, Kenichi","Mochizuki, Daiki","Imai, Atsushi","Mima, Masato","Misawa, Yuki","Yamatodani, Takashi","Mineta, Hiroyuki"],"doi":"10.1186\/s40064-016-2226-1","first_seen_on":"2016-06-02T10:34:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2193-1801"],"issue":"1","journal":"SpringerPlus","last_mentioned_on":1464875374,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27247895?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4864781","pmid":"27247895","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Science, general","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Late recurrence of breast carcinoma metastasis to the hypopharynx: a case report","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/late-recurrence-breast-carcinoma-metastasis-hypopharynx-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":5951921,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1050161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269355,"mean":11.373945573483,"rank":188185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269355,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1713,"mean":3.1911425233645,"rank":1066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1713,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":3.3918723404255,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/738317879913807872","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8437881],"posted_on":"2016-06-02T10:34:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":722},"tweet_id":"738317879913807872"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/738319404652367872","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8437881],"posted_on":"2016-06-02T10:40:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":722},"tweet_id":"738319404652367872"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/738366954411433984","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8437881],"posted_on":"2016-06-02T13:49:34+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":386},"tweet_id":"738366954411433984"}]}}
