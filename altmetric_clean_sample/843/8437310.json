However, few reports have been published that explore the efficacy of Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV)-inducible promoters in antiviral research in the Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera). Here, we screened BmNPV promoters (VP1054, P33, Bm21, Bm122, 39K, P143, and P6.9) and found that the 39K promoter had the highest BmNPV-induced transcriptional activity by dual-luciferase reporter assays system. By 5' truncation analysis, two regions of 39K promoter were critical for optimal virus-inducible activity, indicated that they could serve as a candidate to produce synthetic pathogen-induced promoters. Furthermore, we enhanced the virus-inducible activity of BmNPV 39K promoter using a hybrid enhancer comprising hr3 and polh-up (designated as HP39K). Finally, we showed that RNAi regulated by HP39K promoter could significantly inhibit the proliferation of BmNPV in silkworm cells. Taken together, our results have practical value in antiviral research of silkworm and baculovirus expression system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd3","authors":["Cao, Ming-Ya","Kuang, Xiu-Xiu","Li, Hai-Qing","Lei, Xue-Jiao","Xiao, Wen-Fu","Dong, Zhan-Qi","Zhang, Jun","Hu, Nan","Chen, Ting-Ting","Lu, Cheng","Pan, Min-Hui"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbiotec.2016.05.037","first_seen_on":"2016-06-02T10:18:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-4863","01681656"],"journal":"Journal of Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1464866532,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27245143?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27245143","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Screening and optimization of an efficient Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus inducible promoter","type":"article","volume":"231","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/screening-optimization-efficient-bombyx-mori-nucleopolyhedrovirus-inducible-promoter"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":3884388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3763758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269354,"mean":11.374050172079,"rank":133907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":124619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269354,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":959,"mean":3.1672693110647,"rank":335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":959,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":1.8641176470588,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":5,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":8,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"CN":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RNAi_papers\/statuses\/738312607283613697","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8437310],"posted_on":"2016-06-02T10:13:37+00:00","author":{"name":"RNAi papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"Twitter bot searching the web for new journal articles on #RNAi therapeutics for plants and animals","id_on_source":"RNAi_papers","tweeter_id":"2902044872","geo":{"lt":54.58333,"ln":-5.93333,"country":"GB"},"followers":45},"tweet_id":"738312607283613697"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lepido_papers\/statuses\/738329865150074881","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8437310],"posted_on":"2016-06-02T11:22:12+00:00","author":{"name":"lepidopapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/558930683972685824\/x5EhqwSQ_normal.jpeg","description":"Continuous feed for papers on Lepidoptera from PubMed.
