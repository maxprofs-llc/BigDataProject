These studies have become more and more refined with respect to establishing causality between dimensions of alcohol consumption and different disease and mortality (cause of death) outcomes, refining risk relations, and improving the methodology for estimating exposure and alcohol-attributable burden. The present review will give an overview on the main results of the CRAs with respect to alcohol consumption as a risk factor, sketch out new trends and developments, and draw implications for future research and policy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000089d","authors":["J\u00fcrgen Rehm","Sameer Imtiaz"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13011-016-0081-2","first_seen_on":"2016-11-07T11:33:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1747-597X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy","last_mentioned_on":1479933221,"links":["https:\/\/substanceabusepolicy.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13011-016-0081-2","https:\/\/substanceabusepolicy.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13011-016-0081-2#Sec12"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/substanceabusepolicy.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13011-016-0081-2?site=substanceabusepolicy.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"27793173","pubdate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Health Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Policy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"37","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"A narrative review of alcohol consumption as a risk factor for global burden of disease","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/narrative-review-alcohol-consumption-risk-factor-global-burden-disease-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.5,"score_history":{"1y":10.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7729992,"mean":6.6289680453638,"rank":710965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7012275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7729992,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234048,"mean":12.954350707336,"rank":35899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":197856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234048,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":309,"mean":6.4583636363636,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":309,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":23.408333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
