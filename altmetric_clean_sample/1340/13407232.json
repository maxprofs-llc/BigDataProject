(Studer)"],"citation":{"abstract":"Bifunctional mesoporous silica was prepared by co-condensation of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) with functionalized organosilanes containing azides or alkoxyamines. Orthogonal functional groups at the particles were selectively addressed in subsequent chemical modifications through \"click\"-chemistry (\"click to ligand\" strategy) and radical nitroxide exchange. Palladation with PdCl2 delivered Pd nanoparticle-loaded silica material bearing sulfoxides and additional aminoamides as stabilizing ligands by means of in situ reduction of the Pd(II) -salt. These functional particles were successfully applied to the hydrogenation of alkynes and alkenes. Aldehyde hydrodeoxygenation and benzyl ether cleavage were achieved with these hybrid catalysts under mild conditions. Particles were analyzed by IR, TEM\/STEM, EDX, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Surmiak, Sabrina K.","Doerenkamp, Carsten","Selter, Philipp","Peterlechner, Martin","Sch\u00e4fer, Andreas H.","Eckert, Hellmut","Studer, Armido"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201604508","first_seen_on":"2016-11-07T11:03:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-3765"],"issue":"25","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1478593741,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201604508\/abstract;jsessionid=67465D35CFC83684CFC1384C7EC731AB.f01t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201604508\/pdf","pmid":"28464507","pubdate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Palladium Nanoparticle Loaded Bifunctional Silica Hybrid Material: Preparation and Applications as Catalyst in Hydrogenation Reactions","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/palladium-nanoparticle-loaded-bifunctional-silica-hybrid-material-preparation-applications-catalyst-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7662843,"mean":6.5825569912527,"rank":5796236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1032118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7662843,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232912,"mean":12.932038272129,"rank":160432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":44316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232912,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5444,"mean":3.1119537020026,"rank":3185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1604,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5444,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":587,"mean":2.1228737201365,"rank":274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":587,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemEurJ\/statuses\/795582178323263488","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13407232],"posted_on":"2016-11-07T11:02:27+00:00","author":{"name":"Chemistry","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/journal\/10.1002\/(ISSN)1521-3765","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/669149218846720000\/C7lWCugX_normal.jpg","description":"Chemistry - A European Journal\r\nMultidisciplinary Chemistry Journal from ChemPubSoc Europe","id_on_source":"ChemEurJ","tweeter_id":"1522831152","geo":{"lt":49.54887,"ln":8.66697,"country":"DE"},"followers":3520},"tweet_id":"795582178323263488"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EurJOC\/statuses\/795729123717038084","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13407232],"posted_on":"2016-11-07T20:46:21+00:00","author":{"name":"EurJOC","url":"http:\/\/www.eurjoc.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/762950375649476608\/X-3g_cz-_normal.jpg","description":"The European Journal of Organic Chemistry, published on behalf of @chempubsoc_euro, brings you the latest developments in organic  chemistry.","id_on_source":"EurJOC","tweeter_id":"762946792912785408","geo":{"lt":49.54887,"ln":8.66697,"country":"DE"},"followers":488},"tweet_id":"795729123717038084"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemEurJ\/statuses\/795905954386677760","license":"gnip","rt":["EurJOC"],"citation_ids":[13407232],"posted_on":"2016-11-08T08:29:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Chemistry","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/journal\/10.1002\/(ISSN)1521-3765","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/669149218846720000\/C7lWCugX_normal.jpg","description":"Chemistry - A European Journal\r\nMultidisciplinary Chemistry Journal from ChemPubSoc Europe","id_on_source":"ChemEurJ","tweeter_id":"1522831152","geo":{"lt":49.54887,"ln":8.66697,"country":"DE"},"followers":3520},"tweet_id":"795905954386677760"}]}}
