However, the impact of weight abnormalities on sperm quality is still contestable. To assess the correlation between BMI and sperm parameters, we searched relevant articles in PubMed, Embase, Web of science, and Wanfang database published until June 2015 without language restriction. Otherwise, we also recruited some participants who attended fertility clinic as well as some general populations in this report. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis about BMI and sperm parameters containing total sperm count, concentration, semen volume and sperm motility (overall and progressive). Metabolomic analysis of seminal plasma was performed to explore the mechanism from a new perspective. This study found standardized weighted mean differences (SMD) in sperm parameters (total sperm count, sperm concentration, and semen volume) of abnormal weight groups decreased to different degree compared to normal weight. Dose-response analysis found SMD of sperm count, sperm concentration and semen volume respectively fell 2.4%, 1.3% and 2.0% compared with normal weight for every 5-unit increase in BMI. Metabolomic analysis of seminal plasma showed that spermidine and spermine were likely to play a vital role in the spermatogenesis progress. This systematic review with meta-analysis has confirmed there was a relationship between BMI and sperm quality, suggesting obesity may be a detrimental factor of male infertility.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Guo, Dan","Wu, Wei","Tang, Qiuqin","Qiao, Shanlei","Chen, Yiqiu","Chen, Minjian","Teng, Mengying","Lu, Chuncheng","Ding, Hongjuan","Xia, Yankai","Hu, Lingqing","Chen, Daozhen","Sha, Jiahao","Wang, Xinru"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.14950","first_seen_on":"2017-02-19T03:45:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1487609840,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28159940"],"pmid":"28159940","publisher":"Impact Journals, LLC","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"The impact of BMI on sperm parameters and the metabolite changes of seminal plasma concomitantly","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-bmi-sperm-parameters-metabolite-changes-seminal-plasma-concomitantly"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":3897795,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4166650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242356,"mean":13.705056961894,"rank":119242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":115981,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242356,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8793,"mean":3.1483036851683,"rank":1785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8793,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300,"mean":12.840555183946,"rank":136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
