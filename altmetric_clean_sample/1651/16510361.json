She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention to the obtuse marginal artery with a drug-eluting stent 20 months prior to this presentation. Physical examination was remarkable for bradycardia. Electrocardiogram showed a junctional rhythm with heart rate of 35 bpm. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Despite successful urgent pacemaker placement, she had cardiac arrest the following day with unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation attempt. Cardiac autopsy report revealed multiple abscesses involving the obtuse marginal and left anterior descending arteries as well as the adjacent myocardial regions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ae","authors":["Ayman Elbadawi","Marwan Saad","Islam Y.
