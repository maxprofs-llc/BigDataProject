The patient had a history of neurosurgery for a meningeal hemangiopericytoma 16 years previously. Pre-operative imaging revealed a hypervascular tumor extending from Couinaud segment 4 to segment 8 of the liver, measuring 95\u00a0mm in diameter, indicating an atypical hepatocellular carcinoma. Because right trisectionectomy of the liver was considered to be high risk, living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) was indicated. After transcatheter arterial embolization, LDLT was performed with the use of a left-lobe liver graft from the patient's son. Post-operative histological findings of the liver tumor were identical to those for meningeal hemangiopericytoma, therefore the patient was diagnosed with meningeal hemangiopericytoma that had metastasized to the liver. After LDLT, the patient had a healthy, active life for 2 years; then, a subcutaneous relapse was discovered in the left chest. The patient did not undergo any systemic chemotherapy in response to the relapse. After thoracic and orthopedic surgeries and radiotherapy for multiple metastases, the patient died 5 years and 5 months after LDLT. LDLT could be an effective treatment for localized metastatic hemangiopericytoma in the liver, but it should be indicated only for carefully selected patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003694","authors":["Urata, K","Ikegami, T","Nakazawa, Y","Ohno, Y","Kobayashi, A","Mita, A","Sano, K","Kurozumi, M","Miyagawa, S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.transproceed.2015.06.027","endpage":"2277","first_seen_on":"2016-05-11T12:21:39+00:00","issns":["1873-2623","00411345"],"issue":"7","journal":"Transplantation Proceedings","last_mentioned_on":1462969281,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26361698?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26361698","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2274","title":"Living-Donor Liver Transplantation for Hepatic Metastasis From\u00a0Meningeal Hemangiopericytoma: A Case Report","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/livingdonor-liver-transplantation-hepatic-metastasis-meningeal-hemangiopericytoma-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7684314,"mean":6.5948576928038,"rank":6648330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7684314,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267935,"mean":11.424767427799,"rank":223869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267935,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1141,"mean":1.4058894736842,"rank":748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1141,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":1.2947692307692,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
