Under the catalysis of the formed G-quadruplex\/hemin complex, H2O2 could be decomposed into hydroxyl radicals with strong oxidation properties. Then caffeic acid would be oxidized by the released hydroxyl radicals, resulting in the product caffeic acid-quinone. Normally, caffeic acid has no influence on the fluorescence of graphene quantum dots. But when mixed with the G-quadruplex\/hemin complex and H2O2, the fluorescence of graphene quantum dots was obviously quenched by the oxidized caffeic acid. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the quenched fluorescence intensity was linearly correlated with the concentration of caffeic acid, ranging from 2 \u03bcM to 350 \u03bcM with a detection limit of 200 nM. The proposed method was applied to the determination of caffeic acid in human serum samples with satisfactory results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002247","authors":["Nan Cai","Yan Li","shufan Chen","Xingguang Su","Shufan Chen"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6an00543h","endpage":"4462","first_seen_on":"2016-05-11T12:41:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1364-5528"],"issue":"14","journal":"Analyst","last_mentioned_on":1462970472,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/AN\/C6AN00543H?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed:%20rss\/AN%20(RSC%20-%20Analyst%20latest%20articles)"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/an\/c6an00543h","pmid":"27220084","pubdate":"2016-05-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"4456","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Fluorometric Assay Platform for Caffeic Acid Detection Based on the G-quadruplex\/hemin DNAzyme","type":"article","volume":"141","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fluorometric-assay-platform-caffeic-acid-detection-based-gquadruplexhemin-dnazyme"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7684314,"mean":6.5948576928038,"rank":6648328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7684314,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267934,"mean":11.424808388664,"rank":223869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267934,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1995,"mean":2.8935165496489,"rank":1612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1995,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":1.969025,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
