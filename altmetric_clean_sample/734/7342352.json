We, therefore, conducted this study to determine the association between lead exposure and the neurodevelopment and behaviour of children aged 12-24\u00a0months in Kinshasa, DRC. A cross-sectional study was conducted between February and June 2012, and parents of 104 children were invited to participate. Blood lead levels (BLLs) of each child were tested using the flame atomic spectrophotometry method. All children were subject to a clinical examination and assessed with two selected early child neurodevelopmental tools, the Gensini-Gavito and the baby characteristics questionnaire, to measure their neurodevelopment and temperament. Detectable BLLs ranged from 1 to 30\u00a0\u03bcg\/dl with a geometric mean of 6.9 (SD 4.8)\u00a0\u03bcg\/dl. BLLs at 5-9 and\u00a0\u226510\u00a0\u03bcg\/dl were significantly associated with the child temperament (p\u00a0<0.05). Perinatal and maternal factors did not seem to affect early child neurodevelopment and temperament. Children exposed to lead were reported with more temperament difficulties at even blood lead levels\u00a0<10\u00a0\u03bcg\/dl, suggesting the need for preventive and intervention measures to reduce lead exposure among children in Kinshasa, DRC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002817","authors":["Esp\u00e9rance Kashala-Abotnes","P\u00e9p\u00e9 Penghele Mumbere","Jeannette Mukanya Mishika","Ally Omba Ndjukendi","Davin Beya Mpaka","Makila-Mabe Guy Bumoko","Tharcisse Kalula Kayembe","D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Tshala-Katumbay","Th\u00e9odore Kayembe Kazadi","Daniel Luwa E-Andjafono Okitundu","Kashala-Abotnes, Esp\u00e9rance","Mumbere, P\u00e9p\u00e9 Penghele","Mishika, Jeannette Mukanya","Ndjukendi, Ally Omba","Mpaka, Davin Beya","Bumoko, Makila-Mabe Guy","Kayembe, Tharcisse Kalula","Tshala-Katumbay, D\u00e9sir\u00e9","Kazadi, Th\u00e9odore Kayembe","Okitundu, Daniel Luwa E-Andjafono"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00787-016-0860-3","first_seen_on":"2016-05-11T13:26:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1435-165X","1018-8827"],"journal":"European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1463963846,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00787-016-0860-3","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27165339"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00787-016-0860-3.pdf","pmid":"27165339","pubdate":"2016-05-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry","pediatrics"],"title":"Lead exposure and early child neurodevelopment among children 12\u201324 months in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lead-exposure-early-child-neurodevelopment-among-children-1224-months-kinshasa-democratic-republic-c-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7737442,"mean":6.6309810015932,"rank":3788330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3751301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7737442,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268438,"mean":11.432930296494,"rank":134060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":123791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268438,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":734,"mean":4.4393369713506,"rank":432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":734,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":2.8668571428571,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
