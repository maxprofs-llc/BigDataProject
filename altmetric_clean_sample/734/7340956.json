Changes in haemodynamics [heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO)] and peripheral muscle oxygenation [oxyhaemoglobin ([HbO2]), deoxyhaemoglobin ([HHb]), total haemoglobin ([tHb]), tissue saturation index (TSI)] and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) were continuously recorded during simulated dynamic BH. BHDs showed a breaking point in HR kinetics at mid-BH immediately preceding a more pronounced drop in HR (-0.86\u00a0bpm.%(-1)) while HR kinetics in NDs steadily decreased throughout BH (-0.47\u00a0bpm.%(-1)). By contrast, SV remained unchanged during BH in both groups (all P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) results (mean \u00b1 SD) expressed as percentage changes from the initial values showed a lower [HHb] increase for BHDs than for NDs at the cessation of BH (+24.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.1 vs. +39.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.6%, respectively; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). As a result, BHDs showed a [tHb] drop that NDs did not at the end of BH (-7.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2 vs. -3.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7%, respectively; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The most striking finding of the present study was that BHDs presented an increase in oxygen-conserving efficiency due to substantial shifts in both cardiac and peripheral haemodynamics during simulated BH. In addition, the kinetic-based approach we used provides further credence to the concept of an \"oxygen-conserving breaking point\" in the human diving response.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f61000150d","authors":["Guillaume Costalat","Jeremy Coquart","Ingrid Castres","Fabrice Joulia","Olivier Sirost","Eric Clua","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lema\u00eetre"],"doi":"10.1080\/02640414.2016.1183809","endpage":"10","first_seen_on":"2016-05-11T12:00:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0264-0414","1466-447X"],"journal":"Journal of Sports Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1463042532,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/02640414.2016.1183809"],"pmid":"27167834","pubdate":"2016-05-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"The oxygen-conserving potential of the diving response: A kinetic-based analysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oxygenconserving-potential-diving-response-kineticbased-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7690302,"mean":6.5973724521265,"rank":3982781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2161057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7690302,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267990,"mean":11.425066588554,"rank":145580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267990,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2100,"mean":12.333597903764,"rank":1708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2100,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":19.55032,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":3,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":7,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Design":1,"Engineering":2,"Medicine and Dentistry":8,"Neuroscience":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Sports and Recreations":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JSportsSci\/statuses\/730366874421231616","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7340956],"posted_on":"2016-05-11T12:00:07+00:00","author":{"name":"J of Sports Sciences","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/rjsp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/665121187421405184\/qSTYWLkj_normal.png","description":"The official account of the Journal of Sports Sciences - publishing high-quality research in the areas of sport and exercise science for over 30 years.","id_on_source":"JSportsSci","tweeter_id":"1570265839","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":30189},"tweet_id":"730366874421231616"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RodrigoZacca\/statuses\/730679456277336064","license":"gnip","rt":["JSportsSci"],"citation_ids":[7340956],"posted_on":"2016-05-12T08:42:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Zacca, Rodrigo","url":"http:\/\/lattes.cnpq.br\/9409696644333101","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/896036505411612672\/REk73CEd_normal.jpg","description":"#Swimming #OpenWater #TrackAndField #Triathlon #Soccer #PerformanceAnalysis #Coach #Research @ufrgsnoticias\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 @gpea_ufrgs\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 @UPorto @LABIOMEP \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf9","id_on_source":"RodrigoZacca","tweeter_id":"62605370","geo":{"lt":-10,"ln":-55,"country":"BR"},"followers":1161},"tweet_id":"730679456277336064"}]}}
