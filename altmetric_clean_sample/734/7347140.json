The MDRH of NH4Cl-NaCl, NH4Cl-(NH4)2SO4 and, for the first time the NaCl-NaBr systems was acquired as a function of mole ratio. These changes were studied using Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. The MDRH of 1:1 salt mixtures was consistently found to be lower than the individual deliquescence relative humidity (iDRH) of the NH4Cl-NaCl and the NH4Cl-(NH4)2SO4. The exception was the MDRH of the NaCl-NaBr system, which was found to be higher than the iDRH of NaBr particles, but lower than the iDRH of NaCl particles. When the mole ratio of the mixed system was varied, the MDRH of the mixtures showed a slight dependence on the mole ratio.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","authors":["Bryant N.
