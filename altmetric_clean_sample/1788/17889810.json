We have previously demonstrated that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) signalling contributes to increased voiding frequency and decreased bladder capacity with cystitis. Despite the functional presence of TGF-\u03b2 in bladder inflammation, the precise mechanisms of TGF-\u03b2 mediating bladder dysfunction are not yet known. Thus, the present studies investigated the sensory components of the urinary bladder that may underlie the pathophysiology of aberrant TGF-\u03b2 activation. We utilized bladder-pelvic nerve preparations to characterize bladder afferent nerve discharge and the mechanisms of urothelial ATP release with distention. Our findings indicate that bladder afferent nerve discharge is sensitive to elevated extracellular ATP during pathological conditions of urinary bladder inflammation or irritation. We determined that TGF-\u03b21 may increase bladder afferent nerve excitability by stimulating ATP release from the urothelium via vesicular exocytosis mechanisms with minimal contribution from pannexin-1 channels. Furthermore, blocking aberrant TGF-\u03b2 signalling in cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis with T\u03b2R-1 inhibition decreased afferent nerve hyperexcitability with a concomitant decrease in urothelial ATP release. Taken together, these results establish a role for purinergic signalling mechanisms in TGF-\u03b2 mediated bladder afferent nerve activation that may ultimately facilitate increased voiding frequency. The synergy between intrinsic urinary bladder signalling mechanisms and an inflammatory mediator provides novel insight into bladder dysfunction and supports new avenues for therapeutic intervention.
