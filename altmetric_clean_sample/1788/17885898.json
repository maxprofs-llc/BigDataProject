We report here a major role for the TGF-\u03b2\/Smad3 adaptor \u03b22-Spectrin (\u03b22SP, gene Sptbn1) in maintaining genomic stability following alcohol-induced DNA damage. \u03b22SP supports DNA repair through \u03b22SP-dependent activation of Fancd2, a core component of the Fanconi anemia complex. Loss of \u03b22SP leads to decreased Fancd2 levels and sensitizes \u03b22SP mutants to DNA damage by ethanol treatment, leading to phenotypes that closely resemble those observed in animals lacking both Aldh2 and Fancd2, and resemble human fetal alcohol syndrome. Sptbn1-deficient cells are hypersensitive to DNA cross-linking agents, and have defective DNA double-strand break repair that is rescued by ectopic Fancd2 expression. Moreover, Fancd2 transcription in response to DNA damage\/TGF-\u03b2 stimulation is regulated by the \u03b22SP\/Smad3 complex. Thus, dysfunctional TGF-\u03b2\/\u03b22SP signaling impacts the processing of genotoxic metabolites by altering the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway. This article is protected by copyright.
