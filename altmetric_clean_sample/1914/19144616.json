Survivors completed measures of body image, emotional distress and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Body image dissatisfaction (BID) was categorized into two groups (cancer-related and general) based on factor analysis. Using causal mediation analysis, we estimated the proportion of psychological distress associated with treatment-related scarring\/disfigurement that could be eliminated by resolving BID through a hypothetical intervention.\nAmong survivors with scarring\/disfigurement of the head, a sizable proportion of the relative excess of psychological distress could be eliminated if BID was successfully treated (Males: [cancer-related BID: depression: 63%; anxiety: 100%; PTSS: 52%]; [general BID: depression: 70%; anxiety: 100%; PTSS: 42%]; Females: [cancer-related BID: depression: 20%; anxiety; 36%; PTSS: 23%]; [general BID: depression: 32%; anxiety: 87%; PTSS: 38%]). The mediating effect of BID was less pronounced for the association between scarring\/disfigurement of the body and psychological distress for both males and females.\nBody image dissatisfaction mediates the association treatment-related scarring\/disfigurement and psychological distress among adult survivors of childhood cancer, particularly among survivors with scarring\/disfigurement of the head and male survivors. Successful treatment of body image dissatisfaction has the potential to eliminate a substantial proportion of psychological distress related to scarring\/disfigurement among adult survivors of childhood cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033e8","authors":["Vuotto, Stefanie C.","Ojha, Rohit P.","Li, Chenghong","Kimberg, Cara","Klosky, James L.","Krull, Kevin R.","Srivastava, Deo Kumar","Robison, Leslie L.","Hudson, Melissa M.","Brinkman, Tara M."],"doi":"10.1002\/pon.4439","first_seen_on":"2017-04-18T18:08:26+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1057-9249","1099-1611","10579249"],"journal":"Psycho-Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1492690287,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/pon.4439\/abstract;jsessionid=A75A1BF5182EE5B403AF895B7337D949.f02t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/pon.4439\/abstract;jsessionid=6461BAF20BA63C3A39A85C3AC9E443B6.f04t04","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/pon.4439"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/pon.4439\/pdf","pmid":"28419648","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","psychology"],"title":"The role of body image dissatisfaction in the association between treatment-related scarring or disfigurement and psychological distress in adult survivors of childhood cancer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-body-image-dissatisfaction-association-between-treatmentrelated-scarring-disfigurement-psycholo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8089090,"mean":6.870452360944,"rank":4275472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2247014,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8089090,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233436,"mean":12.769628804592,"rank":130320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":81885,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233436,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1273,"mean":5.2876886792453,"rank":818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1273,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.7972222222222,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/854396159376359426","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19144616],"posted_on":"2017-04-18T18:08:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":980},"tweet_id":"854396159376359426"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LESS_Study\/statuses\/855026358828892164","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19144616],"posted_on":"2017-04-20T11:52:24+00:00","author":{"name":"LESS-Study","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/627223228554027008\/hznUX6O-_normal.png","description":"#Aftercare and #LateEffects after #ChildhoodCancer.
