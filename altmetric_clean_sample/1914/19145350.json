Knowledge about meningococcal disease and vaccine was generally high; more than 70% correct responses were received on each knowledge question except for one question about the different meningococcal serogroups. Gender (female) and higher knowledge scores were significantly associated with either being immunized or intending to be immunized (p<0.05). Positive attitudes about immunization, concern about meningococccal infection, a sense of community responsibility, and trust in public health advice also correlated with being vaccinated or intending to be vaccinated (p<0.05).\nA successful mass vaccination program in a Nova Scotia university was associated with high levels of knowledge, positive attitudes toward vaccination, and positive attitudes toward public health recommendations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ea","authors":["D.M.
