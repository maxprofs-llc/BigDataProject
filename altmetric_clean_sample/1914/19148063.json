From an extensive Pubmed search 46 clinical applications of capnography were listed. To classify these we used six categories- Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Anesthetic Delivery Apparatus, Homeostasis and Non-perioperative. This list collates the described uses of capnography and this system of classification provides an aide-de-memoir in anesthesia education and simulation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bea","authors":["Naveen Eipe","Jordan Tarshis"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10877-007-9094-8","first_seen_on":"2017-04-18T23:11:37+00:00","issns":["1387-1307","1573-2614"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing","last_mentioned_on":1492603330,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17924200"],"pmid":"17924200","pubdate":"2007-11-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Anesthesiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Intensive \/ Critical Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Statistics for Life Sciences, Medicine, Health Sciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine","medicalinformatics"],"title":"A system of classification for the clinical applications of capnography","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/system-classification-clinical-applications-capnography-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.2,"score_history":{"1y":2.2,"6m":2.2,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083930,"mean":6.8667526310456,"rank":3424965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4645660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083930,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233148,"mean":12.762842206848,"rank":93360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":139257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233148,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":352,"mean":1.4944387464387,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":352,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":3.0642857142857,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1,"AU":1,"DK":1},"mendeley":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NaveenEipe\/statuses\/854472450498809857","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19148063],"posted_on":"2017-04-18T23:11:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Naveen Eipe","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/847237295140773888\/upAiiP2X_normal.jpg","description":"Anesthesiologist with interest in Acute Pain, Difficult Airways, ERAS & Bariatrics.","id_on_source":"NaveenEipe","tweeter_id":"2824799129","geo":{"lt":45.41117,"ln":-75.69812,"country":"CA"},"followers":815},"tweet_id":"854472450498809857"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AusNurseEd\/statuses\/854580767040561153","license":"gnip","rt":["NaveenEipe"],"citation_ids":[19148063],"posted_on":"2017-04-19T06:21:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Cheryl Prescott","url":"https:\/\/redapplern.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/877349108448583680\/6M4LL0Hd_normal.jpg","description":"Nurse Educator.
