Regarding the role of HFE in iron homeostasis, iron accumulation is considered an important process in ALS. Furthermore, novel therapeutic strategies are being developed targeting this process. Evidence for this genetic association is, however, limited to several small studies. For this reason we studied the H63D polymorphism in a large European cohort including 3962 ALS patients and 5072 control subjects from 7 countries. After meta-analysis of previous studies and current findings we conclude that the H63D polymorphism in HFE is not associated with susceptibility to ALS, age at disease onset, or survival.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f61000318e","authors":["van Rheenen W","Diekstra FP","van Doormaal PT","Seelen M","Kenna K","McLaughlin R","Shatunov A","Czell D","van Es MA","van Vught PW","van Damme P","Smith BN","Waibel S","Schelhaas HJ","van der Kooi AJ","de Visser M","Weber M","Robberecht W","Hardiman O","Shaw PJ","Shaw CE","Morrison KE","Al-Chalabi A","Andersen PM","Ludolph AC","Veldink JH","van den Berg LH","Wouter van Rheenen","Frank P.
