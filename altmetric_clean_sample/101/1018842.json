Plasma was deproteinized and liquid-liquid extraction performed with hexane. After evaporation, the residue was dissolved in organic solvents (ether:methanol 25:75, V\/V). Standard curves were prepared by adding known amounts of standards to plasma. The use of acetonitrile in the mobile phase (acetonitrile:methanol:water 64.5:33:2.5, V\/V) avoided interference peaks, giving a total run time of 8 min. Analyte stability required that samples be treated in the dark. Analytical performance was good: recovery around 100%, detection limits 0.015 mg\/l for vit A and 0.030 mg\/l for vit E, linear range 2 mg\/l for vit A and 20 mg\/l for vit E, no recorded interference, and between-run and within-run precision with coefficients of variation < 11%. Analytes were stable at room temperature for 24 h (vit A) and 48 h (vit E) in plasma stored in the dark for one month at -20 degrees C. The standard solution containing both vit A and vit E increased vit A stability. Plasma concentrations (mg\/l) for vit A and E were respectively: 0.63 +\/- 0.17 and 9.61 +\/- 3.1 in adults (n = 29), 0.39 +\/- 0.17 et 7.10 +\/- 2.41 in children 0 to 15 years (n = 21). This method allows regular monitoring of patients with cystic fibrosis to check for retinol and alpha-tocopherol deficiencies. The usefulness and results of the method are discussed in terms of previous studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069eb","first_seen_on":"2012-10-23T21:33:00+00:00","issns":["0003-3898"],"issue":"7-8","journal":"Annales de Biologie Clinique","last_mentioned_on":1351017878,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7840431"],"pmid":"7840431","pubdate":"1994-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"[Determination of plasma retinol and alpha-tocopherol by HPLC].","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/determination-plasma-retinol-alphatocopherol-hplc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636226,"mean":4.921076943263,"rank":2698187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":892841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636226,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78441,"mean":5.1523826874043,"rank":51271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":25413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78441,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":1.3585454545455,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"[Determination of plasma retinol and a...
