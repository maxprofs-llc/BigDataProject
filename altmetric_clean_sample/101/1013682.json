Successful treatment of these fractures should result in complication-free functional pronosupination. Traditionally, these have been treated with closed reduction and casting, but the last several decades have seen a dramatic increase in the operative treatment of these fractures. However, little high-level evidence exists to guide management. The data from the limited set of studies available suggest that closed treatment does usually result in satisfactory outcomes, particularly in younger patients; operative fixation is usually successful as well but comes with a significantly increased complication rate. The ideal study to aid in evidence-based decision-making for pediatric forearm fractures would be a randomly controlled trial comparing closed reduction and casting versus intramedullary nailing versus plating; in children ranging from 8 years old to skeletally mature; with closed forearm fractures, complete or greenstick with >20 degrees of angulation; with a minimum of 5 years of follow-up (or to maturity); with the primary outcome defined as final pronation and supination; using an validated functional outcome tool; and precisely defining the complications from each treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dd4","authors":["Franklin CC","Robinson J","Noonan K","Flynn JM"],"doi":"10.1097\/bpo.0b013e318259543b","first_seen_on":"2012-10-21T10:20:40+00:00","issns":["0271-6798"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics","last_mentioned_on":1468752802,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pedorthopaedics\/Abstract\/2012\/09001\/Evidence_based_Medicine___Management_of_Pediatric.14.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22890452"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pedorthopaedics\/2012\/09001\/Evidence_based_Medicine___Management_of_Pediatric.14.pdf","pmid":"22890452","pubdate":"2012-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"S131","subjects":["orthopedics","pediatrics"],"title":"Evidence-based Medicine: Management of Pediatric Forearm Fractures.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidencebased-medicine-486"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082727,"mean":6.8629605662661,"rank":4040789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3836401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082727,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106021,"mean":5.9431181852482,"rank":48669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":54214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106021,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1626,"mean":2.4213649230769,"rank":663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1626,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":2.7925185185185,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JPO_journ_lww\/statuses\/259962354165485569","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1013682],"posted_on":"2012-10-21T10:20:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Wolters Kluwer","url":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pedorthopaedics\/pages\/default.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1115864455\/image_normal.jpeg","description":"Focuses on traumatic injuries with hands-on on coverage of a fast-growing field.
