Recent studies have shown that downregulation of the microRNA miR-124 occurs in several types of human cancer, suggesting a tumor suppressive function of miR-124. Until now, however, it has been unclear whether miR-124 is associated with CaP. In the present study, we completed a series of experiments to understand the functional role of miR-124 in CaP. We detected the expression level of miR-124 in clinical CaP tissues, evaluated the influence of miR-124 on the growth of CaP cells and investigated the mechanism underlying the dysregulation of miR-124. We found that (i) miR-124 directly targets the androgen receptor (AR) and subsequently induces an upregulation of p53; (ii) miR-124 is significantly downregulated in malignant prostatic cells compared to benign cells, and DNA methylation causes the reduced expression of miR-124; and (iii) miR-124 can inhibit the growth of CaP cells in vitro and in vivo. Data from this study revealed that loss of miR-124 expression is a common event in CaP, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of CaP. Our studies also suggest that miR-124 is a potential tumor suppressive gene in CaP, and restoration of miR-124 expression may represent a novel strategy for CaP therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003240","authors":["Shi XB","Xue L","Ma AH","Tepper CG","Gandour-Edwards R","Kung HJ","Devere White RW"],"doi":"10.1038\/onc.2012.425","endpage":"4138","first_seen_on":"2012-10-22T11:57:23+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["0950-9232","1476-5594"],"issue":"35","journal":"Oncogene","last_mentioned_on":1368471989,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23069658"],"pmid":"23069658","pubdate":"2012-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"4130","subjects":["molecularbiology","neoplasms"],"title":"Tumor suppressive miR-124 targets androgen receptor and inhibits proliferation of prostate cancer cells.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tumor-suppressive-mir124-targets-androgen-receptor-inhibits-proliferation-prostate-cancer-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019832,"mean":6.784478957969,"rank":4223162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2233962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019832,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105982,"mean":5.8487574376539,"rank":51890,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":41017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105982,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4201,"mean":4.2871409523809,"rank":2831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":793,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4201,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":1.7982903225806,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
