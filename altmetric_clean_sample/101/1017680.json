Ninety-two percent of the children reached the previously defined protective level (hemagglutination-inhibition titer \u22651:40), but only 27% of the children reached the level of \u22651:110 which was recently described to predict the conventional 50% clinical protection rate in children. Further studies, and potentially adaptations of the schedule, are needed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008487","authors":["Kusters MA","Bok VL","Bolz W","Huijskens E","Peeters M","de Vries E"],"doi":"10.1097\/inf.0b013e3182737410","first_seen_on":"2012-10-23T13:18:46+00:00","issns":["0891-3668"],"issue":"","journal":"The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal","last_mentioned_on":1350269325,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22986705?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"22986705","pubdate":"2012-09-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases","pediatrics"],"title":"Influenza A\/H1N1 Vaccination Response is Inadequate in Down Syndrome Children When the Latest Cut-Off Values Are Used.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influenza-ah1n1-vaccination-response-inadequate-down-syndrome-children-latest-cutoff-values-used"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628714,"mean":4.9390391673343,"rank":2744395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":726314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628714,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78396,"mean":5.1801571528797,"rank":53121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":19889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78396,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1671,"mean":2.007154491018,"rank":976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1671,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":1.2875,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
