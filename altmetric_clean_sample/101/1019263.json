Here we show that use of micro-semi-balls made of nanodiamond as second-stage anvils in conventional diamond anvil cells drastically extends the achievable pressure range in static compression experiments to above 600 GPa. Micro-anvils (10-50 \u03bcm in diameter) of superhard nanodiamond (with a grain size below \u223c50 nm) were synthesized in a large volume press using a newly developed technique. In our pilot experiments on rhenium and gold we have studied the equation of state of rhenium at pressures up to 640 GPa and demonstrated the feasibility and crucial necessity of the in situ ultra high-pressure measurements for accurate determination of material properties at extreme conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Leonid Dubrovinsky","Natalia Dubrovinskaia","Vitali B Prakapenka","Artem M Abakumov"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms2160","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2012-10-24T00:44:23+00:00","issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1490205991,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncomms\/journal\/v3\/n10\/full\/ncomms2160.html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ncomms2160","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23093199","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3493652","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/ncomms2160"],"pmid":"23093199","pubdate":"2012-10-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1163","subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"Implementation of micro-ball nanodiamond anvils for high-pressure studies above 6\u2009Mbar","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ncomms2160","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/implementation-microball-nanodiamond-anvils-highpressure-studies-above-6mbar"},"altmetric_score":{"score":46.75,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":46.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":201831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8195035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107949,"mean":5.9680492274058,"rank":2029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":105919,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107949,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13122,"mean":44.639898788202,"rank":3322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":9795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13122,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163,"mean":13.734456790123,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
