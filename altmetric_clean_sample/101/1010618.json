The authors report a 3-year-old child, who rapidly developed an oesophageal perforation, following the ingestion of a 20-mm lithium BB which was initially mistaken for a coin. A thoracotomy and T-tube management of the perforation led to a positive outcome. BBs (20 mm) in children should be removed quickly and close observation is required as the damage initiated by the battery can lead to a significant injury within a few hours.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002302","authors":["Soccorso G","Grossman O","Martinelli M","Marven SS","Patel K","Thomson M","Roberts JP"],"doi":"10.1136\/archdischild-2012-301631","first_seen_on":"2012-10-19T10:12:19+00:00","issns":["0003-9888"],"issue":"","journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","last_mentioned_on":1350641527,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22550318?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22550318","pubdate":"2012-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oesophagus","scheme":"bmj"},{"name":"Trauma","scheme":"bmj"},{"name":"Injury","scheme":"bmj"},{"name":"Drugs: psychiatry","scheme":"bmj"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"20 mm lithium button battery causing an oesophageal perforation in a toddler: lessons in diagnosis and treatment.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/20-mm-lithium-button-battery-causing-oesophageal-perforation-toddler-lessons-diagnosis-treatment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633255,"mean":4.9221505741186,"rank":2897974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633255,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78384,"mean":5.16936299963,"rank":58240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78384,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2008,"mean":5.2810792227205,"rank":1703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2008,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":7.0308219178082,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
