The pediatric practitioner can positively influence FV consumption of children through patient-level interventions (eg, counseling, connecting families to community resources), community-level interventions (eg, advocacy, community involvement), and health care facility-level interventions (eg, creating a healthy food environment in the clinical setting). This article reviews the importance of FV consumption, recommended intakes for children, and strategies by which pediatric practitioners can influence FV consumption of children.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c15","authors":["Kim SA","Grimm KA","May AL","Harris DM","Kimmons J","Foltz JL","Sonia A.
