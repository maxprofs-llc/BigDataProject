Three studies tested whether or not depth of processing (as operationalized by manipulations of motivation and ability to cognitively process) moderate the effect. The valence-framing effect was replicated, such that opposers manifested stronger attitudes than did supporters, but only when attitudes were relevant to the participants (Experiments 1 and 3), and when participants were not under cognitive load (Experiment 2). Our results thus identify depth of processing as an important moderator of the valence-framing effect and provide potential insight into the effect's mechanism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002454","authors":["Bizer, George Y.","\u017de\u017eelj, Iris L.","Luguri, Jamie B."],"doi":"10.1111\/bjso.12014","endpage":"201","first_seen_on":"2012-10-22T09:58:36+00:00","issns":["2044-8309","0144-6665"],"issue":"1","journal":"British Journal of Social Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1351292628,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bjso.12014\/abstract;jsessionid=29CD0F2F4616D93824C74DADC29C03EE.d03t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bjso.12014\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bjso.12014\/pdf","pmid":"23083131","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"191","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"When are support and opposition not opposites?
