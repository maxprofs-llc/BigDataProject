After the engineered pDNA is administered to the vaccines, it is transcribed and translated into immunogen proteins that can elicit responses from the immune system. Many ways of delivering DNA vaccines have been investigated; however each delivery route has its own advantages and pitfalls. Skin tattooing is a novel technique that is safe, cost-effective, and convenient. In addition, the punctures inflicted by the needle could also serve as a potent adjuvant. Here, we a) demonstrate the intradermal delivery of plasmid DNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (pCX-EGFP) in a mouse model using a tattooing device and b) confirm the effective expression of EGFP in the skin cells using confocal microscopy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f23","doi":"10.3791\/50032","first_seen_on":"2012-10-19T16:11:32+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["1940-087X"],"journal":"Journal of Visualized Experiments","last_mentioned_on":1412624697,"links":["http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/50032\/skin-tattooing-as-a-novel-approach-for-dna-vaccine-delivery","http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/50032?utm_source=youtube","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23117298#"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jove.com\/pdf\/50032","pmid":"23117298","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"JoVE","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","biology"],"title":"Skin tattooing as a novel approach for DNA vaccine delivery.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/skin-tattooing-novel-approach-dna-vaccine-delivery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230816,"mean":5.9681228064084,"rank":2045404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4159122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230816,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89072,"mean":5.9233059244872,"rank":25857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":62735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89072,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3675,"mean":3.0166526946108,"rank":762,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3675,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.8125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
