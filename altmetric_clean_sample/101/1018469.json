The dependence of the electronic subband energy on the sample parameters of the hollow nanosphere is examined. We find that the subband states with different quantum numbers l degenerate roughly when the outer radius of the sphere is r2 \u2265 100 nm. In this case, the energy spectrum of a sphere is mainly determined by quantum number n. Moreover, the plasmon and surface plasmon excitations can be achieved mainly via inter-subband transitions from occupied subbands to unoccupied subbands. We examine the dependence of the plasmon and surface-plasmon frequencies on the shell thickness d and the outer radius r2 of the sphere using the standard random-phase approximation. We find that when a four-state model is employed for calculations, four branches of the plasmon and surface plasmon oscillations with terahertz frequencies can be observed, respectively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000877","authors":["Xiao, Yiming"],"doi":"10.1186\/1556-276x-7-578","first_seen_on":"2012-10-23T18:59:32+00:00","issns":["1931-7573","1556-276X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Nanoscale Research Letters","last_mentioned_on":1350983425,"links":["http:\/\/www.nanoscalereslett.com\/content\/7\/1\/578"],"pmid":"23092121","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemistry\/Food Science, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Engineering, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Material Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Materials Science, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Molecular Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Physics, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Condensed Matter Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"title":"Terahertz plasmon and surface-plasmon modes in hollow nanospheres","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/terahertz-plasmon-surfaceplasmon-modes-hollow-nanospheres"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635015,"mean":4.9193540767705,"rank":2898916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635015,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78435,"mean":5.1502912257439,"rank":58367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":497,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78435,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":380,"mean":0.90569393139842,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":380,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
