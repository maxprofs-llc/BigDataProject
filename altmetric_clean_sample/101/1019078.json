Total cholesterol serum levels ranged from 120 mg\/dl (10th percentile) throughout 220 mg.dl (90th percentile) and 20.4% of values for blood cholesterol were above 200 mg\/dl. Triglyceride serum concentrations ranged from 57 mg\/dl (10th percentile) throughout 161 mg\/dl (90th percentile) and 11.9% of samples triglyceride levels above 150 mg\/dl. There was only a slight tendency of association between breast stages 4 and 5 according to Tanner and high cholesterol serum levels. There were positive relationships between cholesterol serum levels and body mass index (p < 0.001) and also with family history of coronary heart disease (p < 0.02).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56a768df2a83eeb12a8b47b0","authors":["McColl, P","Amador, M","D\u00edaz, M"],"first_seen_on":"2012-10-23T23:43:20+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0370-4106"],"issue":"1","journal":"Revista chilena de pediatr\u00eda","last_mentioned_on":1350270010,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1843998?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"1843998","pubdate":"1991-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"[Blood cholesterol and triglycerides in adolescents during sexual development].","type":"article","volume":"62","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blood-cholesterol-triglycerides-adolescents-during-sexual-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4655094,"mean":5.6505438971925,"rank":3894627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4655094,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82559,"mean":5.7152470990091,"rank":68092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82559,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"[Blood cholesterol and triglycerides in adolescents during sexual development].","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=537656649594941&id=537654322928507","citation_ids":[1019078],"posted_on":"2012-10-15T03:00:10+00:00","summary":"SCPBogota: Related Articles [Blood cholesterol and triglycerides in adolescents during sexual development].
