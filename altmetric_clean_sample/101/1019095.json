The effect of a hypercaloric formula on nutritional recovery was evaluated in malnourished infants with congenital heart diseases. We retrospectively studied 30 infants (mean age 9 months, range 2 to 21) with CHD along 60 to 90 days in a closed nutritional recovery center. All patients were fed a hypercaloric whole cow's milk formula with sucrose, butter oil and corn starch (1.29 kcal.ml). Mean daily energy intake was 220 +\/- 19.8 kcal.kg body weight.day. Mean weight gain was 2.7 g.kg.day. No effect of cyanosis, cardiac failure, degree of malnutrition or number of illness-free days was observed on nutritional recovery. Patients older than 9 months had significantly greater weight gain than younger infants. Those infants with worse CHD and severe intercurrent illnesses had the worst nutritional recovery. We suggest that a hypercaloric formula induces good nutritional weight gain infants with severe congenital heart disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56a768df2a83eeb12a8b47b0","authors":["Mar\u00edn, V","Rosati, P","Las Heras, M S","Rivera, C","Castillo, C"],"first_seen_on":"2012-10-23T23:43:59+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0370-4106"],"issue":"6","journal":"Revista chilena de pediatr\u00eda","last_mentioned_on":1350269902,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2152213?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"2152213","pubdate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"[Nutritional recovery in infants with congenital heart disease and severe malnutrition using a hypercaloric diet].","type":"article","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nutritional-recovery-infants-congenital-heart-disease-severe-malnutrition-using-hypercaloric-diet"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4655094,"mean":5.6505438971925,"rank":3894627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4655094,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82559,"mean":5.7152470990091,"rank":68092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82559,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
