They belong to two 2D structural types, and their nets own different topologies. The isostructural La and Pr compounds possess a uninodal 5-connected SP 2-periodic net (6,3). The Nd compound has a binodal 3- and 6-connected kgd net. The novel compounds exhibit excellent catalytic activities toward the cyanosilylation reaction under solvent-free conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Richard F.
