She had hypertension, and the angiographic findings revealed a \"string of beads\" appearance in the right renal artery. She underwent balloon angioplasty for left axillary artery stenosis, but it was complicated by dissection. Stenting for axillary artery established TIMI 3 flow to the brachial artery. This case was a result of noninflammatory and probably nonatherosclerotic disease, and the findings in this cases is consistent with those of fibromuscular dysplasia affecting the axillary arterial segment. In summary, we present details of a case presenting with brachial ischemia caused by axillary artery stenosis. We also describe the meticulous investigation required for treating this segmental arterial disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006ded","authors":["Higashimori A","Yokoi Y"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12928-012-0139-7","first_seen_on":"2012-10-22T01:20:07+00:00","issns":["1868-4300"],"issue":"","journal":"Cardiovascular Intervention and Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1366033088,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23065412"],"pmid":"23065412","pubdate":"2012-10-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Interventional Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"The interventional therapy for axillary stenosis with fibromuscular dysplasia of renal artery.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interventional-therapy-axillary-stenosis-fibromuscular-dysplasia-renal-artery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FMDAdvocate\/statuses\/260188736346808320","license":"public","citation_ids":[1014471],"posted_on":"2012-10-22T01:20:03+00:00","author":{"name":"FMDAdvocate","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1247611442\/image_normal.jpg","description":"I am a former research nurse & stroke survivor.
