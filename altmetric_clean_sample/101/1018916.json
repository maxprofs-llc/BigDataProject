Treatment with SERMs for the first 2\u00a0h and treatment 2-24\u00a0h after viral inoculation reduced the production of HCV RNA. Treating persistently JFH-1 infected cells with SERMs resulted in a preferential inhibition of extracellular HCV RNA compared to intracellular HCV RNA. When we treated two subgenomic replicon cells, which harbor HCV genome genotype 2a (JFH-1) or genotype 1b, SERMs reduced HCV genome copies and viral protein NS5A. SERMs inhibited the entry of HCV pseudo-particle (HCVpp) genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b and 4 but did not inhibit vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) entry. Further experiment using HCVpp indicated that tamoxifen affected both viral binding to cell and post-binding events including endocytosis. Taken together, SERMs seemed to target multiple steps of HCV viral life cycle: attachment, entry, replication, and post replication events. SERMs may be potential candidates for the treatment of HCV infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5043cf058f6100030c1","authors":["Yuko Murakami","Masayoshi Fukasawa","Yukihiro Kaneko","Tetsuro Suzuki","Takaji Wakita","Hidesuke Fukazawa"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.micinf.2012.10.003","first_seen_on":"2012-10-23T22:03:54+00:00","issns":["12864579"],"journal":"Microbes & Infection","last_mentioned_on":1351045718,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1286457912002523"],"pmid":"23103222","pubdate":"2012-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Selective estrogen receptor modulators inhibit hepatitis C virus infection at multiple steps of the virus lifecycle","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-inhibit-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-multiple-steps-virus-life-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":3556597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":832014,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85103,"mean":5.7651083640808,"rank":55849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":14967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85103,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":799,"mean":6.4769197994987,"rank":661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":89,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":799,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":2.0616666666667,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/env_micro\/statuses\/260864119194910720","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1018916],"posted_on":"2012-10-23T22:03:47+00:00","author":{"name":"env_micro","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_0_normal.png","description":"","id_on_source":"env_micro","tweeter_id":"528144428","followers":1},"tweet_id":"260864119194910720"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MicrobesInfect\/statuses\/260930773069221888","license":"public","citation_ids":[1018916],"posted_on":"2012-10-24T02:28:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Microbes&Infection","url":"http:\/\/www.journals.elsevier.com\/microbes-and-infection\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/426488743185244160\/KCtE4aFV_normal.png","description":"Microbes and Infection publishes articles in all fields of infection and immunity, covering the different levels of host-microbe interactions.","id_on_source":"MicrobesInfect","tweeter_id":"313054802","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":54976},"tweet_id":"260930773069221888"}]}}
