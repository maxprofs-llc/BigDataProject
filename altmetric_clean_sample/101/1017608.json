However, such evidence exists for several of the frequently associated\/comorbid symptoms such as aggression and severe irritability, hyperactivity, and repetitive behaviors, which can become a major source of additional distress and interference in functioning. This article offers information on the psychopharmacology of ASD that is current, relevant, and organized in a user-friendly manner, to form a concise but informative reference guide for primary pediatric clinicians.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c15","authors":["Kaplan G","McCracken JT"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pcl.2011.10.005","first_seen_on":"2012-10-23T13:15:32+00:00","issns":["0031-3955"],"issue":"1","journal":"Pediatric clinics of North America","last_mentioned_on":1385456862,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22284801?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22284801"],"pmid":"22284801","pubdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Psychopharmacology of autism spectrum disorders.","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/psychopharmacology-autism-spectrum-disorders-23"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629536,"mean":4.93415564694,"rank":1808114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1644625,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629536,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78400,"mean":5.1733879513769,"rank":32273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":41322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78400,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":307,"mean":1.8970392156863,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":307,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.3129090909091,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
