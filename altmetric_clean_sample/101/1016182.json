All conceivable He(n)H(x)(+) stoichiometries are identified if their mass is below the limit of \u2248120 u set by the resolution of the spectrometer. Anomalies in the ion yields of He(n)H(x)(+) for x=1, 2, or 3, and n\u226430 reveal particularly stable cluster ions. Our results for He(n)H(1)(+) are consistent with conclusions drawn from previous experimental and theoretical studies which were limited to smaller cluster ions. The He(n)H(3)(+) series exhibits a pronounced anomaly at n=12 which was outside the reliable range of earlier experiments. Contrary to findings reported for other diatomic dopant molecules, the monomer ion (i.e. H(2)(+)) retains helium with much greater efficiency than hydrogen-cluster ions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dda","authors":["Bartl, Peter","Leidlmair, Christian","Denifl, Stephan","Scheier, Paul","Echt, Olof","Bartl P","Leidlmair C","Denifl S","Scheier P","Echt O"],"doi":"10.1002\/cphc.201200664","endpage":"232","first_seen_on":"2012-10-22T22:07:24+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1439-7641","1439-4235"],"issue":"1","journal":"ChemPhysChem","last_mentioned_on":1486365929,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201200664\/abstract;jsessionid=0CF870DD873D84B8D02CBFB40830D08B.d01t03","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/cphc.201200664"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201200664\/pdf","pmid":"23090688","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
