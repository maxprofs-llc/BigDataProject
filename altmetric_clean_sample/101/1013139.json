Here we report a mass spectrometry analysis of an RNA-affinity complex isolation using a piRNA homologous sequence derived from Alu retrotransposal RNA. Our data point to potential roles for piALU RNAs in DNA repair, cell cycle and chromatin regulations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc6a","authors":["Benjamin J.
