This approach enables safe sample collection, sample containment, integrated sharps disposal, high sample volume capacity, and controlled downstream flow with no electrical power requirements. Sample is manually injected into the device via a syringe and needle. The membrane pump inflates upon injection and subsequently deflates, delivering fluid to downstream components in a controlled manner. The device is fabricated from poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and silicone, using CO2 laser micromachining, with a total material cost of \u223c0.20 USD\/device. We experimentally demonstrate pump performance for both deionized (DI) water and undiluted, anticoagulated mouse whole blood, and characterize the behavior with reference to a resistor-capacitor electrical circuit analogy. Downstream output of the membrane pump is regulated, and scaled, by connecting multiple pumps in parallel. In contrast to existing on-chip pumping mechanisms that typically have low volume capacity (\u223c5\u2009\u03bcL) and sample volume throughput (\u223c1-10\u2009\u03bcl\/min), the membrane pump offers high volume capacity (up to 240\u2009\u03bcl) and sample volume throughput (up to 125\u2009\u03bcl\/min).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51e3cf058f6100039c3","authors":["Sinton, David"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4762851","first_seen_on":"2012-10-19T23:02:31+00:00","issns":["","1932-1058"],"issue":"4","journal":"Biomicrofluidics","last_mentioned_on":1350687652,"links":["http:\/\/bmf.aip.org\/resource\/1\/biomgb\/v6\/i4\/p044102_s1?track=tweet&bypassSSO=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.aip.org\/link\/?BIOMGB\/6\/044102\/1","pmcid":"PMC3487897","pmid":"24143160","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Institute of Physics","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Interdisciplinary Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Classical Physics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Hand-powered microfluidics: A membrane pump with a patient-to-chip syringe interface","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/handpowered-microfluidics-membrane-pump-patienttochip-syringe-interface"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3071197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":948683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81969,"mean":5.5178768299825,"rank":52755,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":16243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81969,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296,"mean":2.8353152542373,"rank":159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
