In this paper, we present a new class of sulfonamide-linked neoglycoconjugate that was designed to selectively target and inhibit the extracellular domains of the cancer-relevant CA isozymes. We describe the application of novel, yet straightforward, chemistry toward the synthesis of inhibitors that comprise both S-glycosyl sulfenamides and S-glycosyl sulfonamides. We also present the CA inhibition profile of our new neoglycoconjugates, more specifically a library of 30 compounds (3-32) that were designed to optimize both SAR (structure-activity relationship) and SPR (structure-property relationship) characteristics. We show that our approach produces neutral, water-soluble, and potent inhibitors (K(i)s in the low nanomolar range) that target cancer-associated CAs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Marie Lopez","Lopez M","Bornaghi LF","Innocenti A","Vullo D","Charman SA","Supuran CT","Poulsen SA"],"doi":"10.1021\/jm901888x","endpage":"2926","first_seen_on":"2012-10-21T05:02:00+00:00","issns":["0022-2623","1520-4804"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1350795701,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jm901888x"],"pmid":"20201556","pubdate":"2010-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2913","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Sulfonamide Linked Neoglycoconjugates\u2212A New Class of Inhibitors for Cancer-Associated Carbonic Anhydrases","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sulfonamide-linked-neoglycoconjugatesa-new-class-inhibitors-cancerassociated-carbonic-anhydrases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628714,"mean":4.9390391673343,"rank":2902415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":76881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628714,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78347,"mean":5.183805733541,"rank":58383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78347,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2707,"mean":3.4038477457502,"rank":2246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2707,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":2.566347826087,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
