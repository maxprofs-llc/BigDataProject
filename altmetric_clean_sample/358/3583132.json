In Study 1, agentic and communal participants read an agentic or a communal vignette consisting of differentiated and integrated statements, performed a distraction task, then completed written recall and recognition tasks. Agentics recalled and recognized more differentiation in the agentic story; communals recalled and recognized more integration in the communal story. A computerized replication with randomized recognition items (Study 2) found the same pattern of recognition results. Studies 3 and 4 used implicit motive primes and found similar results in both written and computerized recognition tasks. These ways of organizing information have powerful implications for the encoding of autobiographical knowledge and its long-term organization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037a6","authors":["B Woike","E Lavezzary","J Barsky"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T08:38:48+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0022-3514"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Personality & Social Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1309284534,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11708568"],"pmid":"11708568","pubdate":"2001-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Marketing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"The influence of implicit motives on memory processes.","type":"article","volume":"81","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-implicit-motives-memory-processes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632140,"mean":4.9249633348334,"rank":816015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2293800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632140,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95840,"mean":8.257017811121,"rank":25036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95840,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2341,"mean":9.8929102564103,"rank":1149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2341,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":13.248941176471,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
