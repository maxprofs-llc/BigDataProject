The predator was highly efficient in controlling mosquitoes in all three settings, reaching close to 90% reduction in larval survival under field conditions and exceeding the recommended predation rates for effective mosquito control in laboratory experiments. The predator was most effective on 1-4-d-old larvae. Alternate food and habitat structure significantly influenced the predation rates on mosquito larvae. Once established, the copepod was able to maintain reproducing populations in the field for the duration of the experiments. However, the predator failed to establish populations at four of the experimental field sites. Two of the failures can be attributed to characteristics of the individual tires, such as leaching chemicals, whereas the other two were probably due to site-specific factors. This copepod species is a promising candidate for control of mosquito larvae because it is a widespread and highly effective predator that is capable of establishing and maintaining populations under a wide variety of field conditions. Additionally, M. albidus is relatively easy to culture, maintain, and deliver to the target areas.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006672","authors":["Rey JR","O'Connell S","Su\u00e1rez S","Men\u00e9ndez Z","Lounibos LP","Byer G"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T12:37:46+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Vector Ecology","last_mentioned_on":1240227134,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15266749"],"pmid":"15266749","pubdate":"2004-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Laboratory and field studies of Macrocyclops albidus (Crustacea: Copepoda) for biological control of mosquitoes in artificial containers in a subtropical environment.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laboratory-field-studies-macrocyclops-albidus-crustacea-copepoda-biological-control-mosquitoes-artif"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628014,"mean":4.9445414826282,"rank":817330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628014,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95082,"mean":8.1879293444538,"rank":24695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95082,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":2.7220819672131,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
