Although these disorders still lack an effective treatment, new antibody-based strategies are emerging and entering clinical trials. The intrabody approach is a gene-based technology developed to neutralize or modify the function of intracellular and extracellular target antigens. Because intrabodies can potentially target all the different isoforms of a misfolding-prone protein, including pathological conformations, they are emerging as therapeutic molecules for the treatment of misfolding diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and prion diseases. This review will provide a description of the intrabody approach, an update of preclinical studies on misfolding diseases and an outlook on the intrabody delivery issue for therapeutic purposes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036b0","doi":"10.1016\/j.molmed.2008.07.004","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T08:12:45+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Trends in Molecular Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1271837913,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.molmed.2008.07.004","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18693139"],"pmid":"18693139","pubdate":"2008-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"The potential of intracellular antibodies for therapeutic targeting of protein-misfolding diseases.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-intracellular-antibodies-therapeutic-targeting-proteinmisfolding-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4510149,"mean":5.2636614770391,"rank":1037560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2908674,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4510149,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152819,"mean":8.9413319373376,"rank":44719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":106213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152819,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":504,"mean":4.6462504970179,"rank":160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":504,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":5.6709230769231,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
