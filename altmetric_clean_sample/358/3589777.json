Many studies have been conducted to date in terms of the differentiation potential of these cells, with several reports demonstrating that cells from both the amniotic fluid and membrane display high plasticity. In addition, cells from the amniotic membrane have also been shown to display immunomodulatory characteristics both in vivo and in vitro, which could make them useful in an allotransplantation setting. Here, we provide an overview comparing the latest findings regarding the stem characteristics of cells from both the amniotic membrane and amniotic fluid, as well as on the potential utility of these cells for future clinical application in regenerative medicine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6363cf058f61000871a","authors":["Ornella Parolini"],"doi":"10.2217\/17460751.4.2.275","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T12:47:59+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Regenerative Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1386910374,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2217\/17460751.4.2.275","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19317646"],"pmid":"19317646","pubdate":"2009-03-26T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Amniotic membrane and amniotic fluid-derived cells: potential tools for regenerative medicine?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/amniotic-membrane-amniotic-fluidderived-cells-potential-tools-regenerative-medicine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628259,"mean":4.9430875566221,"rank":817206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287940,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628259,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95144,"mean":8.2057017121597,"rank":24723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95144,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206,"mean":4.757756097561,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":2.5833333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
