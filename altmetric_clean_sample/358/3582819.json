We extend the MLLR, EIBD, AIBS and IBS tests for detection of misspecified relationships to a broader range of relative pairs, and we improve the two-stage screening procedure for analyzing large data sets. We have developed software, PREST, which calculates the test statistics and performs the corresponding hypothesis tests for relationship misclassification in general outbred pedigrees. When a potential pedigree error is detected, our companion program, ALTERTEST, can be used to determine which relationships are compatible with the genotype data. Both programs are now freely available on the web.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f61000767b","authors":["Sun, L.","Wilder, K.","McPeek, M.S."],"doi":"10.1159\/000067666","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T08:20:07+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1423-0062","0001-5652"],"issue":"2","journal":"Human Heredity","last_mentioned_on":1408094483,"links":["http:\/\/content.karger.com\/ProdukteDB\/produkte.asp?Doi=67666","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1159\/000067666","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12566741"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/Pdf\/67666","pmid":"12566741","pubdate":"2003-01-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Karger Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Enhanced pedigree error detection.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enhanced-pedigree-error-detection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4143352,"mean":5.1107237333896,"rank":965288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2615346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4143352,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134479,"mean":9.1707197905979,"rank":41626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":90954,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134479,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176,"mean":2.4810971428571,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":24.095333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
