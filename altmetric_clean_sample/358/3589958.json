At the time that these L-phase variants were recovered in large numbers from the lung, there was a correspondingly enhanced inflammation leading to alveolar consolidation and animal death. During the peak of this response (at 1 week after infection), normal nocardial cells were neither isolated from nor seen within the lung. It is suggested that the conversion of these normal nocardial cells to their L-phase variant leads to this extensive pulmonary damage. Furthermore, the L-phase organisms appear to play an active role in this pathological effect since introduction of similar amounts of killed nocardial cells into the lungs of the mice failed to produce a similar response.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007771","authors":["B L Beaman"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T12:52:46+00:00","issns":["0019-9567"],"issue":"1","journal":"Infection and Immunity","last_mentioned_on":1237228290,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7399704","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC551102"],"pmcid":"PMC551102","pmid":"7399704","pubdate":"1980-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["communicablediseases","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Induction of L-phase variants of Nocardia caviae within intact murine lungs.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/induction-lphase-variants-nocardia-caviae-within-intact-murine-lungs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628496,"mean":4.94108381299,"rank":817080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628496,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95195,"mean":8.2074691051959,"rank":24744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95195,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1725,"mean":3.1933758700696,"rank":224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":1102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1725,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.8556428571429,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"L-form bacteria","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=277692426#altmetric_citation_1","license":"public","citation_ids":[3589958],"posted_on":"2009-03-16T18:31:30+00:00","summary":"L-form bacteria, also known as L-phase bacteria, L-phase variants, and cell wall-deficient (CWD) bacteria, are strains of bacteria that lack cell walls.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=21975254","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"TimVickers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:TimVickers"}}]}}
