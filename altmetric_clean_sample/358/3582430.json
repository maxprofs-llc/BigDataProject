One group was given arginine tidiacicate (ATCA) at the dose of 400 mg tablets three times a day and the other given a placebo, both for 30 days. The group of patients receiving ATCA showed a clear-cut improvement of subjective symptoms and of the most important cytolysis and cholestasis parameters studied, such modifications being greater than in the placebo group. Drug tolerance was excellent, since no side-effects were observed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000cee7","authors":["S Rizzo"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T07:58:25+00:00","issns":["0251-1649"],"issue":"3","journal":"International journal of clinical pharmacology research","last_mentioned_on":1338301646,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3527997"],"pmid":"3527997","pubdate":"1986-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Clinical trial with arginine tidiacicate in symptomatic chronic persistent hepatitis.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/symptomatic-chronic-persistent-hepatitis-clinical-trial-arginine-thiazolidinecarboxylate-sulfile"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3990951,"mean":5.0361453117237,"rank":917278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3990951,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127065,"mean":9.1692842965192,"rank":38756,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":86716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127065,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":2.9625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Tidiacic","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=494957633#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3582430],"posted_on":"2012-05-29T14:27:26+00:00","summary":"Tidiacic is a hepatoprotective drug.
