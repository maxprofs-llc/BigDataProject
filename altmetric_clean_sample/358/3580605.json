For malignant gliomas, paclitaxel is prevented from reaching its target by the presence of the efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at the blood-brain barrier. We investigated the utilization of a new drug delivery system to increase brain delivery of paclitaxel.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002450","authors":["A R\u00e9gina","M Demeule","C Ch\u00e9","I Lavall\u00e9e","J Poirier","R Gabathuler","R B\u00e9liveau","J-P Castaigne"],"doi":"10.1038\/bjp.2008.260","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T06:51:30+00:00","issns":["1476-5381"],"issue":"2","journal":"British Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1281974444,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2538693\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/bjp.2008.260","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18574456","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2538693"],"pmid":"18574456","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"185","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Antitumour activity of ANG1005, a conjugate between paclitaxel and the new brain delivery vector Angiopep-2","type":"article","volume":"155","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antitumour-activity-ang1005-conjugate-between-paclitaxel-new-brain-delivery-vector-angiopep2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627387,"mean":4.9489064262842,"rank":817679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286362,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627387,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94922,"mean":8.1602786949148,"rank":24636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94922,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1701,"mean":3.4175929411765,"rank":292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1701,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.2983870967742,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":34,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
