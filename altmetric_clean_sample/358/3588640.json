Histopathological findings revealed that S. iniae type II produces a systemic disease, including a diffuse necrotizing myositis. The distribution of viable bacteria in infected tissues substantiated the pathological findings, confirming that S. iniae type II is responsible for a generalized septic disease of rainbow trout.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000714c","authors":["Lahav D","Eyngor M","Hurvitz A","Ghittino C","Lublin A","Eldar A"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T12:15:40+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Diseases of Aquatic Organisms","last_mentioned_on":1241491200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15648844"],"pmid":"15648844","pubdate":"2005-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Streptococcus iniae type II infections in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss.","type":"article","volume":"62","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/streptococcus-iniae-type-ii-infections-rainbow-trout-oncorhynchus-mykiss-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4510149,"mean":5.2636614770391,"rank":1037560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2908706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4510149,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152819,"mean":8.9413319373376,"rank":44719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":106213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152819,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215,"mean":2.4344112149533,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
