Although both dimensions appear to influence memory, they may do so via distinct mechanisms. The amygdala likely plays a specific role in modulating memory for arousing experiences, whereas non-amygdalar networks may be instrumental in enhancing memory for non-arousing positive or negative events.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6363cf058f610008783","authors":["Kensinger EA"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T08:33:34+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Reviews in the Neurosciences","last_mentioned_on":1316633504,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15526549"],"pmid":"15526549","pubdate":"2003-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Remembering emotional experiences: the contribution of valence and arousal.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/remembering-emotional-experiences-contribution-valence-arousal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629591,"mean":4.9337473984712,"rank":816400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629591,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95395,"mean":8.2287949975892,"rank":24816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69497,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95395,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":2.5497959183673,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.739,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":12,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Researcher":43,"Student  > Ph.
