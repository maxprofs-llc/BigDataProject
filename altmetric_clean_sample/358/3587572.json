When combined with other data, in particular from the Robotic Telescope and Transient Source Experiment (ROTSE) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), evidence emerges for a smoothly declining light curve, suggesting some color dependence that could be related to a cooling break passing the ultraviolet-optical band at about 1 day after the high-energy event. The steeper decline rate seen after 1.5 to 2 days may be evidence for a collimated jet pointing toward the observer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1999Sci...283.2069C","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Alberto J.
