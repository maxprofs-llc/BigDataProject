Such estimates often accord with those provided by the remember-know procedure, and both methods are now widely used in the neuroscience literature to identify the brain correlates of recollection and familiarity. However, in recent years, a substantial literature has accumulated directly contrasting the signal-detection model against the threshold\/detection model, and that literature is almost unanimous in its endorsement of signal-detection theory. A dual-process version of signal-detection theory implies that individual recognition decisions are not process pure, and it suggests new ways to investigate the brain correlates of recognition memory.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033dd","authors":["Wixted JT"],"doi":"10.1037\/0033-295x.114.1.152","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T08:32:25+00:00","issns":["0033-295X","1939-1471"],"issue":"1","journal":"Psychological Review","last_mentioned_on":1304891344,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17227185","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1037\/0033-295X.114.1.152"],"pmid":"17227185","pubdate":"2007-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology","Arts and Humanities"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Dual-process theory and signal-detection theory of recognition memory.","type":"article","volume":"114","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dualprocess-theory-signaldetection-theory-recognition-memory"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632299,"mean":4.9243828402896,"rank":816005,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632299,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95864,"mean":8.261359356582,"rank":25048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95864,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":582,"mean":5.5356110154905,"rank":159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":582,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":8,"Professor > Associate Professor":33,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":29,"Researcher":88,"Student  > Ph.
