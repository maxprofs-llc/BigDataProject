Horsley and Clarke's primate stereotaxy at the turn of the 20th century and events surrounding it are described, including Mussen's development of a human version of the apparatus. Stereotactic surgery after the Second World War is reviewed, with an emphasis on the pioneering work of Gillingham, Hitchcock, Knight, and Watkins and the contributions from Bennett, Gleave, Hughes, Johnson, McKissock, McCaul, and Dutton after the influences of Dott, Cairns, and Jefferson. Forster's introduction of gamma knife radiosurgery is summarized, as is the application of computed tomography by Hounsfield and Ambrose. Contemporary contributions to the present day from Bartlett, Richardson, Miles, Thomas, Gill, Aziz, Hariz, and others are summarized. The current status of British stereotactic neurosurgery is discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082b6","authors":["Pereira EA","Green AL","Nandi D","Aziz TZ"],"doi":"10.1227\/01.neu.0000316854.29571.40","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T09:44:11+00:00","issns":["0148-396X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Neurosurgery","last_mentioned_on":1453480055,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/neurosurgery\/Fulltext\/2008\/09000\/Stereotactic_Neurosurgery_in_the_United_Kingdom_.23.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/neurosurgery\/Fulltext\/2008\/09000\/STEREOTACTIC_NEUROSURGERY_IN_THE_UNITED_KINGDOM_.23.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/neurosurgery\/2008\/09000\/STEREOTACTIC_NEUROSURGERY_IN_THE_UNITED_KINGDOM_.23.pdf","pmid":"18812971","pubdate":"2008-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"594","subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"STEREOTACTIC NEUROSURGERY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM: THE HUNDRED YEARS FROM HORSLEY TO HARIZ","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stereotactic-neurosurgery-united-kingdom-hundred-years-horsley-hariz"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7007649,"mean":6.258769735863,"rank":1576429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5401198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7007649,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234817,"mean":8.0871201962389,"rank":62963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":170717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234817,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1733,"mean":5.1393256351039,"rank":362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":1363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1733,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":8.5343018867925,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Other":7,"Student  > Master":2,"Professor":5},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":13,"Neuroscience":4,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1,"CH":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Francis Gillingham","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=271617417#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3584553],"posted_on":"2009-02-18T18:13:08+00:00","summary":"Prof. Francis &quot;John&quot; Gillingham, CBE, MBE(Mil.)
