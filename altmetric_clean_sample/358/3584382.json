Our aim is to identify the key molecules involved in the pathogenesis of AAAs. This study investigated transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of macrophages from AAA patients (>50 mm aortic diameter) (n = 24) and peripheral arterial occlusion (PAO) patients without AAA detected (n = 18), who both needed a surgery. An antibody protein microarray, generated by printing antibodies onto membranes against proteins selected from the transcriptomic and proteomic analysis, was performed to validate the proteins differentially expressed specifically in macrophages and plasma from the same patients. We found a restricted number of proteins differentially expressed between AAA and PAO patients: TIMP-3, ADAMTS5, and ADAMTS8 that differ significantly in plasma of AAA patients compared to PAO patients, as found in the macrophages. In contrast to plasma MMP-9, soluble glycoprotein V (sGPV) and plasmin-antiplasmin complex levels, plasma TIMP-3 levels were not correlated to AAA size but interestingly correlated to sGPV, a platelet activation marker. Combining transcriptomic and proteomic is a valid approach to identify diseases causing proteins and potential biomarkers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e0f","authors":["Lamblin N","Ratajczak P","Hot D","Dubois E","Chwastyniak M","Beseme O","Drobecq H","Lemoine Y","Koussa M","Amouyel P","Pinet F"],"doi":"10.1021\/pr100250s","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T09:37:02+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","last_mentioned_on":1410190953,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20513153","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/pr100250s"],"pmid":"20513153","pubdate":"2010-02-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Profile of macrophages in human abdominal aortic aneurysms: a transcriptomic, proteomic, and antibody protein array study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/profile-macrophages-human-abdominal-aortic-aneurysms-transcriptomic-proteomic-antibody-protein-array-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4724476,"mean":5.6951346649109,"rank":1143314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2991846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4724476,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167897,"mean":8.9259500643259,"rank":50028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":115652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167897,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2165,"mean":2.901561922366,"rank":327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":1716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2165,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":2.9932653061224,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
