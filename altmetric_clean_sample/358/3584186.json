Extensive surgical debridement helped two patients recover from their infections. The underlying disease in the one patient who died was diabetes mellitus. We reviewed the literature on primary cutaneous zygomycosis and found that S. vasiformis and A. elegans were the etiologic agents in 16 and 13 earlier cases, respectively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255e","authors":["A.
