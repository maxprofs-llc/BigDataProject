An important task in this challenge is to identify regulatory elements, especially the binding sites in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for transcription factors. These binding sites are short DNA segments that are called motifs. Recent advances in genome sequence availability and in high-throughput gene expression analysis technologies have allowed for the development of computational methods for motif finding. As a result, a large number of motif finding algorithms have been implemented and applied to various motif models over the past decade. This survey reviews the latest developments in DNA motif finding algorithms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","authors":["Modan K Das","Ho-Kwok Dai"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2105-8-s7-s21","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T12:14:06+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1471-2105","14712105"],"issue":"Suppl 7","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1477945944,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2105-8-S7-S21","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18047721","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2099490"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2105-8-S7-S21.pdf","pmcid":"PMC2099490","pmid":"18047721","pubdate":"2007-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Algorithms","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Combinatorial Libraries","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computational Biology\/Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computer Appl. in Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"S21","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"A survey of DNA motif finding algorithms","type":"article","volume":"8 Suppl 7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/survey-dna-motif-finding-algorithms-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7625034,"mean":6.5623772256419,"rank":1582243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5990680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7625034,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239543,"mean":8.1924991108032,"rank":57981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":180651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239543,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3413,"mean":4.9392678780774,"rank":1072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":2292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3413,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144,"mean":4.2513566433566,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":28,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":123,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Student  > Ph.
