Treatment largely depends on the type and extent of the injury with arthroscopic repair or meniscectomy being mainstays. Although non-surgical approaches have been described, there is no published literature regarding a combination of indirect osteopathic techniques and rehabilitation in the management of these injuries. The current case report follows a 20-year-old male presenting with a 5-day history of acute knee pain, following trauma during an Australian Rules Football (AFL) match. An 8-week management plan of indirect osteopathic techniques and a tailored rehabilitation program was implemented. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) questionnaires were utilised to measure outcomes. After the 8-week treatment and rehabilitation program, the patient had exceeded the minimum detectable change score for all outcome measures. This case report suggests that osteopathic manipulative treatment and rehabilitation may be an alternative, non-surgical approach in the management of post-traumatic meniscal injuries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000582a","authors":["Jack Feehan","Chris Macfarlane","Brett Vaughan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ctim.2017.05.007","first_seen_on":"2017-07-15T07:27:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["09652299","1873-6963"],"journal":"Complementary Therapies in Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1500991902,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0965229917301322","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28735822"],"pmid":"28735822","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Health Professions"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Conservative management of a traumatic meniscal injury utilising osteopathy and exercise rehabilitation: A case report","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conservative-management-traumatic-meniscal-injury-utilising-osteopathy-exercise-rehabilitation-case"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272105,"mean":6.9807941447478,"rank":5980966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1996211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272105,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206144,"mean":11.562059647914,"rank":133135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":60794,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206144,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":655,"mean":7.5973639143731,"rank":515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":655,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":3.9576923076923,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BrettVaughan4\/statuses\/886112436834582528","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21915930],"posted_on":"2017-07-15T06:37:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Brett Vaughan","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/6dztfzTQzN","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/465013560326623233\/lWGLDypk_normal.jpeg","description":"Osteopath, academic, clinical educator and researcher.
