Primary (BMI value at the 95th percentile [%BMIp95 ]) and secondary outcomes were measured at baseline, 3 months (Intensive Phase), and 12 months (Transition Phase).\nFor age group 6-8, MEND\/CATCH6-12 resulted in greater improvement in %BMIp95 than Next Steps during the Intensive Phase. Effect size (95% CI) was -1.94 (-3.88, -0.01) percentage points (P\u2009=\u20090.05). For age group 9-12, effect size was -1.38 (-2.87, 0.16) percentage points for %BMIp95 (P\u2009=\u20090.07). MEND2-5 did not differentially affect %BMIp95 . Attendance averaged 52% and 22% during the Intensive and Transition Phases. Intervention compliance was inversely correlated to change in %BMIp95 during the Intensive Phase (P\u2009<\u20090.05). In the Transition Phase, %BMIp95 was maintained or rebounded in both programs (P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nMEND\/CATCH6-12 was more efficacious for BMI reduction at 3 months but not 12 months compared to Next Steps in underserved children. Intervention compliance influenced outcomes, emphasizing the need for research in sustaining family engagement in low-income populations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000834f","authors":["Butte, Nancy F.","Hoelscher, Deanna M.","Barlow, Sarah E.","Pont, Stephen","Durand, Casey","Vandewater, Elizabeth A.","Liu, Yan","Adolph, Anne L.","P\u00e9rez, Adriana","Wilson, Theresa A.","Gonzalez, Alejandra","Puyau, Maurice R.","Sharma, Shreela V.","Byrd\u2010Williams, Courtney","Oluyomi, Abiodun","Huang, Terry","Finkelstein, Eric A.","Sacher, Paul M.","Kelder, Steven H."],"doi":"10.1002\/oby.21929","first_seen_on":"2017-07-15T07:36:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1930-7381","1930-739X"],"journal":"Obesity","last_mentioned_on":1500319801,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/oby.21929\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/oby.21929\/full","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/oby.21929\/full?utm_content=buffer3fe4a&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/oby.21929\/pdf","pmid":"28703504","pubdate":"2017-07-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","physiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Efficacy of a community- versus primary care-centered program for childhood obesity: TX CORD RCT","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-community-versus-primary-carecentered-program-childhood-obesity-tx-cord-rct"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":3.45,"6m":3.45,"3m":3.45,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223669,"mean":6.9683210333815,"rank":1984528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6229289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223669,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184780,"mean":11.501792952662,"rank":55494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":128843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184780,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2406,"mean":21.241372141372,"rank":1179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2406,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":17.267692307692,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"CM":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/drpaulsacher\/statuses\/886114336128864256","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21916200],"posted_on":"2017-07-15T06:44:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Paul Sacher","url":"https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/in\/drpaulsacher","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/443102095575502849\/2XDPjHdG_normal.jpeg","description":"Digital health director.
