In the mammalian retina, excitatory amino-acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) is expressed in neural cells, including RGCs. Loss of EAAC1 leads to RGC degeneration without elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and exhibits glaucomatous pathology including glutamate neurotoxicity and oxidative stress. In the present study, we found that edaravone, a free radical scavenger that is used for treatment of acute brain infarction and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), reduces oxidative stress and prevents RGC death and thinning of the inner retinal layer in EAAC1-deficient (KO) mice. In addition, in vivo electrophysiological analyses demonstrated that visual impairment in EAAC1 KO mice was ameliorated with edaravone treatment, clearly establishing that edaravone beneficially affects both histological and functional aspects of the glaucomatous retina. Our findings raise intriguing possibilities for the management of glaucoma by utilizing a widely prescribed drug for the treatment of acute brain infarction and ALS, edaravone, in combination with conventional treatments to lower IOP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e18","authors":["Kei Akaiwa","Kazuhiko Namekata","Yuriko Azuchi","Xiaoli Guo","Atsuko Kimura","Chikako Harada","Yoshinori Mitamura","Takayuki Harada","Akaiwa, Kei","Namekata, Kazuhiko","Azuchi, Yuriko","Guo, Xiaoli","Kimura, Atsuko","Harada, Chikako","Mitamura, Yoshinori","Harada, Takayuki"],"doi":"10.1038\/cddis.2017.341","first_seen_on":"2017-07-15T06:43:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2041-4889","false"],"issue":"7","journal":"Cell Death & Disease","last_mentioned_on":1500981014,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/cddis\/journal\/v8\/n7\/full\/cddis2017341a.html","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28703795?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/cddis\/journal\/v8\/n7\/full\/cddis2017341a.html?foxtrotcallback=true"],"pmid":"28703795","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"e2934","subjects":["cellbiology","internalmedicine"],"title":"Edaravone suppresses retinal ganglion cell death in a mouse model of normal tension glaucoma","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/edaravone-suppresses-retinal-ganglion-cell-death-mouse-model-normal-tension-glaucoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":5980960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1996185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206123,"mean":11.562748090936,"rank":133132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":60777,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206123,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1538,"mean":5.5167586206897,"rank":1105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1538,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":2.6955752212389,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
