Study children provided data on a range of bladder and bowel symptoms at age 14 (data available for 5899 participants).\nSelf-reported bladder and bowel symptoms at 14\u2005years including daytime wetting, bedwetting, nocturia, urgency, frequent urination, low voided volume, voiding postponement, passing hard stools and low stool frequency.\nWe extracted 5 trajectories of urinary incontinence from 4 to 9\u2005years using longitudinal latent class analysis: (1) normative development of daytime and night-time bladder control (63.0% of the sample), (2) delayed attainment of bladder control (8.6%), (3) bedwetting alone (no daytime wetting) (15.6%), (4) daytime wetting alone (no bedwetting) (5.8%) and (5) persistent wetting (bedwetting with daytime wetting to age 9) (7.0%). The persistent wetting class generally showed the strongest associations with the adolescent bladder and bowel symptoms: OR for bedwetting at 14\u2005years=23.5, 95% CI (15.1 to 36.5), daytime wetting (6.98 (4.50 to 10.8)), nocturia (2.39 (1.79 to 3.20)), urgency (2.10 (1.44 to 3.07)) and passing hard stools (2.64 (1.63 to 4.27)) (reference category=normative development). The association with adolescent bedwetting was weaker for children with bedwetting alone (3.69 (2.21 to 6.17)).\nTrajectories of childhood urinary incontinence are differentially associated with adolescent bladder and bowel symptoms. Children exhibiting persistent bedwetting with daytime wetting had the poorest outcomes in adolescence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Jon Heron","Mariusz T Grzeda","Alexander von Gontard","Anne Wright","Carol Joinson"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-014238","first_seen_on":"2017-03-15T09:46:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"3","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1494274177,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/7\/3\/e014238","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-014238","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/7\/3\/e014238?hootPostID=ab805fdf88e2639437e247313b5e6e1c","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/7\/3\/e014238?rss=1","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/7\/3\/e014238?hootPostID=be313976bad5eb273965640a65551752","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/7\/3\/e014238.long","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-014238"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/bmjopen\/7\/3\/e014238.full.pdf","pmid":"28292756","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","startpage":"e014238","title":"Trajectories of urinary incontinence in childhood and bladder and bowel symptoms in adolescence: prospective cohort study","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trajectories-urinary-incontinence-childhood-bladder-bowel-symptoms-adolescence-prospective-cohort-st"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.35,"score_history":{"1y":14.35,"6m":14.35,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172783,"mean":6.915960179526,"rank":576052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7595364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172783,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235931,"mean":13.690914906964,"rank":29828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":206039,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235931,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5945,"mean":16.928364064603,"rank":1171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5945,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":386,"mean":15.087018181818,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":386,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2,"US":2,"MX":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Untreated childhood urinary problems may persist into teens","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=29902502154&p=1pl&v=1&x=hQlPPvEIrLBlle6XELk1jQ","license":"public","citation_ids":[17361920,17361920],"posted_on":"2017-03-15T08:40:59+00:00","summary":"It is, therefore, vital that clinicians are able to identify those at risk of ongoing bladder and bowel issues and ensure they get the right help, said the study authors.","author":{"name":"Nursing Times","url":"http:\/\/www.nursingtimes.net","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/562\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2016-02-02_at_17.00.12.png?1454432423"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BMJ_Open\/statuses\/844913450472165377","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17361920],"posted_on":"2017-03-23T14:07:18+00:00","author":{"name":"BMJ_Open","url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/784380669099118595\/K5c_Gj4b_normal.jpg","description":"BMJ Open is an open access, general medical journal publishing research across all medical disciplines and therapeutic areas.","id_on_source":"BMJ_Open","tweeter_id":"177891462","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":10912},"tweet_id":"844913450472165377"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IFFGD\/statuses\/845001347271405568","license":"gnip","rt":["BMJ_Open"],"citation_ids":[17361920],"posted_on":"2017-03-23T19:56:35+00:00","author":{"name":"IFFGD","url":"http:\/\/iffgd.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/624602937776476161\/wQE3D0T4_normal.png","description":"Our mission: to support, inform, and assist people with digestive disorders.
