Moreover, a control (pet.) patch and an irritant (SLS) patch were applied. After 3\u2009days, the stratum corneum from tested sites was collected, and NMF levels and corneocyte morphology, expressed as the amount of circular nanosize objects, quantified according to the Dermal Texture Index (DTI), were determined.\nAmong allergens, only MCI\/MI reduced NMF levels significantly, as did SLS. Furthermore, only MCI\/MI caused remarkable changes at the microscopic level; the corneocytes were hexagonal-shaped with pronounced cell borders and a smoother surface. The DTI was increased after SLS exposure but not after allergen exposure.\nMCI\/MI significantly decreased NMF levels, similarly to SLS. The altered corneocyte morphology suggests that skin barrier damage plays a role in the pathogenesis of MCI\/MI contact allergy. The DTI seems to differentiate reactions to SLS from those to the allergens tested, as SLS was the only agent that caused a DTI increase.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000260f","authors":["Koppes, Sjors A.","Ljubojevi\u0107 Had\u017eavdi\u0107, Suzana","Jakasa, Ivone","Franceschi, Nika","Riethm\u00fcller, Christoph","Juraki\u0107 Ton\u010dic, Ru\u017eica","Marinovic, Branka","Raj, Nidhin","Rawlings, Anthony V.","Voegeli, Rainer","Lane, Majella E.","Haftek, Marek","Frings\u2010Dresen, Monique H.W.","Rustemeyer, Thomas","Kezic, Sanja"],"doi":"10.1111\/cod.12770","endpage":"295","first_seen_on":"2017-03-15T08:15:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0105-1873","1600-0536","01051873"],"issue":"5","journal":"Contact Dermatitis (01051873)","last_mentioned_on":1491725846,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/wol1\/doi\/10.1111\/cod.12770\/full","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cod.12770\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cod.12770\/pdf","pmid":"28295421","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"287","subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Effect of allergens and irritants on levels of natural moisturizing factor and corneocyte morphology","type":"article","volume":"76","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-allergens-irritants-levels-natural-moisturizing-factor-corneocyte-morphology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029393,"mean":6.8051641093086,"rank":6092831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1079955,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029393,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231956,"mean":13.560428746955,"rank":167856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":39889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231956,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1286,"mean":3.0292031128405,"rank":1097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1286,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.2133333333333,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
