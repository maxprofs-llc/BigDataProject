A number of concerns have been raised regarding the risk of de novo GERD or exacerbation of preexisting GERD after sleeve gastrectomy (SG).\nTo assess PPI use at 4 years after bariatric surgery.\nFrench National Health Insurance.\nData were extracted from the French National Health Insurance database. All adult obese patients who had undergone gastric bypass (GBP) (n = 8250) or SG (n = 11,923) in 2011 in France were included. Patients were considered to be on continuous PPI therapy when PPIs were dispensed\u22656 times per year. Logistic regression models were used to compute odds ratios for potential risk factors for PPI reimbursement 4 years after surgery.\nOverall, continuous use of PPIs increased from baseline to 4 years after SG and GBP, from 10.9% to 26.5% (P<.001) and from 11.4% to 21.9% (P<.001), respectively. Among patients who underwent PPI therapy before surgery, those who had undergone SG were more likely to continue PPI therapy 4 years after surgery compared with those who underwent GBP (72.7% versus 59.2%; P<.001). In multivariate analyses, the major risk factors for persistent continuous PPI treatment 4 years after surgery were the following: SG (odds ratio [OR] = 1.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.55-2.25), higher body mass index (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.35-2.5), and preoperative antidepressant treatment (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.56-2.29).\nAt a nationwide scale, continuous PPI treatment is used by 1 of 10 obese patients before bariatric surgery, but by 1 of 4 patients 4 years after surgery. SG compared with GBP, higher body mass index, and other coexisting conditions are the 3 major risk factors for medium-term continuous PPI therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008a99","authors":["J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Thereaux","Thomas Lesuffleur","S\u00e9bastien Czernichow","Arnaud Basdevant","Simon Msika","David Nocca","Bertrand Millat","Anne Fagot-Campagna"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.soard.2016.12.013","first_seen_on":"2017-03-15T11:46:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["15507289"],"journal":"Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1489578006,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1550728916308772"],"pmid":"28223087","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"Do sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass influence treatment with proton pump inhibitors 4 years after surgery?
