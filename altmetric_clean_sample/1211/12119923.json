Often the material on which feedback is sought concerns past cases. When the material relates to current cases, particular safeguards are needed to protect important interests. This paper lists the interests that must be protected when feedback is provided through clinical consultation and supervision meetings in a forensic psychiatric training program. These are the interests of the person being evaluated, the attorneys, the people providing feedback to the evaluator, and the employers of the people providing feedback. The principles that the training program applies in determining attendance at, and participation in, these meetings are described. Finally, scenarios are presented that illustrate the application of these principles. Such application has allowed trainees and others to receive the benefits of consultation and supervision in the course of developing their opinions while protecting the interests of those involved.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5f53cf058f610005e78","authors":["Buchanan, Alec","Norko, Michael","Baranoski, Madelon","Zonana, Howard"],"first_seen_on":"2016-09-21T12:36:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1943-3662"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry & the Law","last_mentioned_on":1474472270,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27644862?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27644862?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27644862","pubdate":"2016-09-21T22:25:54+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Law","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry","jurisprudence"],"title":"A Consultation and Supervision Model for Developing the Forensic Psychiatric Opinion.","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/consultation-supervision-model-developing-forensic-psychiatric-opinion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":7272181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253737,"mean":12.663840101522,"rank":209590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253737,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300,"mean":4.0484414715719,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.42857142857143,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/778573586495713280","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12119923],"posted_on":"2016-09-21T12:36:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":974},"tweet_id":"778573586495713280"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/778618591281381376","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12119923],"posted_on":"2016-09-21T15:35:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":974},"tweet_id":"778618591281381376"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/778619253842780160","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12119923],"posted_on":"2016-09-21T15:37:50+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":974},"tweet_id":"778619253842780160"}]}}
