In a medical center in Taiwan, we performed a chart review of 26 forensic psychiatric evaluations of enlisted personnel who were absent without leave (AWOL) or deserted their service from 1994 to 2014. The findings showed that many of these recruits had a lower level of education (50.00% had just nine years of education), intellectual disability (46.15%), depressive disorders (30.76%), and suicidal ideation (53.85%). Depressive disorder was overrepresented in comparison with findings in a previous study. Further study is needed to confirm whether psychiatric screening before service enlistment and early psychiatric intervention for service members with mental illness or emotional disturbance could help in the prevention of desertion or going AWOL.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5f53cf058f610005e78","authors":["Tzeng, Nian-Sheng","Chen, Chih-Kang","Wang, Tzong-Shi","Chang, Hsin-An","Kao, Yu-Chen","Yeh, Hui-Wen","Chiang, Wei-Shan","Huang, San-Yuan"],"first_seen_on":"2016-09-21T10:44:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1943-3662"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry & the Law","last_mentioned_on":1502598487,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27644869?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27644869?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27644869","pubdate":"2016-09-21T22:25:52+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Law","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry","jurisprudence"],"title":"Forensic Psychiatric Evaluation for Military Absenteeism in Taiwan.","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/forensic-psychiatric-evaluation-military-absenteeism-taiwan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":7232103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253264,"mean":12.63075849216,"rank":209761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253264,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299,"mean":4.0561543624161,"rank":176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.44642857142857,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1,"Unspecified":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/778545351947018243","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12117741],"posted_on":"2016-09-21T10:44:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":976},"tweet_id":"778545351947018243"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/778619177623883776","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12117741],"posted_on":"2016-09-21T15:37:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":976},"tweet_id":"778619177623883776"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/778619925795442688","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12117741],"posted_on":"2016-09-21T15:40:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":976},"tweet_id":"778619925795442688"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/896589155873849344","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12117741],"posted_on":"2017-08-13T04:28:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":976},"tweet_id":"896589155873849344"}]}}
