Here, we derived rabbit ES-like (rES-like) cells from blastocysts of super-ovulated Japanese white rabbits using 10(-7) \u2009M melatonin, 10\u2009ng\/mL basic fibroblast growth factor, and 1000 IU\/mL human leukemia inhibitory factor in the culture medium. This concentration of melatonin had the most significant positive effects on the proliferation inner cell mass-derived cells (improving rates from 19.97% to 34.57%) and the longevity of passaging rES-like cells. Melatonin also enhanced the expression of pluripotent genes -, including alkaline phosphatase, Pou5f1, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, Nanog, Line28a, and surface marker proteins - in fifth-passage rES-like cells. In vitro, these rES-likc cells could spontaneously differentiate into some somatic cells, such as beating cardiomyocytes; formed embryoid bodies; expressed markers of the three germ layers after differentiation; and formed teratomas after injection into non-obese diabetic-severe combined immune deficient (NOD-SCID) mice. Thus, melatonin helped coax ES-like cells from rabbit blastocysts, which raises intriguing questions on the relationship between pluripotency and proliferation in rabbit embryonic stem cells.
