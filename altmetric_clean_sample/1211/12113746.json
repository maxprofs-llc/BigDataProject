The diagnosis of capA\u03b2 was determined using immunohistochemistry against A\u03b2, and of CAA using Congo red confirmed by A\u03b2 immunohistochemistry, both analyzed in six brain areas. The severity of capA\u03b2 was graded semi-quantitatively, and the severity of CAA was based on the percentage of affected vessels. Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type neuropathology (CERAD score and Braak stage) was analyzed using standard methods.\nCAA-Type1 was present in 86\/300, CAA-Type2 in 135\/300, and 79\/300 had no CAA. CapA\u03b2 was most frequent in the occipital lobe (79\/86). CAA-Type1 was associated with the severity of CAA (p\u200a< \u200a0.001), dementia (p\u200a< \u200a0.001), severe AD-type neuropathology (p-value 0.09 for CERAD C and 0.017 for Braak stages V-VI), and APOE \u025b4 allele carrier status (p\u200a< \u200a0.001).\nThis population-based study confirmed the presence of distinct CAA-Type1 and its association with the severity of CAA, severe AD-type neuropathology, and the APOE \u025b4 carrier status. Both the severity and localization of the deposition seemed to determine the clinical significance of capA\u03b2.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c7a","authors":["M\u00e4kel\u00e4, Mira","Paetau, Anders","Polvikoski, Tuomo","Myllykangas, Liisa","Tanskanen, Maarit"],"doi":"10.3233\/jad-150241","endpage":"157","first_seen_on":"2016-09-21T06:07:51+00:00","issns":["1875-8908","13872877","18758908"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Alzheimer's Disease","last_mentioned_on":1474438059,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26444758?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26444758","pubdate":"2015-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"149","subjects":["geriatrics","neurology"],"title":"Capillary Amyloid-\u03b2 Protein Deposition in a Population-Based Study (Vantaa 85+)","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/capillary-amyloid%CE%B2-protein-deposition-populationbased-study-vantaa-85"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":4493807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2342626,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253738,"mean":12.663788024608,"rank":140109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":89315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253738,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2493,"mean":15.665381219904,"rank":1992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2493,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176,"mean":17.625611428571,"rank":171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
