But their direct relationship remains unclear.\nWe aimed to examine the relationship between CMD-UT and newly diagnosed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Chinese adults.\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted on 7516 adults in Tianjin, China. The CMD-UT was collected via a questionnaire included five categories. NAFLD [with normal or elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) levels] was diagnosed by at least twice liver ultrasonography examinations and serum ALT concentrations (>41\u2009U\/L in males and\u2009>33\u2009U\/L in females).\nThe prevalence of overall NAFLD, NAFLD with normal or elevated ALT levels was 18.2, 14.2, and 4.0%, respectively. After adjustments for potential confounding factors, the odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of having overall NAFLD by increasing CMD-UT levels were 1.00 for\u2009<1\u2009h\/d, 1.58 (1.22-2.05) for 1-3\u2009h\/d, 1.58 (1.18-2.11) for 3-5\u2009h\/d, 1.65 (1.21-2.27) for 5-10\u2009h\/d, and 1.99 (1.29-3.05) for \u226510h\/d (P-trend for CMD-UT levels = 0.02), respectively. Similar relations were observed with the use of NAFLD with normal or elevated ALT levels.\nThe present study is the first to find that CMD-UT levels are independently associated with NAFLD. Key Messages The computer\/mobile devices usage time levels are independently associated with the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a27","authors":["Meng, Ge","Liu, Fangfang","Fang, Liyun","Li, Chunlei","Zhang, Qing","Liu, Li","Wu, Hongmei","Du, Huanmin","Shi, Hongbin","Xia, Yang","Guo, Xiaoyan","Liu, Xing","Bao, Xue","Su, Qian","Gu, Yeqing","Yu, Fei","Yang, Huijun","Yu, Bin","Sun, Shaomei","Wang, Xing","Zhou, Ming","Jia, Qiyu","Guo, Qi","Chen, Xin","Song, Kun","Wang, Guolin","Huang, Guowei","Niu, Kaijun","Ge Meng","Fangfang Liu","Liyun Fang","Chunlei Li","Qing Zhang","Li Liu","Hongmei Wu","Huanmin Du","Hongbin Shi","Yang Xia","Xiaoyan Guo","Xing Liu","Xue Bao","Qian Su","Yeqing Gu","Fei Yu","Huijun Yang","Bin Yu","Shaomei Sun","Xing Wang","Ming Zhou","Qiyu Jia","Qi Guo","Xin Chen","Kun Song","Guolin Wang","Guowei Huang","Kaijun Niu"],"doi":"10.1080\/07853890.2016.1219454","endpage":"9","first_seen_on":"2016-09-21T10:33:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1365-2060","0785-3890"],"journal":"Annals of Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1490730616,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27649339?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07853890.2016.1219454","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07853890.2016.1219454?hootPostID=0408bf09ff455cd55c72ef99067bfb9b","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07853890.2016.1219454?hootPostID=fa26fb2b1c8b2f3238f800e2124ca10a","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07853890.2016.1219454?hootPostID=47e6976a42cbb2255b63f845efbe2edf","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07853890.2016.1219454?hootPostID=d053c980ec1df2add9463ce1b454ef24","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07853890.2016.1219454?hootPostID=d45892b9564e6237b1c58ad561f9414a","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07853890.2016.1219454?hootPostID=3b6a13479601c2b10c06c44819fb695f","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07853890.2016.1219454?hootPostID=609460d7e418ea0229fa2d0b745c14f2","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07853890.2016.1219454?hootPostID=609460d7e418ea0229fa2d0b745c14f2&","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07853890.2016.1219454?hootPostID=d45892b9564e6237b1c58ad561f9414a&","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07853890.2016.1219454?hootPostID=dd4f7116935444a7a9901721f1ef9958"],"pmid":"27649339","pubdate":"2016-09-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The overall computer\/mobile devices usage time is related to newly diagnosed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a population-based study","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07853890.2016.1219454","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/overall-computermobile-devices-usage-time-related-newly-diagnosed-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":4253648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3954558,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253892,"mean":12.66008955024,"rank":129385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":115022,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253892,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":474,"mean":7.7169936575053,"rank":283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":179,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":474,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":14.696153846154,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
