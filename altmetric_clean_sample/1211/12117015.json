An important regulatory protein of HEV, ORF3, influences multiple signal pathways in host cells. In this study, to investigate the function of ORF3 from the swine form of HEV (SHEV), high-throughput RNA-Seq-based screening was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes in ORF3-expressing HepG2 cells. The results were validated with quantitative real-time PCR and gene ontology was employed to assign differentially expressed genes to functional categories. The results indicated that, in the established ORF3-expressing HepG2 cells, the mRNA levels of CLDN6, YLPM1, APOC3, NLRP1, SCARA3, FGA, FGG, FGB, and FREM1 were upregulated, whereas the mRNA levels of SLC2A3, DKK1, BPIFB2, and PTGR1 were downregulated. The deregulated expression of CLDN6 and FREM1 might contribute to changes in integral membrane protein and basement membrane protein expression, expression changes for NLRP1 might affect the apoptosis of HepG2 cells, and the altered expression of APOC3, SCARA3, and DKK1 may affect lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, ORF3 plays a functional role in virus-cell interactions by affecting the expression of integral membrane protein and basement membrane proteins and by altering the process of apoptosis and lipid metabolism in host cells. These findings provide important insight into the pathogenic mechanism of HEV.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Xu, Kailian","Guo, Shiyu","Zhao, Tianjing","Zhu, Huapei","Jiao, Hanwei","Shi, Qiaoyun","Pang, Feng","Li, Yaying","Li, Guohua","Peng, Dongmei","Nie, Xin","Cheng, Ying","Wu, Kebang","Du, Li","Cui, Ke","Zhang, Wenguang","Wang, Fengyang"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/1648030","endpage":"8","first_seen_on":"2016-09-21T10:08:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2314-6141","2314-6133"],"journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1474462820,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27648443?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27648443?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27648443"],"pmid":"27648443","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","title":"Transcriptome Analysis of HepG2 Cells Expressing ORF3 from Swine Hepatitis E Virus to Determine the Effects of ORF3 on Host Cells","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transcriptome-analysis-hepg2-cells-expressing-orf3-swine-hepatitis-e-virus-determine-effects-orf3-ho"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":4493806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2342627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253738,"mean":12.663791177479,"rank":140109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":89315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253738,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4403,"mean":2.9221662880509,"rank":1618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4403,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":9.9073442622951,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RNA_seq\/statuses\/778536304527028224","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12117015],"posted_on":"2016-09-21T10:08:14+00:00","author":{"name":"RNA_seq","url":"http:\/\/genomics.cruk.cam.ac.uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/520297032267747328\/-Xsy4uCB_normal.png","description":"A PubMed RSS feed for RNA-seq [title\/abstract], by dlvr.it,  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1qv7gmS, and @CIgenomics","id_on_source":"RNA_seq","tweeter_id":"2820227945","geo":{"lt":52.2,"ln":0.11667,"country":"GB"},"followers":1857},"tweet_id":"778536304527028224"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SeqComplete\/statuses\/778537138916827136","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12117015],"posted_on":"2016-09-21T10:11:33+00:00","author":{"name":"SeqComplete","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/432012289185546240\/nESezhJN_normal.jpeg","description":"Latest Buzzz in Cutting-Edge #NGS #Genomics #PersonalizedMedicine #PrecisionMedicine #LiquidBiopsy  #BioIT  #RNASeq #CRISPR #Geneediting #Bigdata","id_on_source":"SeqComplete","tweeter_id":"335246117","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3092},"tweet_id":"778537138916827136"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ScienceyBot\/statuses\/778564416178573312","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12117015],"posted_on":"2016-09-21T11:59:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Sciencey Things","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/703346006117720064\/30HyYboT_normal.jpg","description":"Bot that uploads PubMed papers on themes: #parallelevolution, #transcriptomics, #Drosophila, #evodevo,  #sexualselection, and cryptic female choice","id_on_source":"ScienceyBot","tweeter_id":"703255639901003776","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":30},"tweet_id":"778564416178573312"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/transcriptomes\/statuses\/778579616667619331","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12117015],"posted_on":"2016-09-21T13:00:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Transcriptomes","url":"http:\/\/davetang.org\/muse\/2015\/01\/31\/transcriptome-feed-using-r\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/561190761790574593\/2j6U4lnz_normal.png","description":"A transcriptome feed made using #Rstats.
