Administrative burdens impose limits on completion of these measures. The PROMIS group developed an outcome measure to improve reporting of patient symptoms and function and to reduce administrative burden. Despite early success, NDI and mJOA have not been compared with PROMIS in patients with cervical myelopathy. This study determines the correlation of NDI and mJOA with PROMIS in surgical patients with cervical myelopathy.\n60 patients with cervical myelopathy undergoing surgery were included. PROMIS, NDI, and mJOA were collected preoperatively, and in the first 6 months postoperatively. Correlations between NDI, mJOA and PROMIS were quantified using Pearson correlation coefficients. Students T-tests were used to test significance.\nAll 60 (100%) of patients completed preoperative questionnaires. 55 (92%) of patients completed initial follow up questionnaires within the first 6 months. PROMIS physical function and NDI demonstrated a strong negative correlation at baseline and in initial follow up (R\u200a=\u200a-0.69, -0.76). PROMIS and mJOA demonstrated a strong positive correlation at baseline and in initial follow up (R\u200a=\u200a0.61, 0.72).\nPROMIS physical function has a strong negative correlation with NDI and a strong positive correlation with mJOA at baseline and in the early postoperative course in patients undergoing surgery for cervical myelopathy. Surgeons may factor these outcomes into the delivery and interpretation of patient reported outcome measures in this population. Use of PROMIS may improve completion of outcome measures in the office and reduce administrative burden while still providing reliable outcomes data.\n3.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a7","authors":["Owen, Robert J.","Zebala, Luke","Peters, Colleen","McAnany, Steven"],"doi":"10.1097\/brs.0000000000002373","first_seen_on":"2017-08-17T01:05:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0362-2436"],"journal":"Spine","last_mentioned_on":1502886873,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/9000\/00000\/PROMIS_Physical_Function_Correlation_with_NDI_and.95408.pdf?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/9000\/00000\/PROMIS_Physical_Function_Correlation_with_NDI_and.95408.pdf","pmid":"28787313","pubdate":"2017-08-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"PROMIS Physical Function Correlation with NDI and mJOA in the Surgical Cervical Myelopathy Patient Population","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/PROMIS_Physical_Function_Correlation_with_NDI_and.95408.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":7249275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166201,"mean":12.74329345367,"rank":136485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166201,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5035,"mean":5.8719531187922,"rank":3848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5035,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":2.1041379310345,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"PROMIS Physical Function Correlation with NDI and mJOA in the Surgical Cervical Myelopathy Patient Population.","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1446382398786567&id=110235899067897","license":"public","citation_ids":[23934413],"posted_on":"2017-08-16T12:34:33+00:00","summary":": Abstract Study Design. retrospective review Objective.
