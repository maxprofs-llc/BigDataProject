The purpose of this study was to identify differences in how younger, middle-aged, and older adults were able to use immediate repetition to improve speech recognition in the presence of different kinds of maskers. Results suggest that all groups received approximately the same amount of benefit from repetition. Repetition benefit was largest when the masker was fluctuating noise and smallest when it was competing speech.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040f2","authors":["Karen S. Helfer","Karen S.
