Multiple techniques have been described in the literature to address perforations using numerous techniques; however, there have been varying rates of success and reproducibility reported. The use of a large, pericranial flap was previously described to repair large septal perforation. The objective of this case report is to describe the use of a pedicled pericranial flap in combination with intraoperative fluorescence angiography to quantify vascular perfusion. This article presents a 31-year-old man with an idiopathic, septal perforation measuring 1.7\u2009\u00d7\u20091.7 cm who previously failed medical therapy and surgical repair. He underwent a combined, coronal incision and external rhinoplasty approach with a tunneled pericranial flap resulting in a successful repair. This case report illustrates robust reconstructive capability of pericranial flaps for repair of septal perforations, as well as the potential value of intraoperative fluorescence angiography in determining the likelihood of a successful outcome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6133cf058f61000700a","authors":["Ryan Williams","Matthew K.
