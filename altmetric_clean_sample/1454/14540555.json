Based on reports of its specific expression in the DP, we investigated STAT5 activation during hair development and cycling. STAT5 activation in the DP began in late catagen, reaching a peak in early anagen before disappearing for the rest of the cycle. This was confirmed by the expression profile of SOCS2, a STAT5 target in the DP. This pattern of expression starts after the first postnatal hair cycle. Quantification of hair cycling using the Flash canonical Wnt signalling in vivo bioluminescence reporter found that conditional knockout of STAT5A\/B in the DP targeted through Cre recombinase under the control of the Sox18 promoter, resulted in delayed anagen entry compared to control. Microarray analysis of STAT5-deletion versus control revealed key changes in TNF-alpha, Wnt and FGF ligands, known for their role in inducing anagen entry. We conclude that STAT5 activation acts as a mesenchymal switch to trigger natural anagen entry in post-developmental hair follicle cycling.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e0e","authors":["Julien M.D. Legrand","Edwige Roy","Jonathan J.
