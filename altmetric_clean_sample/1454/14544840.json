We introduce a new model which uses stacked autoencoders to learn higher-level representations from textual and visual input. The visual modality is encoded via vectors of attributes obtained automatically from images. We create a new large-scale taxonomy of 600 visual attributes representing more than 500 concepts and 700K images. We use this dataset to train attribute classifiers and integrate their predictions with text-based distributional models of word meaning. We evaluate our model on its ability to simulate word similarity judgments and concept categorization. On both tasks, our model yields a better fit to behavioral data compared to baselines and related models which either rely on a single modality or do not make use of attribute-based input.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a67","authors":["Carina Silberer","Vittorio Ferrari","Mirella Lapata","Silberer, Carina","Ferrari, Vittorio","Lapata, Mirella","C.
