Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) or Endoscopic ultrasonograhy-guided biliary access (EUS-BD) are alternative treatments but are associated with a higher morbidity and mortality rate. The aim of the study is to report overall technical success rate and clinical outcome with deployment of temporary fully or partially covered self-expanding duodenal stent (pc\/fcSEMS) as a bridge to ERCP in case of inaccessible papilla due to duodenal strictures.\nThis retrospective study included 66 consecutive patients presenting with a duodenal stricture impeding the ability to perform an ERCP. Provisional duodenal stenting was performed as a bridge to ERCP. A second endoscopic session was performed to remove the provisional stent and to perform an ERCP. Afterward, a permanent duodenal stent was delivered if necessary.\nSixty-six duodenal stents (17 pcSEMS and 49 fcSEMS) were delivered with a median indwelling time of 3.15 (1\u200a-\u200a7) days. Two migrations occurred in the pcSEMS group, 1 of which required lower endoscopy for retrieval. No other procedure-related complications were observed. At second endoscopy a successful ERCP was performed in 56 patients (85\u200a%); 10 patients (15\u200a%) with endoscopic failure underwent PTBD or EUS-BD. Forty patients needed permanent duodenal stenting.\nProvisional removable covered duodenal stenting as a bridge to ERCP for duodenal obstruction is safe procedure and in most cases allows successful performance of therapeutic ERCP. This technique could be a sound option as a step up approach before referring such cases for more complex techniques such as EUS-BD or PTBD.","authors":["Gianfranco Donatelli","Fabrizio Cereatti","Jean-Loup Dumont","Parag Dhumane","Thierry Tuszynski","Serge Derhy","Alexandre Meduri","Bertrand Marie Vergeau","Bruno Meduri"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0042-107070","endpage":"E963","first_seen_on":"2016-12-07T19:48:36+00:00","issns":["2364-3722","2196-9736"],"issue":"9","journal":"Endoscopy International Open","last_mentioned_on":1463049423,"links":["https:\/\/www.thieme-connect.com\/products\/ejournals\/pdf\/10.1055\/s-0042-107070.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.thieme-connect.com\/products\/ejournals\/pdf\/10.1055\/s-0042-107070.pdf","pmid":"27652301","pubdate":"2016-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"\u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG","startpage":"E957","title":"Temporary duodenal stenting as a bridge to ERCP for inaccessible papilla due to duodenal obstruction: a retrospective study","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/temporary-duodenal-stenting-bridge-ercp-inaccessible-papilla-due-duodenal-obstruction-retrospective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
