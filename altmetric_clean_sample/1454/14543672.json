The challenges and costs of obtaining the necessary data often result in absent or poor abundance information. We applied capture-recapture models to estimate abundance, survival and temporary emigration of odontocete populations within a 2,400 km2 semi-enclosed Mediterranean bay, the Gulf of Corinth. Boat surveys were conducted in 2011-2015 to collect photo-identification data on striped dolphins Stenella coeruleoalba, short-beaked common dolphins Delphinus delphis (always found together with striped dolphins in mixed groups) and common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus, totaling 1,873 h of tracking. After grading images for quality and marking distinctiveness, 23,995 high-quality photos were included in a striped and common dolphin catalog, and 2,472 in a bottlenose dolphin catalog. The proportions of striped and common dolphins were calculated from the photographic sample and used to scale capture-recapture estimates. Best-fitting robust design capture-recapture models denoted no temporary emigration between years for striped and common dolphins, and random temporary emigration for bottlenose dolphins, suggesting different residency patterns in agreement with previous studies. Average estimated abundance over the five years was 1,331 (95% CI 1,122-1,578) striped dolphins, 22 (16-32) common dolphins, 55 (36-84) \"intermediate\" animals (potential striped x common dolphin hybrids) and 38 (32-46) bottlenose dolphins. Apparent survival was constant for striped, common and intermediate dolphins (0.94, 95% CI 0.92-0.96) and year-dependent for bottlenose dolphins (an average of 0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.95). Our work underlines the importance of long-term monitoring to contribute reliable baseline information that can help assess the conservation status of wildlife populations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Nina Luisa Santostasi","Silvia Bonizzoni","Giovanni Bearzi","Lavinia Eddy","Olivier Gimenez"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0166650","first_seen_on":"2016-12-07T20:25:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1482336962,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0166650","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0166650"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0166650&type=printable","pmcid":"PMC5142793","pmid":"27926926","pubdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0166650","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"A Robust Design Capture-Recapture Analysis of Abundance, Survival and Temporary Emigration of Three Odontocete Species in the Gulf of Corinth, Greece","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/robust-design-capturerecapture-analysis-abundance-survival-temporary-emigration-three-odontocete-spe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7917108,"mean":6.6979661075636,"rank":3684661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4055260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7917108,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254627,"mean":12.254179934492,"rank":120294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":127628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254627,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111277,"mean":10.337223516302,"rank":53348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":53460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111277,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3854,"mean":11.98197508435,"rank":1837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":1885,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3854,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
