The balance between differentiation and self-renewal is critical to maintain muscle tissue homeostasis, and alterations in this equilibrium can lead to chronic muscle degeneration. The transcription factor CCAAT\/enhancer binding protein beta (C\/EBP\u03b2) is expressed in Pax7(+) satellite cells of healthy muscle and is downregulated during myoblast differentiation. Persistent expression of C\/EBP\u03b2 upregulates Pax7, inhibits MyoD, and blocks myogenic differentiation.\nUsing genetic tools to conditionally abrogate C\/EBP\u03b2 expression in Pax7(+) cells, we examined the role of C\/EBP\u03b2 in self-renewal of satellite cells during muscle regeneration.\nWe find that loss of C\/EBP\u03b2 leads to precocious differentiation at the expense of self-renewal in primary myoblast and myofiber cultures. After a single muscle injury, C\/EBP\u03b2-deficient satellite cells fail to self-renew resulting in a reduction of satellite cells available for future rounds of regeneration. After a second round of injury, muscle regeneration is impaired in C\/EBP\u03b2 conditional knockout mice compared to wild-type control mice. We find that C\/EBP\u03b2 can regulate Notch2 expression and that restoration of Notch activity in myoblasts lacking C\/EBP\u03b2 prevents precocious differentiation.\nThese findings demonstrate that C\/EBP\u03b2 is a novel regulator of satellite cell self-renewal during muscle regeneration acting at least in part through Notch2.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000899","authors":["Neena Lala-Tabbert","Hamood AlSudais","Fran\u00e7ois Marchildon","Dechen Fu","Nadine Wiper-Bergeron"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13395-016-0112-8","first_seen_on":"2016-12-07T16:12:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2044-5040"],"issue":"1","journal":"Skeletal Muscle","last_mentioned_on":1481226975,"links":["http:\/\/skeletalmusclejournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13395-016-0112-8","https:\/\/skeletalmusclejournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13395-016-0112-8"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/skeletalmusclejournal.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13395-016-0112-8?site=skeletalmusclejournal.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC5142279","pmid":"27923399","pubdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","startpage":"40","title":"CCAAT\/enhancer binding protein \u03b2 is required for satellite cell self-renewal","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ccaatenhancer-binding-protein-%CE%B2-required-satellite-cell-selfrenewal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.05,"score_history":{"1y":5.05,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7861897,"mean":6.6582651640212,"rank":1465126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6391066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7861897,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251291,"mean":12.282115778582,"rank":66915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":183953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251291,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176,"mean":5.8039085714286,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":8.1166,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
