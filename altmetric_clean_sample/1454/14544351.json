With the growing evidence that sex influences all levels of brain functions, this Mini-Review highlights studies in which sex was a controlled variable and that provided evidence of sexual dimorphism in behavioral outcome, extension of brain damage, mechanisms of lesion, and treatment efficacy in the rat neonatal HI model. It was shown that 1) females have greater memory deficits; 2) cell death is dependent mainly on caspase activation in females; 3) males are more susceptible to oxidative stress; and 4) treatments acting on distinct cell death pathways afford sex-dependent neuroprotection. These tentative conclusions, along with growing evidence from other fields of neurobiology, support the need for scientists to design their experiments considering sex as an important variable; otherwise, important knowledge will continue to be missed. It is conceivable that sex can influence the development of efficacious therapeutic tools to treat neonates suffering from brain HI. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d97","authors":["Netto, Carlos Alexandre","Sanches, Eduardo","Odorcyk, Felipe Kawa","Duran\u2010Carabali, Luz Elena","Weis, Simone Nardin"],"doi":"10.1002\/jnr.23828","endpage":"421","first_seen_on":"2016-12-07T21:20:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1097-4547"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience Research","last_mentioned_on":1481165028,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jnr.23828\/full?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jnr.23828\/pdf","pmid":"27870406","pubdate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"409","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Sex-dependent consequences of neonatal brain hypoxia-ischemia in the rat","type":"article","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sexdependent-consequences-neonatal-brain-hypoxiaischemia-rat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7861897,"mean":6.6582651640212,"rank":5682250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1899650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7861897,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251291,"mean":12.282290278164,"rank":162802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":76272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251291,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1106,"mean":5.3302968325792,"rank":818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1106,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134,"mean":12.68215037594,"rank":115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
