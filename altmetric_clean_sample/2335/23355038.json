However, these fractures are extremely rare in children. We present a pediatric low-energy Hawkins type III fracture-dislocation that had excessive displacement accompanied by neurovascular and tendon entrapment. A 9-year-old male patient referred to our hospital 5\u00a0hours after jumping off a swing in a children's playground. An excessively displaced talar neck fracture-dislocation was observed at the initial evaluation. The patient underwent urgent surgery. The tibialis posterior flexor digitorum longus tendons, posterior tibial artery, and tibial nerve were entrapped at the fracture site. The\u00a0talar neck fracture was reduced using open reduction. The neurovascular structures and tendons were removed from the fracture site. The fracture was fixed using two 4.5-mm cannulated screws. The patient was able to bear full weight at 10\u00a0weeks postoperatively. At 6 months, the patient was able to walk unassisted with full ankle range of motion. However, at 2 years, his American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot scale score had decreased to 72 points, and we observed avascular necrosis in the talar head. In conclusion, talar fractures are rare but can lead to serious complications. In the pediatric population, even low-energy trauma, such as had occurred in our patient, can result in severe displaced fracture-dislocations. After severe displaced fracture-dislocations, important soft tissue structures can become entrapped between fracture fragments, and surgeons should be aware of this situation when considering using closed reduction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a39","authors":["K\u0131z\u0131lay, Yusuf Onur","Aytan, Onur"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.jfas.2017.05.007","first_seen_on":"2017-08-02T00:31:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1067-2516","10672516","1542-2224"],"journal":"Journal of Foot & Ankle Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1501633875,"links":["http:\/\/www.jfas.org\/article\/S1067-2516(17)30293-4\/fulltext?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=gerresdpm"],"pmid":"28778631","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics","generalsurgery"],"title":"Low-Energy Hawkins Type III Talar Neck Fracture-Dislocation With Neurovascular and Tendon Entrapment in a Pediatric Patient","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lowenergy-hawkins-type-iii-talar-neck-fracturedislocation-neurovascular-tendon-entrapment-pediatric"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":6308497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1125477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174895,"mean":11.744266641509,"rank":123442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174895,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":528,"mean":2.5905123339658,"rank":275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":528,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":0.97435897435897,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
