Symptomatic plants from both species were shown to be infected with milk vetch dwarf virus (MDV) by PCR. The complete genomes of MDV isolates from cowpea and broad bean were sequenced. Each of them had eight genomic DNAs that differed between the two isolates by 10.7% in their overall nucleotide sequences. In addition, the MDV genomes from cowpea and broad bean were associated with two and three alphasatellite DNAs, respectively. This is the first report of MDV on cowpea in China and the first complete genome sequences of Chinese MDV isolates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000230f","authors":["Chenhua Zhang","Hongying Zheng","Dankan Yan","Kelei Han","Xijiao Song","Yong Liu","Dongfang Zhang","Jianping Chen","Fei Yan"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00705-017-3348-7","first_seen_on":"2017-08-01T20:19:47+00:00","issns":["0304-8608","1432-8798"],"journal":"Archives of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1501618773,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28386650?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28386650","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Virology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Complete genomic characterization of milk vetch dwarf virus isolates from cowpea and broad bean in Anhui province, China","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-genomic-characterization-milk-vetch-dwarf-virus-isolates-cowpea-broad-bean-anhui-province-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307946,"mean":7.0029014072595,"rank":7183520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307946,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172481,"mean":11.678480160019,"rank":141019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172481,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1509,"mean":2.0431564986737,"rank":1102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1509,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":0.86762857142857,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/virus_genome\/statuses\/892479938237837312","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23351740],"posted_on":"2017-08-01T20:19:33+00:00","author":{"name":"virus_genome","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/521180909693706240\/M3tk_fXm_normal.png","id_on_source":"virus_genome","tweeter_id":"544722510","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":50},"tweet_id":"892479938237837312"}]}}
