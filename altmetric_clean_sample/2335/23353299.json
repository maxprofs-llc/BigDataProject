The effects of drought on sorghum during seedling establishment have not been determined. Coating seeds with a water absorbing substance offers a way to buffer the seed against insufficient moisture in the surrounding soil. Seeds of two different sorghum varieties were coated with one of two commercially available hydro-absorbers: Stokosorb(\u00ae) and Geohumus(\u00ae). These hydro-absorbers have the capacity to store water several times their own weight. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of the cited hydro-absorbers on early seedling growth of two sorghum landraces under different levels of soil water deficit. Seedlings were grown for 12 days under three water availability levels (Field capacity (FC), 50% of FC, and 25% of FC). The seedlings under water limited treatments were subsequently re-watered. Biomass, root length, plant height, leaf area, and leaf extension rate were monitored in two-day intervals for 24 days. Coating strongly affected seedling growth both under fully watered and water deficit conditions. Sorghum varieties differed in their responses to both soil water deficit and coating materials. In general, Stockosorb improved seedling performance under water limited conditions particularly by promoting root growth, whereas Geohumus did not.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef652a83ee09648b4f4c","authors":["Linda Gorim","Folkard Asch","Gorim, Linda","Asch, Folkard"],"doi":"10.3390\/biology6030033","first_seen_on":"2017-08-01T22:00:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2079-7737"],"issue":"3","journal":"Biology","last_mentioned_on":1504687202,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2079-7737\/6\/3\/33","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/biology6030033","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28758977","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2079-7737\/6\/3\/33\/htm"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2079-7737\/6\/3\/33\/pdf","pmid":"28758977","pubdate":"2017-07-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Seed Coating with Hydro-Absorbers as Potential Mitigation of Early Season Drought in Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.
