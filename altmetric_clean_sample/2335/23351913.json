Here we first time report the molecular mechanism of a marine sponge alkaloid derivative 4-chloro fascapysin (4-CF) for its anticancer and antiangiogenesis potential. It simultaneously targets multiple cancer and angiogenesis dynamics, such as proliferation, chemotaxis cell migration, and invasion, growth factors signaling cascade, autophagy and apoptosis in HUVEC and MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells. It inhibited the VEGF mediated microvessel sprouting and blood vessel formation in the matrigel plug of C57\/BL6J mice. It inhibits the tumor growth in ET (solid) mouse tumor model. It significantly inhibited cell survival through PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR pathway, with attendant effects on key pro-angiogenesis factors like HIF-1\u03b1, eNOS and MMP-2\/9. The cytotoxicity of 4-CF was reversed by co-treatment with the VEGF and Akt inhibitors sunitinib and perifosine, respectively or by the addition of neutralizing VEGF antibodies. The apoptotic potential of 4-CF was through mitochondrial dependent as illustrated through loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. The safety profile of 4-CF was acceptable as it exhibits five times high cytotoxic IC50 value in normal cells as well as no apparent toxicities in experimental tumor mice at therapeutic doses.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ef","authors":["Sharma, Sonia","Guru, Santosh Kumar","Manda, Sudhakar","Kumar, Ashok","Mintoo, Mubashir J.","Prasad, Venna Deva","Sharma, Parduman R.","Mondhe, Dilip M.","Bharate, Sandip B.","Bhushan, Shashi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cbi.2017.07.017","first_seen_on":"2017-08-01T20:27:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0009-2797","1872-7786"],"journal":"Chemico-Biological Interactions","last_mentioned_on":1506593525,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28756150?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28756150","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"A marine sponge alkaloid derivative 4-chloro fascaplysin inhibits tumor growth and VEGF mediated angiogenesis by disrupting PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR signaling cascade","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/marine-sponge-alkaloid-derivative-4chloro-fascaplysin-inhibits-tumor-growth-vegf-mediated-angiogenes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":1,"1w":1,"6d":1,"5d":1,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":4275344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3968368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228286,"mean":12.776227382438,"rank":115521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":102705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228286,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":965,"mean":2.9393215767635,"rank":591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":965,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":0.85,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AutophagyPapers\/statuses\/892481875351961600","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23351913],"posted_on":"2017-08-01T20:27:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Autophagy Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/559405603697590273\/EoGNUIXe_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for #Autophagy papers.
