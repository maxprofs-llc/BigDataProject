DeCon was recently developed to detect such changes in mean and\\or correlation by combining a moving windows approach and robust PCA. However, in the literature, several other methods have been proposed that employ other non-parametric tools: E-divisive, Multirank, and KCP. Since these methods use different statistical approaches, two issues need to be tackled. First, applied researchers may find it hard to appraise the differences between the methods. Second, a direct comparison of the relative performance of all these methods for capturing change points signaling correlation changes is still lacking. Therefore, we present the basic principles behind DeCon, E-divisive, Multirank, and KCP and the corresponding algorithms, to make them more accessible to readers. We further compared their performance through extensive simulations using the settings of Bulteel et al. (Biological Psychology, 98 (1), 29-42, 2014) implying changes in mean and in correlation structure and those of Matteson and James (Journal of the American Statistical Association, 109 (505), 334-345, 2014) implying different numbers of (noise) variables. KCP emerged as the best method in almost all settings. However, in case of more than two noise variables, only DeCon performed adequately in detecting correlation changes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000239d","authors":["Jedelyn Cabrieto","Francis Tuerlinckx","Peter Kuppens","Mariel Grassmann","Eva Ceulemans"],"doi":"10.3758\/s13428-016-0754-9","first_seen_on":"2016-07-11T21:57:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1554-3528"],"journal":"Behavior Research Methods","last_mentioned_on":1494930775,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.3758%2Fs13428-016-0754-9"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.3758%2Fs13428-016-0754-9.pdf","pmid":"27383753","pubdate":"2016-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"Detecting correlation changes in multivariate time series: A comparison of four non-parametric change point detection methods","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detecting-correlation-changes-multivariate-time-series-comparison-four-nonparametric-change-point-de-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8213437,"mean":6.9553152651275,"rank":6236886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1105790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8213437,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259956,"mean":11.729465907561,"rank":181934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259956,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":743,"mean":5.0362398921833,"rank":572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":743,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":3.5306818181818,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":2,"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BehavEcolPapers\/statuses\/752622777622929408","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9613534],"posted_on":"2016-07-11T21:57:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Behav Ecol Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/517345050670268416\/beckzx8T_normal.jpeg","description":"Papers in behavioral ecology #ethology animal #behavior from #PubMed & journal feeds @ASNAmNAT @PLOSBiology @LinneanSociety - literature bot by @MihalyFoldvari","id_on_source":"BehavEcolPapers","tweeter_id":"2797948887","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1177},"tweet_id":"752622777622929408"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BehavEcolPapers\/statuses\/864409364139982848","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9613534],"posted_on":"2017-05-16T09:17:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Behav Ecol Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/517345050670268416\/beckzx8T_normal.jpeg","description":"Papers in behavioral ecology #ethology animal #behavior from #PubMed & journal feeds @ASNAmNAT @PLOSBiology @LinneanSociety - literature bot by @MihalyFoldvari","id_on_source":"BehavEcolPapers","tweeter_id":"2797948887","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1177},"tweet_id":"864409364139982848"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/reiver\/statuses\/864428443210924032","license":"gnip","rt":["BehavEcolPapers"],"citation_ids":[9613534],"posted_on":"2017-05-16T10:32:55+00:00","author":{"name":"@reiver (Charles)","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/LhMjpC4Bwo","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1542967349\/reiver-star_normal.png","description":"Software Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning, AI, ALife, Evolutionary Biology & Psychology,  Psychometrics, Genetics, Neuroscience, Behavioral Ecology,\u2026","id_on_source":"reiver","tweeter_id":"14156466","followers":2827},"tweet_id":"864428443210924032"}]}}
