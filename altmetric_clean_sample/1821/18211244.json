Fe in the two kinds of rolls was labeled with two radioisotopes of Fe (55Fe, 59Fe) and the rolls were served on alternate days. The inhibition of Fe absorption was strongly related to the amount of phytate added; 2 mg inhibited absorption by 18%, (p less than 0.001), 25 mg by 64% (p less than 0.001), and 250 mg by 82% (p less than 0.001). The addition of ascorbic acid significantly counteracted the inhibition whereas the corresponding effect of meat was less well defined and only seen at the highest phytate level. The marked inhibition of Fe absorption by phytates and the significant counteracting effect of ascorbic acid have wide nutritional implications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005700","authors":["Hallberg, L","Brune, M","Rossander, L"],"first_seen_on":"2017-03-29T08:10:58+00:00","issns":["0002-9165"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1490370720,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2911999"],"pmid":"2911999","pubdate":"1989-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Iron absorption in man: ascorbic acid and dose-dependent inhibition by phytate.","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/iron-absorption-man-ascorbic-acid-dosedependent-inhibition-phytate"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":7267968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248470,"mean":13.235818085958,"rank":205466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248470,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6035,"mean":27.275748425588,"rank":5671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6035,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":35.075163636364,"rank":103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
