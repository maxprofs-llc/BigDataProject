However, the PREX1 domains that facilitate its oncogenic activity and downstream signaling are not completely understood. We identify ERK1\/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) acts downstream of PREX1 and contributes to PREX1-mediated anchorage independent cell growth. PREX1 overexpression increased but its shRNA knockdown decreased ERK1\/2 phosphorylation in response to EGF\/IGF-1 stimulation resulting in induction of the cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and p21(WAF1\/CIP1) PREX1-mediated ERK1\/2 phosphorylation, anchorage-independent cell growth and cell migration were suppressed by inhibition of MEK1\/2\/ERK1\/2 signaling. PREX1 overexpression reduced staurosporine-induced apoptosis whereas its shRNA knockdown promoted apoptosis in response to staurosporine or the anti-estrogen tamoxifen. Expression of wild-type but not GEF-inactive PREX1 increased anchorage independent cell growth. In addition mouse xenograft studies revealed expression of wild-type but not GEF-dead PREX1 resulted in the formation of larger tumors that displayed increased phosphorylation of ERK1\/2, but not AKT. The impaired anchorage-independent cell growth, apoptosis and ERK1\/2 signaling observed in stable PREX1 knockdown cells was restored by expression of wild-type, but not GEF-dead-PREX1. Therefore PREX1-Rac-GEF activity is critical for PREX1 dependent anchorage independent cell growth and xenograft tumor growth and may represent a possible therapeutic target for breast cancers that exhibit PREX1 overexpression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Heng-Jia Liu","Lisa M.
