Since its introduction into China in 1984, both cultivation area and yield of this species have been dramatically increased such that China is now the leading producer of channel catfish. To aid genomic research in this species, data sets such as genetic linkage groups, long-insert libraries, physical maps, bacterial artificial clones (BAC) end sequences (BES), transcriptome assemblies, and reference genome sequences have been generated. Here, using diverse assembly methods, we provide a comparable high-quality genome assembly for a channel catfish from a breeding stock inbred in China for more than three generations, which was originally imported to China from North America.\nApproximately 201.6 gigabases (Gb) of genome reads were sequenced by the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Subsequently, we generated high quality, cost-effective and easily assembled sequences of the channel catfish genome with a scaffold N50 of 7.2\u00a0Mb and 95.6\u00a0% completeness. We also predicted that the channel catfish genome contains 21,556 protein-coding genes and 275.3\u00a0Mb (megabase pairs) of repetitive sequences.\nWe report a high-quality genome assembly of the channel catfish, which is comparable to a recent report of the \"Coco\" channel catfish. These generated genome data could be used as an initial platform for molecular breeding to obtain novel catfish varieties using genomic approaches.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81c3cf058f61000bb95","authors":["Xiaohui Chen","Liqiang Zhong","Chao Bian","Pao Xu","Ying Qiu","Xinxin You","Shiyong Zhang","Yu Huang","Jia Li","Minghua Wang","Qin Qin","Xiaohua Zhu","Chao Peng","Alex Wong","Zhifei Zhu","Min Wang","Ruobo Gu","Junmin Xu","Qiong Shi","Wenji Bian","Chen, Xiaohui","Zhong, Liqiang","Bian, Chao","Xu, Pao","Qiu, Ying","You, Xinxin","Zhang, Shiyong","Huang, Yu","Li, Jia","Wang, Minghua","Qin, Qin","Zhu, Xiaohua","Peng, Chao","Wong, Alex","Zhu, Zhifei","Wang, Min","Gu, Ruobo","Xu, Junmin","Shi, Qiong","Bian, Wenji"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13742-016-0142-5","first_seen_on":"2016-08-23T18:51:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2047-217X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Giga Science","last_mentioned_on":1473678180,"links":["http:\/\/gigascience.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13742-016-0142-5","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/s13742-016-0142-5","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27549802?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27549802","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27549802?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s13742-016-0142-5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/gigascience.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13742-016-0142-5?site=gigascience.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"27549802","pubdate":"2016-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computational Biology\/Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computer Appl. in Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"}],"startpage":"39","title":"High-quality genome assembly of channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highquality-genome-assembly-channel-catfish-ictalurus-punctatus-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.862,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.862},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":796978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7569104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254445,"mean":12.384334045998,"rank":36306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":218139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254445,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286,"mean":23.860547368421,"rank":169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":33.7855,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
