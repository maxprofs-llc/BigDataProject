Using single-Trp containing ApoC-III mutants, we have studied local sidechain environments and interactions in nanodiscs at positions W42, W54, and W65. Using transmission electron microscopy and circular dichroism spectroscopy, nanodiscs were characterized at the ultrastructural and secondary conformational levels, respectively. Nearly identical particles (15 \u00b1 2 nm) were produced from all proteins containing approximately 25 \u00b1 4 proteins per particle with an average helicity of 45-51% per protein. Distinct residue-specific fluorescence properties were observed with W54 residing in the most hydrophobic environment followed by W42 and W65. Interestingly, time-resolved anisotropy measurements revealed that Trp sidechain mobility is uncorrelated to the polarity of its surroundings. W54 is the most mobile compared to W65 and W42, which are more immobile in a nanodisc-bound state. Based on Trp spectral comparisons of ApoC-III in micellar and vesicle environments, ApoC-III binding within nanodiscs more closely resembles a bilayer-bound state. Despite being structurally similar, we found marked differences during nanodisc formation by the Trp variants as a function of temperature with W42 behaving the most similar to the WT protein. Our data suggest that despite the modest mutations of Trp to Phe at two of the three native sites, the interfacial location of W42 is important for lipid binding and nanodisc assembly, which may be biologically meaningful as of the three Trp residues, only W42 is invariant among mammals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["Chase A.
