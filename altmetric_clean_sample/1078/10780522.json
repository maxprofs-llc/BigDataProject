To extend the understanding on the genetic basis of kernel size traits (i.e., kernel length, kernel width and kernel thickness), we developed a set of four-way cross mapping population derived from four maize inbred lines with varied kernel sizes. In the present study, we investigated the genetic basis of natural variation in seed size and other components of maize yield (e.g., hundred kernel weight, number of rows per ear, number of kernels per row). In total, ten QTL affecting kernel size were identified, three of which (two for kernel length and one for kernel width) had stable expression in other components of maize yield. The possible genetic mechanism behind the trade-off of kernel size and yield components was discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Chen, Jiafa","Zhang, Luyan","Liu, Songtao","Li, Zhimin","Huang, Rongrong","Li, Yongming","Cheng, Hongliang","Li, Xiantang","Zhou, Bo","Wu, Suowei","Chen, Wei","Wu, Jianyu","Ding, Junqiang"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0153428","first_seen_on":"2016-08-23T13:03:39+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1471957402,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27070143?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27070143","pubdate":"2016-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0153428","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"The Genetic Basis of Natural Variation in Kernel Size and Related Traits Using a Four-Way Cross Population in Maize","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-basis-natural-variation-kernel-size-related-traits-using-fourway-cross-population-maize"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":7149194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253431,"mean":12.378645795683,"rank":213671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253431,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114437,"mean":10.588461585515,"rank":96543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114437,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4296,"mean":10.351020256112,"rank":3749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4296,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
