Serum levels of sIL-2R\u03b1 and IL-2 were measured using ELISA test.\nWe found significantly (p = 0.027) increased sIL-2R\u03b1 serum levels in BCC patients, in comparison to healthy controls. Statistically (p = 0.04) higher sIL-2R\u03b1 levels were observed in patients with more advanced tumours. Serum levels of sIL-2R\u03b1 showed a significant linear (r = 0.24, p = 0.018) correlation with tumour size. The average IL-2 serum levels in BCC patients were statistically (p = 0.039) decreased compared to controls. Significantly (p = 0.0454) lower median IL-2 levels were observed in patients with more advanced tumours. A negative correlation between sIL-2R\u03b1 and IL-2 serum concentrations was revealed (r = -0.22; p = 0.027).\nOur results testify to the importance of the IL-2\/sIL-2R\u03b1 signalling pathway in pathogenesis of BCC, suggesting that IL-2 and sIL-2R\u03b1 might be considered as potential markers of disease and targets for immunotherapy in BCC patients.","authors":["Sobjanek, Michal","Bien, Ewa","Zablotna, Monika","Sokolowska-Wojdylo, Malgorzata","Sikorska, Monika","Lange, Magdalena","Nowicki, Roman"],"doi":"10.5114\/pdia.2015.55177","first_seen_on":"2016-08-23T18:26:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2299-0046","1642-395X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Advances in Dermatology and Allergology\/Post\u0119py Dermatologii i Alergologii","last_mentioned_on":1471976751,"links":["http:\/\/www.termedia.pl\/Soluble-interleukin-2-receptor-and-interleukin-2-serum-levels-in-patients-with-basal-cell-carcinoma,7,26036,1,1.html"],"pmid":"27605896","pubdate":"2016-09-09T22:04:48+00:00","title":"Soluble interleukin-2 receptor \u03b1 and interleukin-2 serum levels in patients with basal cell carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"33"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AdvDermAllergol\/statuses\/768152288900870144","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10784278],"posted_on":"2016-08-23T18:25:51+00:00","author":{"name":"AdvDermatolAllergol","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/737673891225698304\/KOGgWvdl_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"AdvDermAllergol","tweeter_id":"737672453732847616","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":12},"tweet_id":"768152288900870144"}]}}
