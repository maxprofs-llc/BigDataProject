Lidocaine is often mixed with injectable dermal fillers to reduce injection pain. A new formulation of CaHA has been developed with the convenience of integral 0.3% lidocaine, CaHA (+).<br \/> This multicenter, split-face, double-blind study randomized subjects to receive treatment with CaHA (+) in one NLF and CaHA without lidocaine in the contralateral NLF. The pain level for each NLF was evaluated immediately following the injection using a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS), and every 15 minutes for 60 minutes plus follow-up visits. Additional endpoints included aesthetic outcomes and subject preference. All subjects (N=102) received treatment.<br \/> CaHA (+) treatment resulted in a statistically and clinically significant reduction in pain ratings immediately after injection compared with CaHA. The mean difference in VAS scores for pain was -4.41 (<em>P<\/em>&lt;0.0001). In 90% of subjects, the VAS scores were \u22652.0 cm lower for the CaHA (+)-treated NLF. A significant reduction in pain ratings throughout the first hour after injection was observed with CaHA (+) compared with CaHA (<em>P<\/em>&lt;0.0001). Both treatment groups achieved significant aesthetic improvement; however, the pain differential resulted in a subject-reported preference for CaHA (+). CaHA (+) with integral lidocaine significantly reduces pain and is as effective as CaHA.<br \/><br \/> <em>J Drugs Dermatol<\/em>. 2016;15(8):1005-1010.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa7053cf058f61000a4d4","authors":["Schachter, Daniel","Bertucci, Vince","Solish, Nowell"],"first_seen_on":"2016-08-23T17:03:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1545-9616"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Drugs in Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1493201005,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27538003?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27538003?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27538003","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Calcium Hydroxylapatite With Integral Lidocaine Provides Improved Pain Control for the Correction of Nasolabial Folds.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/calcium-hydroxylapatite-integral-lidocaine-provides-improved-pain-control-correction-nasolabial-fold"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083342,"mean":6.8946797770799,"rank":5843640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1951355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083342,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251277,"mean":12.38709492351,"rank":165201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":71497,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251277,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":536,"mean":2.7708373831776,"rank":296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":536,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.1071428571429,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ducrest\/statuses\/768131561363480576","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10783464],"posted_on":"2016-08-23T17:03:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Dominique du Crest","url":"http:\/\/www.skinaid.eu\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1474773419\/image_normal.jpg","description":"#Evidence as guiding star!Curating #skin science.
