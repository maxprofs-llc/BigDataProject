However, the majority of mHealth projects do not expand beyond the pilot stage. A core reason why is because they do not account for the individual needs and wants of those involved. A collaborative approach is needed to integrate the perspectives of all stakeholders into the design and operation of mHealth endeavours. Design thinking is a methodology used to develop and evaluate novel concepts for systems. With roots in participatory processes and self-determined pathways, design thinking provides a compelling framework to understand and apply the needs of diverse stakeholders to mHealth project development through a highly iterative process. The methodology presented in this article provides a structured approach to apply design thinking principles to assess the feasibility of novel mHealth endeavours during early conceptualisation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f61000404b","authors":["Molly Eckman"],"doi":"10.1080\/03091902.2016.1218560","endpage":"9","first_seen_on":"2016-08-23T13:21:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1464-522X","0309-1902"],"journal":"Journal of Medical Engineering & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1471958549,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/03091902.2016.1218560"],"pmid":"27535325","pubdate":"2016-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["healthservicesresearch","biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Leveraging design thinking to build sustainable mobile health systems","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/leveraging-design-thinking-build-sustainable-mobile-health-systems"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":5977192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1994600,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253430,"mean":12.37868339456,"rank":165359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":73203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253430,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":2.5748545454545,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.33125,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
