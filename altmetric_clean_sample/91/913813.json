We hypothesize that gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are heterogeneous with regard to these signaling pathways and these differences could have a significant impact on the outcome of clinical trials. We selected 120 well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors including tumors originating in pancreas (n=74), ileum (n=31), and rectum (n=15). Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue microarrays using the following antibodies: NOTCH1, HES1, HEY1, pIGF1R, and FGF2. Gene profiling study was performed by using human genome U133A 2.0 array and data were analyzed. The gene profiling results were selectively confirmed by using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. Initial immunohistochemical analysis showed NOTCH1 was uniformly expressed in rectal neuroendocrine tumors (100%), a subset of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (34%), and negative in ileal neuroendocrine tumors. Similarly, a downstream target of NOTCH1, HES1 was preferentially expressed in rectal neuroendocrine tumors (64%), a subset of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (10%), and uniformly negative in ileal neuroendocrine tumors. Messenger RNAs for NOTCH1, HES1, and HEY1 were 2.32-, 2.44-, and 2.39-folds, respectively, higher in rectal neuroendocrine tumors as compared with ileal neuroendocrine tumors. Global gene expression profiling showed 95 genes were differentially expressed in small intestinal vs rectal neuroendocrine tumors, with changes as high as 50-fold. These genes were concentrated in several signal transduction pathways including cancer endocrine pathway and cell growth\/proliferation pathway. The differential expression of selected genes including ISL LIM homeobox 1, cathepsin B, glucagon, and tryptophan hydroxylase 1 were confirmed by qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Our results confirm the heterogeneity in signaling pathways of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. NOTCH1 inhibitors are unlikely to provide benefit in ileal neuroendocrine tumors; conversely, their efficacy in rectal neuroendocrine tumors needs further study. Further analysis of signaling pathways is critical for designing clinical trials in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008eb7","authors":["Wang H","Chen Y","Fernandez-Del Castillo C","Yilmaz O","Deshpande V"],"doi":"10.1038\/modpathol.2012.143","first_seen_on":"2012-08-27T02:39:35+00:00","issns":["0893-3952","1530-0285"],"issue":"","journal":"Modern Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1346139129,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22918166?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/modpathol\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/modpathol2012143a.html"],"pmid":"22918166","pubdate":"2012-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Heterogeneity in signaling pathways of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: a critical look at notch signaling pathway","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/heterogeneity-signaling-pathways-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-critical-look-notch-si-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616992,"mean":4.9287830669226,"rank":1724643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1828412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616992,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75193,"mean":5.1006529418023,"rank":27987,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":45302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75193,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":747,"mean":2.7281930294906,"rank":324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":747,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.0370967741935,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/renelaennec\/status\/240351043865677824","rt":["Affymetrix"],"citation_ids":[913813],"posted_on":"2012-08-28T07:32:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Ren\u00e9 Laennec","url":"http:\/\/symposium-biopathology.eu","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/566655725116461057\/aoYhgp9x_normal.jpeg","description":"The Rene Laennec Twitter is maintained by @jcfournet and dedicated to clinical genomics and everything fresh, fun, new, shaking and inspiring in biomedicine...","id_on_source":"renelaennec","tweeter_id":"96720499","geo":{"lt":48.85341,"ln":2.3488,"country":"FR"},"followers":687},"tweet_id":"240351043865677824"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NicholasMMurphy\/statuses\/239914305372446720","license":"public","citation_ids":[913813],"posted_on":"2012-08-27T02:36:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Nick Murphy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/978677061\/345_n_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"NicholasMMurphy","tweeter_id":"74478819","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":814},"tweet_id":"239914305372446720"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/Affymetrix\/status\/240150603341365248","citation_ids":[913813],"posted_on":"2012-08-27T18:15:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Affymetrix, Inc.","url":"http:\/\/thermofisher.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3756447394\/5a9dfec5ce5b6914d509f8769d6dd4da_normal.png","description":"Rapidly translating cell, protein, and genetic research to clinical practice and routine use.
