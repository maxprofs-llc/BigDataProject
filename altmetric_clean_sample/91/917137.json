In this present work, the main \u03b2-glucosidase of A.\u00a0saccharolyticus responsible for the efficient hydrolytic activity was identified, isolated, and characterized. Ion exchange chromatography was used to fractionate the culture broth, yielding fractions with high \u03b2-glucosidase activity and only 1 visible band on an SDS-PAGE gel. Mass spectrometry analysis of this band gave peptide matches to \u03b2-glucosidases from aspergilli. Through a polymerase chain reaction approach using degenerate primers and genome walking, a 2919 bp sequence encoding the 860 amino acid BGL1 polypeptide was determined. BGL1 of A.\u00a0saccharolyticus has 91% and 82% identity with BGL1 from Aspergillus aculeatus and BGL1 from Aspergillus niger , respectively, both belonging to Glycoside Hydrolase family 3. Homology modeling studies suggested \u03b2-glucosidase activity with preserved retaining mechanism and a wider catalytic pocket compared with other \u03b2-glucosidases. The bgl1 gene was heterologously expressed in Trichoderma reesei QM6a, purified, and characterized by enzyme kinetics studies. The enzyme can hydrolyze cellobiose, p-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-d-glucoside, and cellodextrins. The enzyme showed good thermostability, was stable at 50\u00a0\u00b0C, and at 60\u00a0\u00b0C it had a half-life of approximately 6\u00a0h.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000da6","authors":["Annette S\u00f8rensen","Birgitte K.
