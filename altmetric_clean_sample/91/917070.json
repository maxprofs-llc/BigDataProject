Separate evidence suggests that patients may lack awareness of these deficits and may even be overly confident with self-appraisals. The extent to which these separately or together represent prodromes of the disorder versus a consequence of the disorder remains unclear. The present study sought to test whether risk for bipolar disorder in a younger, college-aged cohort of individuals would be associated with lower performance in cognitive ability yet higher self-appraisal of cognitive functioning.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c6c","authors":["Crystal Rodriguez","Camilo J.
