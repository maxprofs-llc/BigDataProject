These topics have been hotly debated within the profession for several decades, with each side presenting cogent arguments. The debate is also characterized by strong passion and emotions on both sides that are not easily reconciled. Dermatologists and their patients are best served by an objective, organized approach to clearly delineating the various aspects of these issues and providing guidelines for practitioners that can be shared with patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002580","authors":["Baumann L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.clindermatol.2011.06.023","first_seen_on":"2012-08-28T22:29:30+00:00","issns":["0738-081X","0738081X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Clinics in Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1379330840,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0738081X11001635"],"pmid":"22902224","pubdate":"2012-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Ethics in cosmetic dermatology ","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ethics-cosmetic-dermatology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630815,"mean":4.9285062716012,"rank":2899138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630815,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75151,"mean":5.0502756620093,"rank":55512,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75151,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289,"mean":2.0305416666667,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
