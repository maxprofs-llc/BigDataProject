This pilot study investigated the effect of supplemental DHA on cognitive performance in 33 females with PKU ages 12-47 years. Participants were randomly assigned to receive DHA (10mg\/kg\/day) or placebo for 4.5 months. Performance on cognitive processing speed and executive functioning tasks was evaluated at baseline and follow up. Intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses were performed. At follow up, biomarkers of DHA status were significantly higher in the DHA-supplemented group. Performance on the cognitive tasks and reported treatment-related adverse events did not differ. While no evidence of cognitive effect was seen, a larger sample size is needed to be conclusive, which may not be feasible in this population. Supplementation was a safe and effective way to increase biomarkers of DHA status (www.clinicaltrials.gov; Identifier: NCT00892554).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008641","authors":["Singh, R.H."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.plefa.2011.09.004","first_seen_on":"2012-08-26T20:07:05+00:00","issns":["0952-3278"],"journal":"Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids","last_mentioned_on":1331728125,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0952327811001256"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.plefa.com\/article\/S0952-3278(11)00125-6\/pdf","pmid":"22000478","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of supplemental docosahexaenoic acid on cognitive processing speed and executive function in females of reproductive age with phenylketonuria: A pilot study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/randomized-placebocontrolled-doubleblind-trial-supplemental-docosahexaenoic-acid-cognitive-processin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636264,"mean":4.9211313967159,"rank":2901502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636264,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75094,"mean":5.0542618619578,"rank":55370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75094,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273,"mean":3.6942867647059,"rank":205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":6.4625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
