A total of 240 water samples were collected from selected sites in Acheron and Kalamas Rivers and the Ionian Sea coast in north western Greece. The samples were analyzed for Salmonella spp., Listeria spp., Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli O157, Staphylococci, Pseudomonas spp., Total Coliforms, Fecal Coliforms, Fecal Streptococci, Total Heterotrophic Flora at 20\u00b0C and at 37\u00b0C, fungi and protozoa (Cryptosporidium, Giardia). Susceptibility tests to nine antimicrobials (ampicillin, amikacin, amoxicillin\/clavulavic acid, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, tetracycline, ticarcillin\/clavulanic acid, ampicillin\/sulbactam) were performed using the disk diffusion method for Salmonella isolates. We isolated 28 serovars of Salmonella spp. identified as Salmonella enteritidis (23), Salmonella thompson (3) and Salmonella virchow (2). Multi-drug resistant Salmonella serovars were isolated from both river and marine waters, with 34.8% of S. enteritidis and 100% of S. virchow being resistant to more than 3 antibiotics. Also we isolated 42 strains of Listeria spp. identified as L. monocytogenes (20), L. innocua (9), L. seeligeri (2) and L. ivanovii (11). All the Listeria isolates were susceptible to the tested antibiotics. No Campylobacter spp., E. coli O157, Cryptosporidium and Giardia were detected. The overall ranges (and average counts) of the indicator bacteria were: Total Coliforms 0-4\u00d710(4)cfu\/100ml (3.7\u00d710(3)cfu\/100ml), Fecal Coliforms 0-9\u00d710(3)cfu\/100ml (9.2\u00d710(2)cfu\/100ml), Fecal Streptococci 0-3.5\u00d710(4)cfu\/100ml (1.4\u00d710(3)cfu\/100ml), Total Heterotrophic Flora at 20\u00b0C 0-6\u00d710(3)cfu\/ml (10(3)cfu\/ml) and at 37\u00b0C 0-5\u00d710(3)cfu\/ml (4.9\u00d710(2)cfu\/ml). Weak or non significant positive Spearman correlations (p<0.05, rs range: 0.13-0.77) were obtained between Salmonella, Listeria, fungi and indicator bacteria. The results underline the complexity of the interrelations between pathogens and indicator bacteria, and the necessity to assess the presence of resistant bacteria in the aquatic environments.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b5b","authors":["Economou V","Gousia P","Kansouzidou A","Sakkas H","Karanis P","Papadopoulou C"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijheh.2012.07.004","first_seen_on":"2012-08-26T16:31:09+00:00","issns":["1438-4639"],"issue":"","journal":"International Journal of Hygiene & Environmental Health","last_mentioned_on":1345998505,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22901425"],"pmid":"22901425","pubdate":"2012-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier GmbH.","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Prevalence, antimicrobial resistance and relation to indicator and pathogenic microorganisms of Salmonella enterica isolated from surface waters within an agricultural landscape.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-antimicrobial-resistance-relation-indicator-pathogenic-microorganisms-salmonella-enterica"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":978068,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78353,"mean":5.3979680161323,"rank":51115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":18815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78353,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230,"mean":4.1403056768559,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.33,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
