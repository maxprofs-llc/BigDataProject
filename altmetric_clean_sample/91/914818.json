However, recent studies have shown that new graduate nurses report their extent of research use as relatively low. Because behavior intention is a well-known predictor of subsequent behavior, this gives reasons to further investigate graduating nursing students' intentions to use research in clinical practice after undergraduate study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b81","authors":["Rudman, Ann","Henrietta Forsman","Lars Wallin","Petter Gustavsson","Ann Rudman"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijnurstu.2012.04.002","endpage":"1164","first_seen_on":"2012-08-27T15:08:53+00:00","issns":["0020-7489","00207489"],"issue":"9","journal":"International Journal of Nursing Studies","last_mentioned_on":1346663514,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0020748912001228"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.journalofnursingstudies.com\/article\/S0020-7489(12)00122-8\/pdf","pmid":"22564505","pubdate":"2012-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"1155","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Nursing students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 intentions to use research as a predictor of use one year post graduation: A prospective study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0020748912001228","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nursing-students-intentions-research-predictor-one-year-post-graduation-prospective-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635050,"mean":4.9227315329755,"rank":2900916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635050,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75288,"mean":5.0481271667087,"rank":55525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75288,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":495,"mean":3.515955465587,"rank":426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":495,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":4.190625,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
