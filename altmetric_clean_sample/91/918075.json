This study was carried out to evaluate the prevalence of C. difficile in 150 rectal swab samples collected from cattle and goats in Switzerland. The overall prevalence of C. difficile was 6.6%. The isolates belonged to the PCR ribotypes 033, 066, 070, 003, 001 and 137. In addition, the occurrence of C. difficile in faecal samples collected from farm ground was also evaluated and C. difficile was detected in 21% (7\/30) of these samples. These isolates belonged to ribotypes 033, 066, 014 and 137. Several isolates pertained to ribotypes known to cause Clostridium difficile infections in humans.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003764","authors":["Romano, V.","Albanese, F.","Dumontet, S.","Krovacek, K.","Petrini, O.","Pasquale, V."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1863-2378.2012.01540.x","endpage":"548","first_seen_on":"2012-08-29T00:41:40+00:00","issns":["1863-2378","1863-1959"],"issue":"8","journal":"Zoonoses & Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1346200715,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1863-2378.2012.01540.x\/abstract;jsessionid=49660EB1307326DB641C3441A2B7B592.d01t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1863-2378.2012.01540.x\/pdf","pmid":"22925279","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"545","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Prevalence and Genotypic Characterization of Clostridium difficile From Ruminants in Switzerland","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-genotypic-characterization-clostridium-difficile-ruminants-switzerland"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627006,"mean":4.9509722374284,"rank":2906996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627006,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75381,"mean":5.0781866808172,"rank":55895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75381,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201,"mean":3.50467,"rank":179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.19,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
