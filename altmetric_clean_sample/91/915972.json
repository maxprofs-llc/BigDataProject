However, a subset of this population encounters significant difficulties with opioid therapy (OT). These problems include protracted adverse effects, as well as misuse, abuse, and addiction, which can result in significant morbidity and mortality and make informed consent an important consideration. Opioid treatment agreements (OTAs), which may include documentation of informed consent, have been used to promote the safe use of opioids for pain. There is a debate regarding the effectiveness of OTAs in reducing the risk of opioid misuse; however, most practitioners recognize that OTAs provide an opportunity to discuss the potential risks and benefits of OT and establish mutually agreed-on treatment goals, a clear plan of treatment, and circumstances for continuation and discontinuation of opioids. Informed consent is an important component of an OTA but not often the focus of consideration in discussions of OTAs. This article examines the principles, process, and content of informed consent for OT of pain in the context of OTAs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002ea6","authors":["Martin D.
