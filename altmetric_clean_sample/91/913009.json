Platelets, in addition to possessing functional miRNA processing machinery, have miRNA levels that have been correlated with platelet reactivity, and these miRNAs have been shown to target mRNAs that encode proteins that alter platelet function. There are potential uses of platelet miRNA as biomarkers and therapeutic agents. Due to the ability of platelets to release miRNA-containing microparticles at sites of activation, including angiogenic regions, tumors, and atherosclerotic plaques, there is the possibility of engineering platelets to deliver miRNA-based therapies to these sites. Cellpreferential expression of miRNAs could be exploited to restrict transgene expression in hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy to the desired lineage, including megakaryocytes and platelets. Finally, manipulation of gene expression in stored platelets may allow more effective platelet storage. Although much work remains to be done, there is great potential in miRNA-based platelet therapies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000cf04","doi":"10.1007\/978-3-642-29423-5_17","first_seen_on":"2012-08-26T09:00:11+00:00","issns":["0171-2004"],"issue":"210","journal":"Handbook of experimental pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1345985968,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22918741?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22918741","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Molecular Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Small RNAs as Potential Platelet Therapeutics.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/small-rnas-potential-platelet-therapeutics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":1990174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2420459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78356,"mean":5.425697402846,"rank":29881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":46184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78356,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225,"mean":2.6494017857143,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":11.116666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
