In this research, we focus on emotional disclosure on Facebook. We conducted two studies, and results from both self-report and observer rating show that individuals are more likely to express positive relative to negative emotions and present better emotional well-being on Facebook than in real life. Our study is the first to demonstrate impression management on Facebook through emotional disclosure. We discuss important theoretical and practical implications of our study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c1","authors":["Lin Qiu","Han Lin","Angela K.-y.
