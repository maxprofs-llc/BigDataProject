If growth is not possible, cells may eventually promote autophagy, differentiation, or apoptosis. Microorganisms interrupt their growth and differentiate under general nutrient limitation. We analyzed the effects of phosphate limitation on growth and sporulation in the chytridiomycete Blastocladiella emersonii using kinetic data, phase-contrast, and laser confocal microscopy. Under phosphate limitation, zoospores germinated and subsequently formed 2-4 spores, regardless of the nutritional content of the medium. The removal of phosphate at any time during growth induced sporulation of vegetative cells. If phosphate was later added to the same cultures, growth was restored if the cells were not yet committed to sporulation. The cycles of addition and withdrawal of phosphate from growth medium resulted in cycles of germination-growth, germination-sporulation, or germination-growth-sporulation. These results show that phosphate limitation is sufficient to interrupt cell growth and to induce complete sporulation in B.\u00a0emersonii. We concluded that the determination of growth or sporulation in this microorganism is linked to phosphate availability when other nutrients are not limiting. This result provides a new tool for the dissection of nutrient-energy and signal pathways in cell growth and differentiation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000da6","authors":["Vagner Alexandre Bongiorno","Angela Ferreira da Cruz","Antonio Nunis da Silva","Luiz Carlos Corr\u00eaa"],"doi":"10.1139\/w2012-090","endpage":"1111","first_seen_on":"2012-08-28T14:07:21+00:00","issns":["0008-4166","1480-3275"],"journal":"Canadian Journal of Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1346140990,"links":["http:\/\/www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1139\/w2012-090"],"pmid":"22913304","pubdate":"2012-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1104","title":"Phosphate limitation induces sporulation in the chytridiomycete","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phosphate-limitation-induces-sporulation-chytridiomycete-blastocladiella-emersonii"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629179,"mean":4.9362043867828,"rank":2901562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629179,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75135,"mean":5.0610820667075,"rank":55600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75135,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":420,"mean":1.9774892601432,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":420,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.32142857142857,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
