Two injections of the trisaccharide-tetanus toxoid conjugate administered with alum induced a robust secondary antibody response in rabbits with trisaccharide specific IgG ELISA titers in excess of 1:100,000. Fluorescent labeling studies demonstrated these antibodies (i) recognized the cell wall \u03b2-mannan of C. albicans on hyphae and budding cells and (ii) C. albicans incubated with immune sera bound complement factor C3. The synthetic conjugate vaccine but not the carrier protein, tetanus toxoid reduced Candida load in vaccinated rabbits subsequently rendered leukocytopenic by injection of cyclophosphamide and then challenged with live C. albicans. These data support the contention that antibody mediated immunity plays a role in combating C. albicans infections and suggests that a surprisingly simple, readily accessible synthetic conjugate vaccine may have therapeutic potential.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ea","authors":["Lipinski T","Wu X","Sadowska J","Kreiter E","Yasui Y","Cheriaparambil S","Rennie R","Bundle DR","Tomasz Lipinski","Xiangyang Wu","Joanna Sadowska","Erin Kreiter","Yutaka Yasui","Shilton Cheriaparambil","Robert Rennie","David R.
