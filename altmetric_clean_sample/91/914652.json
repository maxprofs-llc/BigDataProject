In this work, we developed a new generation bioprobe by integrating tetraphenylsilole, a fluorogenic unit with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristic, with cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid tripeptide (cRGD), a targeting ligand to integrin \u03b1(v)\u03b2(3) receptor. Emission of the AIE probe is switched on upon its specific binding to integrin \u03b1(v)\u03b2(3), which allows quantitative detection of integrin \u03b1(v)\u03b2(3) in solution and real-time imaging of the binding process between cRGD and integrin \u03b1(v)\u03b2(3) on cell membrane. The probe can be used for tracking integrin \u03b1(v)\u03b2(3) and for identifying integrin \u03b1(v)\u03b2(3)-positive cancer cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Haibin Shi"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja302369e","first_seen_on":"2012-08-27T14:49:42+00:00","issns":["0002-7863"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1338848632,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/full\/10.1021\/ja302369e"],"pmid":"22642547","pubdate":"2012-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Specific Detection of Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 by Light-Up Bioprobe with Aggregation-Induced Emission Characteristics","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/specific-detection-integrin-v-3-lightup-bioprobe-aggregationinduced-emission-characteristics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3072965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":950651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78560,"mean":5.4475025904098,"rank":50566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":15677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78560,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15478,"mean":4.1037725657427,"rank":11764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2913,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15478,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":494,"mean":4.1160730223124,"rank":306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":494,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
