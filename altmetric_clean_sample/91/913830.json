While the overall inclusiveness has now been mostly agreed on and 20 families recognised, the phylogenetic relationships among the families are largely unknown. We here present a phylogenetic hypothesis for Sylvioidea based on one mitochondrial and six nuclear markers, in total ~6.3 kbp, for 79 ingroup species representing all currently recognised families and some species with uncertain affinities, making this the most comprehensive analysis of this taxon.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b5","authors":["Silke Fregin","Martin Haase","Urban Olsson","Per Alstr\u00f6m"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2148-12-157","first_seen_on":"2012-08-27T03:01:09+00:00","issns":["","1471-2148"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Evolutionary Biology","last_mentioned_on":1470150590,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/12\/157\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/12\/157","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2148-12-157"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/1471-2148-12-157?site=bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"22920688","pubdate":"2012-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Systematics\/Taxonomy\/Biogeography","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Entomology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics and Population Dynamics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"157","subjects":["biology"],"title":"New insights into family relationships within the avian superfamily Sylvioidea (Passeriformes) based on seven molecular markers","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-insights-family-relationships-within-avian-superfamily-sylvioidea-passeriformes-based-seven-mole"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155605,"mean":6.9067370031636,"rank":1597364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6523299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155605,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99729,"mean":6.0027986122253,"rank":18872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":80464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99729,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1967,"mean":9.1822217700915,"rank":696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":1264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1967,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":9.7612203389831,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
