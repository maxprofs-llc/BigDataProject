This study aimed to determine whether the success rate and pain of intravenous cannulation is affected by prior injection of intradermal lidocaine. Intravenous cannulation was performed twice in 45 healthy volunteers. Intradermal lidocaine was administered prior to one of these cannulations. The outcome measures were success or failure of cannulation, and pain of cannulation, measured with a 100 mm visual analogue pain scale. The success rate of intravenous cannulation with and without prior intradermal lidocaine was 54% and 76%, respectively. The difference was 22.0% (95% CI 1.5-27.8%; P = 0.03). Log-linear analysis for three-way interaction between the variables (outcome, vascular condition and use of lidocaine) showed a significant influence of vascular condition on outcome (G(2) 24.6, P < 0.001). The mean (SD) pain scores in the control and intervention group were 34.8 (21.0) and 13.6 (13.2) mm, respectively. The difference between the mean pain scores was 21.2 mm (95% CI 15.1-27.3 mm). In conclusion, the success rate of intravenous cannulation may be reduced with the use of intradermal lidocaine, but success rate is primarily dependent on vascular condition. Intradermal lidocaine achieves a clinically significant reduction in the pain of intravenous cannulation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088cd","authors":["Hendry F","Checketts MR","McLeod GA"],"doi":"10.1258\/smj.2011.011160","first_seen_on":"2012-08-29T10:14:24+00:00","issns":["0036-9330"],"issue":"4","journal":"Scottish Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1346235096,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22089042?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22089042","pubdate":"2011-11-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Effect of intradermal anaesthesia on success rate and pain of intravenous cannulation: a randomized non-blind crossover study.","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-intradermal-anaesthesia-success-rate-pain-intravenous-cannulation-randomized-nonblind-crossov"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634360,"mean":4.9196455088828,"rank":2898082,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634360,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75421,"mean":5.0444381861575,"rank":55580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75421,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":3.6100672268908,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.87,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
