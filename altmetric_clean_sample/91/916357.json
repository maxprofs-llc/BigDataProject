Since then, the model has undergone ups and downs marked by the technical and conceptual advancements made in the field of T lymphocyte activation. Here, I describe the development of the model and survey recent literature providing evidence either for or against the idea that serial TCR\/pMHC engagement might contribute to T lymphocyte activation. I also discuss how the concept of serial TCR engagement might be useful in the design of immunotherapeutic approaches aimed at potentiating T lymphocyte responses in vivo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90c3cf058f61000cb02","authors":["Salvatore Valitutti"],"doi":"10.3389\/fimmu.2012.00272","first_seen_on":"2012-08-28T05:35:39+00:00","issns":["1664-3224"],"journal":"Frontiers in immunology","last_mentioned_on":1346131970,"links":["http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/T_Cell_Biology\/10.3389\/fimmu.2012.00272\/abstract"],"pmid":"22973273","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"The Serial Engagement Model 17\u2009Years After: From TCR Triggering to Immunotherapy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serial-engagement-model-17-years-after-fromtcr-triggering-immunotherapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3544766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78442,"mean":5.4087534580131,"rank":61882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78442,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1849,"mean":1.9927359307359,"rank":1616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1849,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
