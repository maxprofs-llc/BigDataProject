Previously established methods were used to predetermine the path, activation timing and resultant force contribution of 27 individual muscle segments at any given joint position. Artificial boundary conditions were applied in a three-dimensional finite element model of the joint and progressively released until the humeral head was completely free to rotate and translate within the fixed glenoid according to the compressive component of the predetermined resultant force. The shear component was then added such that no boundary conditions other than muscular force were applied. The framework was exploited to simulate elevation as a composite of instantaneous positions and theoretically demonstrate that joint stability can be achieved exclusively through muscular activity. Predicted muscle moment arms, muscle activation timing, humeral head translations, joint contact forces and stability ratio were comparable with existing experimental and in vivo data. This framework could be valuable for subject specific modeling and may be used to address clinical hypotheses related to shoulder joint stability that cannot be pursued using simplified modeling approaches.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002ccf","doi":"10.1016\/j.jbiomech.2012.06.010","first_seen_on":"2012-08-24T20:49:41+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Biomechanics","last_mentioned_on":1342875764,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0021929012003429&_version=1&md5=b8caa8eca6f1fbc81cdcc45bae086409"],"pmid":"22818663","pubdate":"2012-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"An integrated model of active glenohumeral stability.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/integrated-model-active-glenohumeral-stability"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616992,"mean":4.9289679233405,"rank":2902746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616992,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74976,"mean":5.0752900833611,"rank":55646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74976,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":628,"mean":2.3127655502392,"rank":434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":628,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":0.565,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
