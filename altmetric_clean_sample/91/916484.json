This 'human genomics' information revolution has occurred as a backdrop to a rapid increase in the rates of many human disorders and diseases. For example, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, asthma, autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have increased at rates that cannot be due to changes in the genetic structure of the population, and are difficult to ascribe to changes in diagnostic criteria or ascertainment. A likely cause of the increased incidence of these disorders is increased exposure to environmental factors that modify gene function. Many environmental factors that have epidemiological association with common human disorders are likely to exert their effects through epigenetic alterations. This general mechanism of gene-environment interaction poses special challenges for individuals, educators, scientists and public policy makers in defining, monitoring and mitigating exposures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f6100072c9","authors":["Keith E Latham","Carmen Sapienza","Nora Engel","Latham KE","Sapienza C","Engel N"],"doi":"10.2217\/epi.12.31","endpage":"402","first_seen_on":"2012-08-28T08:29:20+00:00","funders":["nci","nigms"],"issns":["1750-192X","1750-1911"],"issue":"4","journal":"Epigenomics","last_mentioned_on":1469432220,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22920179","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3471221\/"],"pmid":"22920179","pubdate":"2012-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"383","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"The epigenetic lorax: gene\u2013environment interactions in human health","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epigenetic-lorax-geneenvironment-interactions-human-health-9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.69,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.69},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082038,"mean":6.8946982576228,"rank":982700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7100349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082038,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99519,"mean":6.0077558833578,"rank":11967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":87549,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99519,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":479,"mean":3.883410041841,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":479,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.6,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
