This study was undertaken to determine whether decontaminants might give a competitive advantage to pathogenic bacteria on poultry and involve a potential risk to consumer. A total of 144 chicken legs were co-inoculated with similar concentrations of pathogenic bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis or Escherichia coli) and spoilage bacteria (Brochothrix thermosphacta or Pseudomonas fluorescens). Samples were dipped for 15min in solutions (w\/v) of trisodium phosphate (12%; TSP), acidified sodium chlorite (1200ppm; ASC), citric acid (2%; CA), peroxyacids (220ppm; PA) or chlorine dioxide (50ppm; CD), or were left untreated (control). Microbiological analyses were carried out on day 0 and every 24h until day 7 of storage (at 10\u00b11\u00b0C). The modified Gompertz equation was used as the primary model to fit observed data. TSP, ASC and CA were effective in extending the lag phase (L, ranging from 1.47\u00b11.34days to 4.06\u00b11.16days) and in decreasing the concentration of bacteria during the stationary phase (D, ranging from 2.46\u00b10.51 log(10) cfu\/cm(2) to 8.64\u00b10.53 log(10) cfu\/cm(2)), relative to the control samples (L values ranging from 0.59\u00b10.38days and 2.52\u00b12.28days, and D values ranging from 6.32\u00b10.89 log(10) cfu\/cm(2) to 9.39\u00b10.39 log(10) cfu\/cm(2), respectively). Both on untreated and on most decontaminated samples the overgrowth of spoilage bacteria among the species tested was observed throughout storage, suggesting that spoilage would occur prior to any noteworthy increase in the levels of pathogenic microorganisms. However, L. monocytogenes counts similar to, or higher than, those for spoilage bacteria were observed on samples treated with TSP, ASC or CA, suggesting that these treatments might pose a danger to consumers. However, these results derive from laboratory-based experiments testing artificially-inoculated bacteria. Further investigations of the natural micro-biota of poultry carcasses would be appropriate in order to substantiate these findings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b4f","authors":["Alicia Alonso-Hernando","Rosa Capita","Carlos Alonso-Calleja"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.08.011","first_seen_on":"2012-08-28T03:36:27+00:00","issns":["01681605"],"journal":"International Journal of Food Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1346124808,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0168160512004369"],"pmid":"23072701","pubdate":"2012-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Behaviour of co-inoculated pathogenic and spoilage bacteria on poultry following several decontamination treatments","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/behaviour-coinoculated-pathogenic-spoilage-bacteria-poultry-following-several-decontamination-treatm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4010909,"mean":5.0312478775642,"rank":3208152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":98389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4010909,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76569,"mean":5.1279750809737,"rank":56811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76569,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":863,"mean":2.1676519721578,"rank":545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":863,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":0.33552631578947,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
