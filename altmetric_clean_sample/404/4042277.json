Previous studies using Xenopus oocytes, yeast cells or purified isoforms demonstrated that affinities of various cardiac glycosides for three isoforms of the Na(+),K(+) ATPase (\u03b11-\u03b13\u03b21) may differ, a finding with potential clinical implication. The current study investigates isoform selectivity and effects of cardiac glycosides on cultured mammalian cells under more physiological conditions. H1299 cells (non-small cell lung carcinoma) were engineered to express only one \u03b1 isoform (\u03b11, \u03b12, or \u03b13) by combining stable transfection of isoforms and silencing endogenous \u03b11. Cardiac glycoside binding was measured by displacement of bound (3)H-ouabain. The experiments confirm moderate \u03b11\/\u03b13:\u03b12 selectivity of ouabain, moderate \u03b12:\u03b11 selectivity of digoxin and enhanced \u03b12:\u03b11 selectivity of synthetic derivatives (Katz et al J. Biol. Chem. (2014) 289, 21153-62). Relative \u03b12:\u03b11 selectivity of digoxin versus ouabain was also manifested by enhanced internalization of \u03b12 in response to digoxin. Cellular proliferation assays of H1299 cells confirmed the patterns of \u03b12:\u03b11 selectivity for ouabain, digoxin and a synthetic derivative, and reveal a crucial role of surface pump density on sensitivity to cardiac glycosides. Because cardiac glycosides are being considered as drugs for treatment of cancer, effects of ouabain on proliferation of twelve cancer and non-cancer cell lines, with variable plasma membrane expression of \u03b11, have been tested. These demonstrated that sensitivity to ouabain indeed depends linearly on the plasma membrane surface density of Na(+),K(+) ATPase irrespective of status, malignant or non-malignant.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000220d","authors":["Marina Cherniavsky Lev","Steven J D Karlish","Haim Garty"],"doi":"10.1152\/ajpcell.00089.2015","first_seen_on":"2015-05-22T13:43:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1522-1563"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology: Cell Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1437742217,"links":["http:\/\/ajpcell.physiology.org\/content\/early\/2015\/05\/18\/ajpcell.00089.2015","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25994790?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/ajpcell.physiology.org\/content\/309\/2\/C126"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajpcell.physiology.org\/http:\/\/ajpcell.physiology.org\/content\/ajpcell\/early\/2015\/05\/18\/ajpcell.00089.2015.full.pdf","pmid":"25994790","pubdate":"2015-05-23T22:06:19+00:00","publisher":"American Physiological Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","physiology"],"title":"Cardiac glycosides induced toxicity in human cells expressing \u03b11-, \u03b12-, or \u03b13-isoforms of Na-K-ATPase","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cardiac-glycosides-induced-toxicity-human-cells-expressing-%CE%B11-%CE%B12-%CE%B13isoforms-nakatpase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5395620,"mean":6.2970774415334,"rank":2490123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2770027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5395620,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176860,"mean":9.0528670522847,"rank":84287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":86511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176860,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":894,"mean":2.6243695408735,"rank":384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":894,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.74,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
