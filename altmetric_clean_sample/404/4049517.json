Glucosyl transfer to and from phosphate takes place by the partly rate-limiting interconversion of ternary enzyme-substrate complexes formed from binary enzyme-phosphate and enzyme-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl phosphate adducts respectively. To advance a model of the chemical mechanism of trehalose phosphorylase, we performed a steady-state kinetic study with the purified enzyme from the basidiomycete fungus Schizophyllum commune by using alternative substrates, inhibitors and combinations thereof in pairs as specific probes of substrate-binding recognition and transition-state structure. Orthovanadate is a competitive inhibitor against phosphate and alpha-d-glucopyranosyl phosphate, and binds 3 x 10(4)-fold tighter (K(i) approximately 1 microM) than phosphate. Structural alterations of d-glucose at C-2 and O-5 are tolerated by the enzyme at subsite +1. They lead to parallel effects of approximately the same magnitude (slope=1.14; r(2)=0.98) on the reciprocal catalytic efficiency for reverse glucosyl transfer [log (K(m)\/k(cat))] and the apparent affinity of orthovanadate determined in the presence of the respective glucosyl acceptor (log K(i)). An adduct of orthovanadate and the nucleophile\/leaving group bound at subsite +1 is therefore the true inhibitor and displays partial transition state analogy. Isofagomine binds to subsite -1 in the enzyme-phosphate complex with a dissociation constant of 56 microM and inhibits trehalose phosphorylase at least 20-fold better than 1-deoxynojirimycin. The specificity of the reversible azasugars inhibitors would be explained if a positive charge developed on C-1 rather than O-5 in the proposed glucosyl cation-like transition state of the reaction. The results are discussed in the context of alpha-retaining glucosyltransferase mechanisms that occur with and without a beta-glucosyl enzyme intermediate.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c1","authors":["Nidetzky, B","Eis, C"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-22T22:45:32+00:00","issns":["0264-6021"],"issue":"Pt 3","journal":"Biochemical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1197329783,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11736665","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1222278"],"pmcid":"PMC1222278","pmid":"11736665","pubdate":"2001-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Alpha-retaining glucosyl transfer catalysed by trehalose phosphorylase from Schizophyllum commune: mechanistic evidence obtained from steady-state kinetic studies with substrate analogues and inhibitors.","type":"article","volume":"360","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/%CE%B1retaining-glucosyl-transfer-catalysed-trehalose-phosphorylase-schizophyllum-commune-mechanistic-evi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3798422,"mean":5.0088551932535,"rank":868787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2400373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3798422,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57321,"mean":8.3752319958129,"rank":17914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":38484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57321,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3807,"mean":2.3986994219653,"rank":181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":1532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3807,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":2.304347826087,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Alpha,alpha-trehalose phosphorylase (configuration-retaining)","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=177094219#altmetric_citation_2","license":"public","citation_ids":[4049516,4049517,4049517],"posted_on":"2007-12-10T23:36:23+00:00","summary":"Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are alpha,alpha-trehalose and phosphate, whereas its two products are alpha-D-glucose and alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14650536","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"WillowW","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:WillowW"}}]}}
