The impact of other viral pathogens is unclear.\nEighty biopsies from left and right colon (n=63) and terminal ileum (n\u200a=\u200a17) were collected from 19 HIV-infected and 22 HIV-uninfected subjects. Levels of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) DNA were measured by droplet-digital (dd)PCR. Mucosal gene expression was measured via multiplex-assay. Microbiome analysis was performed using bacterial 16S-rDNA-pyrosequencing. The effect of CMV and EBV replication on the microbiome composition and mRNA-expression of selected cytokines (IL-6,IFN-\u03b3,IL-1\u03b2, CCL2,IL-8 IFN-\u03b21) was evaluated.\nOverall, CMV and EBV were detected in at least one intestinal site in 60.5% and 78.9% of subjects, respectively. HIV-infected individuals demonstrated less detectable CMV (p\u200a=\u200a0.04); CMV was more frequently detected in terminal ileum than colon (p\u200a=\u200a0.04). Detectable EBV was more frequent among HIV-infected (p\u200a=\u200a0.05) without differences by intestinal site. The number of operational taxonomic units did not differ by CMV or EBV detection status. Among HIV-infected subjects, higher CMV was only associated with lower relative abundance of Actinobacteria in the ileum (p\u200a=\u200a0.03). Presence of CMV was associated with up-regulated expression of all selected cytokines in the ileum (p\u200a<\u200a0.02) and higher expression of IL-8 and IFN-\u03b21 in the colon (P\u200a<\u200a0.05) of HIV-uninfected subjects, but not among HIV-infected. EBV had no effect on cytokine expression or microbiome composition whatsoever.\nThese results illustrate a complex interplay between HIV-infection, intestinal CMV replication and mucosal gut environment, and highlight a possible modulatory effect of CMV on the microbial and immune homeostasis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006920","authors":["Gianella, Sara","Chaillon, Antoine","Mutlu, Ece A.","Engen, Phillip A.","Voigt, Robin M.","Keshavarzian, Ali","Losurdo, John","Chakradeo, Prachi","Lada, Steven M.","Nakazawa, Masato","Landay, Alan L.","Sara Gianella","Antoine Chaillon","Ece A.
