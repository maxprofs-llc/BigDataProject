Lipoprotein oxidation was assessed by conjugated diene formation as measured by changes in absorbance at 234 nm (deltaA234), thiobarbituric-acid-reactive-substance (TBARS) production and trinitrobenzene-sulfonic-acid (TNBS) reactivity.\nRed wine (0.2 mg ethanol\/mL) inhibited LDL oxidation as indicated by an 85.7% decrease in absorbance at 234 nm, a 96.5% decrease in TBARS production and complete prevention of the decrease in TNBS reactivity. White wine and ethanol did not have any significant effect at 0.2 mg\/mL. White wine at 1.0 mg ethanol\/mL inhibited TBARS production from LDL by 84.1%. Red wine (0.2 mg ethanol\/mL) inhibited HDL oxidation as indicated by a 78.9% decrease in deltaA234, an 81.7% decrease in TBARS production and by no change in TNBS reactivity. White wine and ethanol had no effect at 0.2 mg\/mL. White wine at 1.0 mg ethanol\/mL inhibited TBARS production from HDL by 66.4%.\nThese results indicate that red wine inhibits the cell mediated oxidation of lipoproteins, that white wine is not as effective as red wine and that the effect of the red wine is not due to its ethanol content.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e94","authors":["Rifici, V A","Stephan, E M","Schneider, S H","Khachadurian, A K"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-07T02:25:26+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0731-5724"],"issue":"2","journal":"The Journal of the American College of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1505405060,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10204829\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10204829\/"],"pmid":"10204829","pubdate":"1999-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Red wine inhibits the cell-mediated oxidation of LDL and HDL.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/red-wine-inhibits-cellmediated-oxidation-ldl-hdl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.33,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.33},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414430,"mean":7.0825007427048,"rank":610528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7803592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414430,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232149,"mean":12.900510975756,"rank":28639,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":203497,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232149,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1097,"mean":15.52,"rank":213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1097,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":78.966545454545,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
