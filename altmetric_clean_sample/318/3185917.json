Incubation is usually 10 to 14 days but can be up to 18 months depending on the strain of parasite.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbf4","authors":["Croft AM"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T06:43:28+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Clinical Evidence","last_mentioned_on":1439799830,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21418669","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3217660"],"pmid":"21418669","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Malaria: prevention in travellers","type":"article","volume":"2010","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/malaria-prevention-travellers-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":23,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":23},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5493334,"mean":6.3767737652188,"rank":236650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":5255658,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5493334,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192333,"mean":8.6274490880354,"rank":12058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":180234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192333,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":2.89592,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.36,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Mefloquine","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=639728930#altmetric_citation_25","license":"public","citation_ids":[3185917],"posted_on":"2014-12-26T20:46:57+00:00","summary":"Mefloquine (brand names: Lariam, Mephaquin or Mefliam) is an orally administered medication used in the prevention and treatment of malaria.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=186497","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Formerly 98","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Formerly 98"}}],"news":[{"title":"Call for Army to drop malaria drug","url":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-33943282","license":"public","citation_ids":[3855918,3185917],"posted_on":"2015-08-17T05:01:32+00:00","summary":"A call is made for an immediate ban on a controversial anti-malaria drug given to British soldiers.","author":{"name":"BBC News","url":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/102\/normal\/image.png?1369859278"}},{"title":"Antimalarial drug Lariam should not be given to UK troops, Tory MP says","url":"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/uk-news\/2015\/aug\/17\/antimalarial-drug-malaria-lariam-uk-troops-tory-mp-johnny-mercer-mental-health","license":"public","citation_ids":[3185917],"posted_on":"2015-08-17T08:23:50+00:00","summary":"Johnny Mercer calls for ban on once-a-week tablet which has been linked with psychosis, suicidal thoughts, depression and hallucinations A Conservative MP has called for a immediate ban on a controversial antimalarial drug given to British soldiers oversea","author":{"name":"The Guardian","url":"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/103\/normal\/the_guardian.png?1369846972"}}]}}
