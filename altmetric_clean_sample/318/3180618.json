We tried to solve this problem by changing from the conventional fixed-phlebotomist phlebotomy system (CFPPS), in which the phlebotomist waits for patients at a fixed location to the active-phlebotomist phlebotomy system (APPS), in which a phlebotomist goes to patients actively. We compared the productivity of these two systems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f06","authors":["Jeon BR","Seo M","Lee YW","Shin HB","Lee SH","Lee YK"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T03:18:40+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Clinical Laboratory","last_mentioned_on":1332730969,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21391461"],"pmid":"21391461","pubdate":"2011-03-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Improving the blood collection process using the active-phlebotomist phlebotomy system.","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improving-blood-collection-process-using-activephlebotomist-phlebotomy-system"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3925100,"mean":5.0193485500126,"rank":898833,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2489557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3925100,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121168,"mean":8.9898970469291,"rank":36139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":83452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121168,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127,"mean":1.4004761904762,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.2269230769231,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
