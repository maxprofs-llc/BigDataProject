The results of the epidemiological, environmental and microbiological investigations allowed the rapid identification of a public whirlpool spa as the most probable source of contamination and the implementation of appropriate control measures. This investigation has stressed the need for good cooperation between partners and the importance of the molecular analysis of Legionella strains.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000738e","authors":["Campese C","Roche D","Cl\u00e9ment C","Fierobe F","Jarraud S","de Waelle P","Perrin H","Che D"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T07:41:15+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"26","journal":"Eurosurveillance","last_mentioned_on":1398999046,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20619131"],"pmid":"20619131","pubdate":"2010-07-13T23:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Cluster of Legionnaires' disease associated with a public whirlpool spa, France, April-May 2010.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cluster-legionnaires-disease-associated-public-whirlpool-spa-france-aprilmay-2010"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3712057,"mean":4.9755845515295,"rank":842720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2345263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3712057,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107252,"mean":8.724739070032,"rank":30633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":75390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107252,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":388,"mean":4.3542015503876,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":388,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":4.3461818181818,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
