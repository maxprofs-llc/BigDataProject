However, owing to intense conservation actions and the ban of DDT and other persistent pollutants, populations are currently recovering. We show that despite passing through demographic bottlenecks, white-tailed eagle populations have retained significant levels of genetic diversity. Both genetic and ringing data indicate that migration between populations has not been a major factor for the maintenance of genetic variability. We argue that the long generation time of eagles has acted as an intrinsic buffer against loss of genetic diversity, leading to a shorter effective time of the experienced bottleneck. Notably, conservation actions taken in several small sub-populations have ensured the preservation of a larger proportion of the total genetic diversity than if conservation had focused on the population stronghold in Norway. For conservation programmes targeting other endangered, long-lived species, our results highlight the possibility for local retention of high genetic diversity in isolated remnant populations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c6d","authors":["Frank Hailer","Bj\u00f6rn Helander","Alv O Folkestad","Sergei A Ganusevich","Steinar Garstad","Peter Hauff","Christian Koren","Torgeir Nyg\u00e5rd","Veljo Volke","Carles Vil\u00e0","Hans Ellegren"],"doi":"10.1098\/rsbl.2006.0453","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T08:39:08+00:00","issns":["1744-957X","1744-9561"],"issue":"2","journal":"Biology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1306736297,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1098\/rsbl.2006.0453","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1618921"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/roybiolett\/2\/2\/316.full.pdf","pmid":"17148392","pubdate":"2006-06-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"316","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Bottlenecked but long-lived: high genetic diversity retained in white-tailed eagles upon recovery from population decline","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bottlenecked-longlived-high-genetic-diversity-retained-whitetailed-eagles-upon-recovery-population-d"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8401161,"mean":7.0723745282717,"rank":2156231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5097061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8401161,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243222,"mean":8.2711718724946,"rank":69818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":167412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243222,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2000,"mean":34.94220110055,"rank":1444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2000,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":55.136,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":25,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
