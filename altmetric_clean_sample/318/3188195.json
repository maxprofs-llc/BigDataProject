A molecular weight of 4.6 x 10(6) was calculated from the sedimentation coefficient, S degrees (20,w) = 86.2S, the diffusion coefficient, D(20,w) = 1.55 x 10(-7) cm(2)\/sec., and an assumed partial specific volume, [UNK] = 0.708 ml\/gm. The virus has a ribonucleic acid content of 1.0 x 10(6) atomic mass units. Electrophoresis experiments showed that the virus is stable in 0.10 ionic strength buffers in the pH range 3-6. Breakdown of the virus was observed outside this pH range. Some characteristics of the breakdown products are described.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1962BpJ.....2....1B","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c89","authors":["Bockstahler, L E","Kaesberg, P","Larry E.
