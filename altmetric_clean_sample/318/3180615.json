The objective of this study was to estimate and compare the caecal microbial activity in hares and rabbits via an analysis of the following end-products of in vitro caecal fermentation: methane, total gas production, short chain fatty acids and ammonia concentration. Hare caecal methanogenesis occurred at a much lower level (0.25 mmol\/kg for samples incubated without substrate and 0.22 mmol\/kg for samples incubated with substrate) than that of the rabbit (15.49 and 11.73 mmol\/kg, respectively) (P<0.001). The impact of the substrate's presence on caecal methanogenesis was not significant, though its presence increased the total gas production during fermentation (P<0.001). Hare caecal microflora produced a lower short chain fatty acids concentration than did rabbit microorganisms (P<0.05). In unincubated hare samples, the short chain fatty acids concentration was 28.4 mmol\/kg, whereas in unincubated rabbit samples, the short chain fatty acids concentration was 51.8 mmol\/kg. The caecal fermentation pattern of the hare was characterised by higher propionate and isobutyrate molar proportions compared with those observed in rabbit caecum (P<0.01). No significant changes in the ammonia concentration in either rabbit or hare caecum were found. The results obtained indicate some differences in the activity of the microbial populations colonising the hare and rabbit caecum, particularly in regards to methanogenic Archaea.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Dorota Mi\u015bta","Bo\u017cena Kr\u00f3liczewska","Milan Marounek","Ewa Pecka","Wojciech Zawadzki","J\u00f3zef Nicpo\u0144"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0117117","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T03:18:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1422907195,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25629411?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25629411"],"pmid":"25629411","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"In Vitro Study and Comparison of Caecal Methanogenesis and Fermentation Pattern in the Brown Hare (Lepus europaeus) and Domestic Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus).","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitro-study-comparison-caecal-methanogenesis-fermentation-pattern-brown-hare-lepus-europaeus-domesti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6588517,"mean":6.113364640232,"rank":3134195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1966961,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6588517,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208247,"mean":8.4646826733769,"rank":108074,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":75878,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208247,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100107,"mean":9.8522914910196,"rank":57633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":31768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100107,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2222,"mean":11.850320576317,"rank":1298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":738,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2222,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
