First, a short definition of the torsion angles is given, followed by a concise yet critical overview of the commonly applied experimental techniques. Finally, the possible role of metals upon the following conformational changes of oligonucleotides is discussed: (i) the denaturation of double-strands, (ii) the transition from B- to A-DNA, (iii) the transition from right- to left-handed DNA and RNA, (iv) the condensation, (v) and other conformational changes. We conclude with a summary and outlook.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cca9","authors":["Bernhard Spingler"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-94-007-2172-2_3","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T08:34:17+00:00","issns":["1559-0836"],"journal":"Metal ions in life sciences","last_mentioned_on":1331283697,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/978-94-007-2172-2_3"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2F978-94-007-2172-2_3.pdf","pmid":"22210336","pubdate":"2016-02-13T20:12:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Metal Ion-Promoted Conformational Changes of Oligonucleotides","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metal-ionpromoted-conformational-changes-oligonucleotides"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Oligonucleotide","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=480972097#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3187851],"posted_on":"2012-03-09T09:01:37+00:00","summary":"Oligonucleotides are short, single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules that have a wide range of applications in genetic testing, research, and forensics.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=200464","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Petergans","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Petergans"}}]}}
