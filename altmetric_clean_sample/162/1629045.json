Voxel-based morphometry analysis of gray matter (GM) volumes, surface-based analysis of cortical thickness, and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics analysis of white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) based on MRI images were conducted on 16 adults (20-22 years) who immigrated to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (2300-4400 m) for 2 years. They had no chronic mountain sickness. Control group consisted of 16 matched sea level subjects. A battery of neuropsychological tests was also conducted. HA immigrants showed significantly decreased GM volumes in the right postcentral gyrus and right superior frontal gyrus, and increased GM volumes in the right middle frontal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, right inferior and middle temporal gyri, bilateral inferior ventral pons, and right cerebellum crus1. While there was some divergence in the left hemisphere, surface-based patterns of GM changes in the right hemisphere resembled those seen for VBM analysis. FA changes were observed in multiple WM tracts. HA immigrants showed significant impairment in pulmonary function, increase in reaction time, and deficit in mental rotation. Parahippocampal and middle frontal GM volumes correlated with vital capacity. Superior frontal GM volume correlated with mental rotation and postcentral GM correlated with reaction time. Paracentral lobule and frontal FA correlated with mental rotation reaction time. There might be structural modifications occurred in the adult immigrants during adaptation to HA. The changes in GM may be related to impaired respiratory function and psychological deficits.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Jiaxing Zhang","Haiyan Zhang","Jinqiang Li","Ji Chen","Qiaoqing Han","Jianzhong Lin","Tianhe Yang","Ming Fan"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0068621","first_seen_on":"2013-07-16T23:00:40+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1377413088,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0068621"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0068621.pdf","pmid":"23874692","pubdate":"2013-07-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e68621","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Adaptive Modulation of Adult Brain Gray and White Matter to High Altitude: Structural MRI Studies","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adaptive-modulation-adult-brain-gray-white-matter-high-altitude-structural-mri-studies-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228993,"mean":5.9654070340771,"rank":4381159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1622553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228993,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99101,"mean":7.6967217558023,"rank":62831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":32123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99101,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98168,"mean":9.7590730082411,"rank":67036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":26532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98168,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3649,"mean":13.008282346491,"rank":2428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3649,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
