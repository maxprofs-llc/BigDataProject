The Rhetoric of Heterosexual Victimhood in the WHO 2008 HIV\/AIDS Controversy"],"citation":{"abstract":"This article examines the 2008 World Health Organization\/Joint United Nations Program on HIV\/AIDS controversy through original reports and media coverage. Analysis reveals that discourse rhetorically exonerates heterosexuals from HIV\/AIDS while reifying homophobic and morally righteous ideology about HIV\/AIDS and homosexuality. Discourses of \"fraudulent science,\" \"heterosexual absence,\" and reverse victimization destabilize meaning of HIV\/AIDS and heterosexuality. \"AIDS,\" \"heterosexuality,\" and even victimhood and minority status were destabilized and resignified in a rhetoric that benefited from its status as science even as it rendered past science suspect as ideological.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f6100013cc","doi":"10.1080\/00918369.2013.784109","first_seen_on":"2013-07-13T10:11:12+00:00","issns":["1540-3602"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Homosexuality","last_mentioned_on":1373717467,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23844883?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23844883","pubdate":"2013-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Routledge","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"Destabilizing Science From the Right: The Rhetoric of Heterosexual Victimhood in the World Health Organization's 2008 HIV\/AIDS Controversy.","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/destabilizing-science-right-rhetoric-heterosexual-victimhood-world-health-organizations-2008-hivaids"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":2164198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2868756,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93557,"mean":7.5971919492071,"rank":35273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":58196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93557,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":516,"mean":4.3421126213592,"rank":290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":516,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":3.7375,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
