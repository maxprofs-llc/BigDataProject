The cardiac patch consists of a scaffold seeded with stem cells. To identify the best scaffold for cardiac patch construction we compared polyurethane, Collagen Cell Carriers, ePTFE, and ePTFE SSP1-RGD regarding their receptiveness to seeding with mesenchymal stem cells isolated from umbilical cord tissue. Seeding was tested at an array of cell seeding densities. The bioartificial patches were cultured for up to 35 days and evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, microscopy of histological stains, fluorescence microscopy, and mitochondrial assays. Polyurethane was the only biomaterial which resulted in an organized multilayer (seeding density: 0.750 \u00d7 10(6) cells\/cm(2)). Cultured over 35 days at this seeding density the mitochondrial activity of the cells on polyurethane patches continually increased. There was no decrease in the E Modulus of polyurethane once seeded with cells. Seeding of CCC could only be realized at a low seeding density and both ePTFE and ePTFE SSP1-RGD were found to be unreceptive to seeding. Of the tested scaffolds polyurethane thus crystallized as the most appropriate for seeding with mesenchymal stem cells in the framework of myocardial tissue engineering.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5723cf058f610004c71","authors":["Herrmann FE","Lehner A","Hollweck T","Haas U","Fano C","Fehrenbach D","Kozlik-Feldmann R","Wintermantel E","Eissner G","Hagl C","Akra B","Herrmann, Florian E.
