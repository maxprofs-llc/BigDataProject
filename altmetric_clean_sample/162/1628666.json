Its flowering period of two days is divided into a female flowering phase in the first night and a male flowering phase in the second night. Recently, we have documented thermogenesis in the spadix of the Titan arum during the female flowering phase. Here, we document a second thermogenic phase in which the male florets are heated during the male flowering phase. Obviously the two nocturnal thermogenic phases are linked with the two flowering periods. These observations now allow a more detailed understanding of the flowering behavior of the Titan arum.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008547","authors":["Korotkova N","Barthlott W","Nadja Korotkova","Wilhelm Barthlott"],"first_seen_on":"2013-07-16T18:55:06+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"11","journal":"Plant Signaling & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1487277454,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19838070","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2819525\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2819525"],"pmid":"19838070","pubdate":"2009-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Horticultural Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"1096","subjects":["botany"],"title":"On the thermogenesis of the Titan arum (Amorphophallus titanum)","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thermogenesis-titan-arum-amorphophallus-titanum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.2,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":1332801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6882138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125933,"mean":7.1233484737796,"rank":21215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":104652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125933,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":746,"mean":1.7972724832215,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":746,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.3463076923077,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
