Demonstration that these measurements can be carried out on a retrofitted mass spectrometer with a different type of ion source is important to the growing community of geoscientists considering employing this technique.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f6100086ec","authors":["Rosenheim, Brad E.","Tang, Jianwu","Fernandez, Alvaro"],"doi":"10.1002\/rcm.6634","endpage":"1857","first_seen_on":"2013-07-16T14:23:38+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1097-0231","0951-4198"],"issue":"16","journal":"Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry","last_mentioned_on":1374039784,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/rcm.6634\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/rcm.6634\/abstract;jsessionid=65CD9B18D5366CEFBB82A35A7EAEB267.d04t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/rcm.6634\/pdf","pmid":"23857930","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Earth Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1847","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Measurement of multiply substituted isotopologues ('clumped isotopes') of CO2 using a 5kV compact isotope ratio mass spectrometer: Performance, reference frame, and carbonate paleothermometry","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measurement-multiply-substituted-isotopologues-clumped-isotopes-co2-using-5-kv-compact-isotope-ratio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6688927,"mean":6.155306532915,"rank":2692701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":3929037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6688927,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119521,"mean":6.7744100903616,"rank":42172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":75797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119521,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1495,"mean":1.433484605087,"rank":282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":1198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1495,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.45,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
