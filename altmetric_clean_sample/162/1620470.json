This delicate organization is the consequence of unique molecular identity of each cell gradually established by precise spatiotemporal gene expression control during development. Currently, studies on the molecular-structural association are beginning to reveal how the spatiotemporal gene expression patterns are related to cellular differentiation and structural development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","authors":["Shuiwang Ji"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2105-14-222","first_seen_on":"2013-07-12T08:01:30+00:00","issns":["1471-2105"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1501449254,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2105\/14\/222\/abstract","https:\/\/bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2105-14-222"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2105-14-222.pdf","pmid":"23845024","pubdate":"2013-07-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"222","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Computational genetic neuroanatomy of the developing mouse brain: dimensionality reduction, visualization, and clustering","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/computational-genetic-neuroanatomy-developing-mouse-brain-dimensionality-reduction-visualization-clu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.85,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296422,"mean":6.9913019303065,"rank":1690652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6596011,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296422,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126211,"mean":7.0660858093655,"rank":25348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":100683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126211,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3623,"mean":5.0151662065157,"rank":1022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":2593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3623,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":5.8648888888889,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
