To help elucidate this process, we propose in the Scribbling Pad hypothesis that bacteria have been constantly using plasmids for genetic experimentation and, in particular, for the construction of operons. This hypothesis simultaneously solves the problems of the creation of operons and the way operons are propagated. We cite results in the literature to support the hypothesis and make experimental predictions to test it.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003468","authors":["Norris V","Merieau A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.resmic.2013.04.003","first_seen_on":"2013-07-17T08:05:52+00:00","issns":["0923-2508","09232508"],"journal":"Research in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1374048347,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0923250813000697"],"pmid":"23587635","pubdate":"2013-04-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Masson SAS","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Plasmids as scribbling pads for operon formation and propagation ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plasmids-scribbling-pads-operon-formation-propagation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3070451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":947300,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81022,"mean":7.9474993643625,"rank":55627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":15530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81022,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265,"mean":2.3440075757576,"rank":181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
