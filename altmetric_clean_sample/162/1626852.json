Progressive structural brain changes in individuals with bipolar disorder have been suggested to be associated with defects in the secretion of neurotrophic factors. We sought to assess how the regulated secretory pathway in the brain is affected in patients with bipolar disorder by measuring chromogranin B and secretogranin II, which are 2 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biological markers for this process.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000cb4","authors":["Jakobsson J","Stridsberg M","Zetterberg H","Blennow K","Ekman CJ","Johansson AG","Sellgren C","Land\u00e9n M"],"doi":"10.1503\/jpn.120170","first_seen_on":"2013-07-16T03:04:28+00:00","issns":["1180-4882"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Psychiatry & Neuroscience : JPN","last_mentioned_on":1387437183,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23415276","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23415276?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1503\/jpn.120170"],"pmid":"23415276","pubdate":"2013-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"Decreased cerebrospinal fluid secretogranin II concentrations in severe forms of bipolar disorder.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/decreased-cerebrospinal-fluid-secretogranin-ii-concentrations-severe-forms-bipolar-disorder"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4724672,"mean":5.6964439640363,"rank":470377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":4248672,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4724672,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90994,"mean":7.7550819733387,"rank":11632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":79241,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90994,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":346,"mean":5.4342956521739,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":346,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":5.18125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
