During periods of ischemia following reperfusion in ischemic stroke, not only loss of energy supply, but a few other factors including mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress also make vital contribution to neuronal injury. Here we synthesized a steroid compound 5\u03b1-androst-3\u03b2,5,6\u03b2-triol by 3 steps starting from dehydroepiandrosterone and examined its effect on mitochondrial function and oxidative stress in primary cultured cortical neurons exposed to hypoxia followed by reoxygenation. 5\u03b1-Androst-3\u03b2,5,6\u03b2-triol dose-dependently protected cortical neurons from hypoxia\/reoxygenation exposure. Rates of reduction in neuronal viability, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, disruption of ATP production and oxidative stress were ameliorated in 5\u03b1-androst-3\u03b2,5,6\u03b2-triol pretreated cultures. In summary, these results suggest that 5\u03b1-androst-3\u03b2,5,6\u03b2-triol is neuroprotective against hypoxia\/reoxygenation induced neuronal injuries through mediation of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035c1","authors":["Chen J","Leng T","Chen W","Yan M","Yin W","Huang Y","Lin S","Duan D","Lin J","Wu G","Zhang J","Yan G"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.steroids.2013.06.004","first_seen_on":"2013-07-16T15:21:19+00:00","issns":["0039-128X","0039128X"],"issue":"10","journal":"Steroids","last_mentioned_on":1373988029,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0039128X13001451"],"pmid":"23811019","pubdate":"2013-07-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"A synthetic steroid 5\u03b1-androst-3\u03b2,5,6\u03b2-triol blocks hypoxia\/reoxygenation-induced neuronal injuries via protection of mitochondrial function ","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthetic-steroid-5%CE%B1androst3%CE%B256triol-blocks-hypoxiareoxygenation-induced-neuronal-injuries-via-prote"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":2899689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":79331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84561,"mean":7.3928752601705,"rank":67190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84561,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":298,"mean":2.4056430976431,"rank":231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":298,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.7,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
