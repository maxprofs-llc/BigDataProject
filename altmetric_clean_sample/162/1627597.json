The reaction of [V10O26](4-) with p-toluenesulfonic acid proceeded under an aerobic environment to give 2 in the presence of an excess amount of bromide anion, which acted as both a template anion and a reducing reagent for the formation of the mixed-valence framework. For the synthesis of cluster 1, additional reductive conditions were required due to the weak reducing ability of the chloride anion. The crystal structures of 1 and 2 were determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Both were found to consist of a discrete [V(V)9V(IV)7O38(X)](4-) framework by the linkage of VO5 pyramidal units. Cyclic voltammetric studies of 1 and 2 in acetonitrile showed a series of stepwise reversible redox processes, which were due to the redox of the spherical polyoxovanadate frameworks. The oxidative bromination reactions of aromatic substrates were also investigated using cluster 2 as a catalyst under aerobic conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Naohiro Kato","Yoshihito Hayashi"],"doi":"10.1039\/c3dt50521a","first_seen_on":"2013-07-16T10:24:20+00:00","issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"33","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1373970258,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/DT\/C3DT50521A"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2013\/dt\/c3dt50521a","pmid":"23857565","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"11804","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Discrete spherical hexadecavanadates incorporating a bromide with oxidative bromination activity","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/discrete-spherical-hexadecavanadates-incorporating-bromide-oxidative-bromination-activity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3560132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89140,"mean":7.5754236641651,"rank":71783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89140,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7988,"mean":0.87506973832478,"rank":4225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7988,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":3.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
