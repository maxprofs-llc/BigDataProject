Historically, rate-dependency studies have compared drug effects on different baseline rates of behavior maintained either by different schedules of reinforcement or during sequential segments of a fixed-interval schedule. The current experiment generated different baseline rates of behavior by altering frequency of electrical stimulation in an intracranial self-stimulation assay. Amphetamine and 10 other monoamine releasers were analyzed for their ability to produce rate-dependent effects in this assay. There were three main findings. First, all compounds produced rate-dependent effects at some dose. Second, one parameter of rate-dependency plots (peak Y-intercept of the regression line) correlated with in-vitro neurochemical data on selectivity of these compounds to release dopamine versus serotonin (P<0.025, R=0.50). Lastly, a correlation between peak Y-intercept and breakpoints under a progressive-ratio procedure in nonhuman primates was also significant (P<0.05, R=0.64). Overall, these results extend the rate-dependent effects of monoamine releasers to behavior maintained under intracranial self-stimulation and suggest that, at least for monoamine releasers, the Y-intercept parameter of rate-dependency plots might be a useful metric of drug reward and predictor of drug self-administration measures of drug reinforcement.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c00","doi":"10.1097\/fbp.0b013e328363d1a4","first_seen_on":"2013-07-13T04:07:40+00:00","issns":["0955-8810"],"issue":"","journal":"Behavioural Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1373688451,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/behaviouralpharm\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Rate_dependent_effects_of_monoamine_releasers_on.99666.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/behaviouralpharm\/9000\/00000\/Rate_dependent_effects_of_monoamine_releasers_on.99666.pdf","pmid":"23851484","pubdate":"2013-07-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"","subjects":["behavioralsciences","pharmacology"],"title":"Rate-dependent effects of monoamine releasers on intracranial self-stimulation in rats: implications for abuse liability assessment","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ratedependent-effects-monoamine-releasers-intracranial-selfstimulation-rats-implications-abuse-liabi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3070619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":947453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89115,"mean":7.4824825055548,"rank":60653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":17301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89115,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":570,"mean":1.8856028119508,"rank":263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":570,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":0.98693333333333,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
