For telencephalic and diencephalic injections, the brain surface, the interhemispheric groove and the straight sinus can be used as absolute zero points for dorso-ventral, medio-lateral and rostro-caudal coordinates, respectively. In case of brainstem targets, the surface of the rhomboid fossa, the posterior spinal artery and the obex could serve as reference points along the above-mentioned coordinates. The application of high-precision stereotaxic measurements based on intracranial landmarks and sophisticated surgical procedures can yield well-targeted, small and well circumscribed injection sites that make possible the mapping of discrete nuclear subdivisions or delicate nuclei in the brain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000288f","authors":["Kov\u00e1cs, Zsolt I","Palkovits, Mikl\u00f3s"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00221-010-2459-0","first_seen_on":"2013-07-12T09:57:12+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1432-1106"],"issue":"1","journal":"Experimental Brain Research","last_mentioned_on":1373632111,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20978749"],"pmid":"20978749","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Intracranial landmarks and other techniques to further improve the precision of stereotaxic tracer injections.","type":"article","volume":"208","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intracranial-landmarks-other-techniques-further-improve-precision-stereotaxic-tracer-injections"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1689261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":2793916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89328,"mean":7.4942667054756,"rank":29061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":59570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89328,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1217,"mean":2.8019424342105,"rank":413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1217,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":7.2455384615385,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
