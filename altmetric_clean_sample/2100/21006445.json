The Optimal Screening for Prediction of Referral and Outcome (OSPRO) cohort studies were designed to develop and validate standard assessment tools for review of systems and yellow flags. This cohort profile paper provides a description of and future plans for the validation cohort.\nPatients (n=440) with primary complaint of spine, shoulder or knee pain were recruited into the OSPRO validation cohort via a national Orthopaedic Physical Therapy-Investigative Network. Patients were followed up at 4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months for pain, functional status and quality of life outcomes. Healthcare utilisation outcomes were also collected at 6 and 12 months.\nThere are no longitudinal findings reported to date from the ongoing OSPRO validation cohort. The previously completed cross-sectional OSPRO development cohort yielded two assessment tools that were investigated in the validation cohort.\nFollow-up data collection was completed in January 2017. Primary analyses will investigate how accurately the OSPRO review of systems and yellow flag tools predict 12-month pain, functional status, quality of life and healthcare utilisation outcomes. Planned secondary analyses include prediction of pain interference and\/or development of chronic pain, investigation of treatment expectation on patient outcomes and analysis of patient satisfaction following an episode of physical therapy.\nThe OSPRO validation cohort was not registered.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Steven Z George","Jason M Beneciuk","Trevor A Lentz","Samuel S Wu"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-015188","first_seen_on":"2017-06-12T21:00:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"6","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1501860696,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/7\/6\/e015188","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/7\/6\/e015188.full?ijkey=IPUcVHQzvUZmj6Z&keytype=ref"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/bmjopen\/7\/6\/e015188.full.pdf","pmid":"28600371","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","startpage":"e015188","title":"The Optimal Screening for Prediction of Referral and Outcome (OSPRO) in patients with musculoskeletal pain conditions: a longitudinal validation cohort from the USA","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optimal-screening-prediction-referral-outcome-ospro-patients-musculoskeletal-pain-conditions-longitu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.5,"score_history":{"1y":5.5,"6m":5.5,"3m":5.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":1513940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6799352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240130,"mean":12.263021867413,"rank":57683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":182278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240130,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6145,"mean":17.033153320313,"rank":2416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3722,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6145,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":530,"mean":14.942529300567,"rank":193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":530,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
