Medulloblastoma is an embryonal tumor, of which little is known about the pathogenesis. Several efforts have been made to understand the molecular aspects of its tumorigenic pathways; however, these are poorly understood. microRNA (miRNA), a type of non\u2011coding short RNA, has been proven to be associated with a number of physiological processes and pathological processes of serious diseases, including brain tumors. Differentially expressed miRNAs serve an important role in numerous types of malignancy. The present study aims to define a differentially expressed set of miRNAs in medulloblastoma tumor tissue, compared with normal samples, to improve the understanding of the tumorigenesis. It was identified that 22 miRNAs were upregulated and 26\u00a0miRNAs were downregulated in the tumor tissue compared with the normal group. However, when the medulloblastoma tissue was compared with normal cerebellum tissue, 9\u00a0miRNAs were identified to be up or downregulated in the tumor samples. The differentially expressed miRNAs in the tumor tissue were identified in order to clarify the networks and pathways of tumorigenesis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Subsequently, key regulatory genes associated with the development of medulloblastoma were identified, including tumor protein p53, insulin like growth factor\u00a01 receptor, argonaute 2, mitogen\u2011activated protein kinases 1 and\u00a03, sirtuin\u00a01 and Y box binding protein 1.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Junqiang Dai","Qiao Li","Zhitong Bing","Yinian Zhang","Liang Niu","Hang Yin","Guoqiang Yuan","Yawen Pan"],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2017.6490","first_seen_on":"2017-04-26T13:06:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-2997","1791-3004"],"journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1493238967,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28440450?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28440450","pubdate":"2017-04-26T22:03:18+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Comprehensive analysis of a microRNA expression profile in pediatric medulloblastoma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comprehensive-analysis-microrna-expression-profile-pediatric-medulloblastoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083342,"mean":6.8946797770799,"rank":3786241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4116618,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083342,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233903,"mean":12.663447649015,"rank":109083,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":117776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233903,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2068,"mean":1.612908563135,"rank":227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":1807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2068,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":0.67801418439716,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
