Different \u03b2-lactamase genes were identified by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Bacterial strain typing was performed by enzymatic macrorestriction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing as well as multilocus sequence typing for selected isolates. The majority of Acinetobacter baumannii (46\/50) and one Acinetobacter pittii isolate harbored carbapenemase genes blaOXA-23 or blaOXA-72; two A. baumannii contained both genes. PFGE typing of all A. baumannii showed the presence of nine different clones belonging to eight sequence types ST350, ST208, ST436, ST437, ST449, ST231, ST502, and ST579. Molecular characterization of the remaining isolates confirmed the presence of one NDM-1-producing E. coli-ST101 clone (five isolates) and one P. mirabilis clone (13 isolates) with VIM-1 and CMY-99. Furthermore, NDM-1 was identified in P. rettgeri and M. morganii and VIM-2 in the P. aeruginosa isolate. The permanent introduction of OXA-23\/72 carbapenemase-producing A. baumannii clones into the hospital and the repeated occurrence of one VIM-1-producing P. mirabilis and one NDM-1-producing E. coli-ST101 clone over a period of more than 1 year is of concern and requires intensified investigations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5043cf058f6100030c2","authors":["Pfeifer, Yvonne","Trifonova, Angelina","Pietsch, Michael","Brunner, Magdalena","Todorova, Iva","Gergova, Ivanka","Wilharm, Gottfried","Werner, Guido","Savov, Encho"],"doi":"10.1089\/mdr.2016.0059","first_seen_on":"2016-07-28T16:17:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1931-8448","1076-6294"],"journal":"Microbial Drug Resistance: Mechanism, Epidemiology, & Disease","last_mentioned_on":1469772656,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27459019?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27459019","pubdate":"2016-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Clonal Transmission of Gram-Negative Bacteria with Carbapenemases NDM-1, VIM-1, and OXA-23\/72 in a Bulgarian Hospital","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clonal-transmission-gramnegative-bacteria-carbapenemases-ndm1-vim1-oxa2372-bulgarian-hospital"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154593,"mean":6.8923629076653,"rank":4094448,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3853177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154593,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257950,"mean":11.979463599393,"rank":130103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":117441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257950,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":395,"mean":2.0953705583756,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":395,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":1.1297368421053,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
