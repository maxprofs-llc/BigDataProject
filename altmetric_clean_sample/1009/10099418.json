There are no available data on disease-specific pediatric patient-reported outcomes.\nOur objective was to create developmentally-appropriate, health-related quality of life questionnaires (QOL-PCD) for children (6-12 years) and adolescents (13-17 years) with PCD and a parent proxy measure.\nQOL-PCD was developed using a cross-cultural protocol-driven approach satisfying both North American and European drug regulatory agency guidelines. A conceptual framework was generated by literature review, focus groups (expert clinicians and patients\/parents) and open-ended interviews with children, adolescents and parents of PCD patients. We recruited participants from international research consortiums, PCD clinics and patient advocacy groups, aiming for representation of a wide spectrum of disease severity, sociodemographic status and ethnicity. Qualitative interviews were conducted by trained and experienced research assistants and psychologists. Transcripts were content-analyzed with Atlas.ti\/Nvivo to assess saturation of content. A self-completed item relevance survey was administered to European Union participants. Qualitative and quantitative data were used to construct draft instruments. Questionnaires were further refined following cognitive interviews.\nFocus groups (n=62 experts; n=20 patients\/parents) and open-ended interviews with patients\/parents (n=69; 34 males; age of diagnosis 0-15 years; forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 58-118% predicted) revealed a wide spectrum of issues unique to this population. Content analysis of transcripts identified the following domains, depending on age: Respiratory Symptoms, Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Treatment Burden, Ears & Hearing, Sinus Symptoms, Social Functioning, Role Functioning, Vitality, Health Perceptions, School Functioning, and Eating & Weight. Different items were retained in questionnaires based on age and role of respondent: 37, 43 and 41 items for children, adolescents, and parent proxy respectively. The item relevance survey (n=57) yielded similar results to open-ended interviews. Cognitive testing (n=47; 20 males; age of diagnosis 0-11 years; FEV 49-124% predicted) confirmed that items and response choices were clear, understood by respondents and that all relevant items were included.\nQOL-PCD measures developed using rigorous, protocol-driven methods and international collaborations have demonstrated content validity and cross-cultural equivalence for implementation in English-speaking populations. Psychometric testing is underway to determine their measurement properties for evaluating clinical interventions and informing quality of care.","altmetric_jid":"56f0022b2a83ee4d548b4567","authors":["Dr. Sharon D Dell","Dell, Sharon D","Leigh, Margaret W","Lucas, Jane S","Ferkol, Thomas W","Knowles, Michael R","Alpern, Adrianne","Behan, Laura","Morris, Anjana M","Hogg, Claire","DunnGalvin, Audrey","Quittner, Alexandra L","Sharon D.
