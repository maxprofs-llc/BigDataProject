However, recently exon 19 deletion mutation (del19) of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) clearly shows better clinical benefit over single-point substitution mutation L858R in exon 21 (L858R). The aim of this study was to investigate the difference by analyzing the expression of plasma microRNAs (miRNAs) of NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation del19 or L858R. MiRNA microarray of plasma from patients' blood identified 79 mapped, network-eligible miRNAs (fold > 5), of which 76 were up regulated and 3 were down regulated. Genetic network was performed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Among analysis, MYC, Argonaute2 (AGO2), Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1), cyclin E1 (CCNE1) were involved in organismal abnormalities and cancer. Our findings provide information on the epigenetic signature of the two major sensitive mutations among NSCLC and add to the understanding of mechanisms underlying the different outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Ma, Yihan","Xu, Peiqi","Mi, Yanjun","Wang, Wenyi","Pan, Xiaoyan","Wu, Xiaoting","He, Qi","Liu, Hongming","Tang, Weiwei","An, Hanxiang"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.10829","first_seen_on":"2016-07-28T10:59:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1470154157,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27463019?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27463019"],"pmid":"27463019","pubdate":"2014-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Plasma MiRNA alterations between NSCLC patients harboring Del19 and L858R EGFR mutations","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plasma-mirna-alterations-between-nsclc-patients-harboring-del19-l858r-egfr-mutations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155605,"mean":6.9067370031636,"rank":6194011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1096757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155605,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258047,"mean":11.982879525356,"rank":182660,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":40392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258047,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8656,"mean":3.1218079722704,"rank":4278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":2715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8656,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129,"mean":6.01678125,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
