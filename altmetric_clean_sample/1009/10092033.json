The Family Atherosclerosis Monitoring In earLY life Study is a general, population-based Canadian birth cohort that prospectively evaluated prenatal and early-life traits and their association with atopy and\/or allergic disease. The study population included 901 babies, 857 mothers and 530 fathers. Prenatal and postnatal risk factors were evaluated through questionnaires collected during the antenatal period and at 1 year. The end points of atopy and allergic diseases in infants were evaluated through questionnaires and skin prick testing. Key outcomes included atopy (24.5%), food allergy (17.5%), cow's milk allergy (4.8%), wheezing (18.6%) and eczema (16%). The association between infant antibiotic exposure [odds ratio (OR): 2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.45-2.88] and increased atopy was noted in the multivariate analysis, whereas prenatal maternal exposure to dogs (OR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.42-0.84) and acetaminophen (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.51-0.92) was associated with decreased atopy. This population-based birth cohort in Canada demonstrated high rates of atopy, food allergy, wheezing and eczema. Several previously reported and some novel prenatal and postnatal exposures were associated with atopy and allergic diseases at 1 year of age.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c39","authors":["Batool, T","Reece, P L","Schulze, K M","Morrison, K M","Atkinson, S A","Anand, S S","Teo, K K","Denburg, J A","Cyr, M M",", "],"doi":"10.1017\/s2040174416000386","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2016-07-28T12:12:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2040-1752","2040-1744"],"journal":"Journal of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease","last_mentioned_on":1469707935,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27453525\/"],"pmid":"27453525","pubdate":"2016-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1","title":"Prenatal and early-life predictors of atopy and allergic disease in Canadian children: results of the Family Atherosclerosis Monitoring In earLY life (FAMILY) Study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prenatal-earlylife-predictors-atopy-allergic-disease-canadian-children-results-family-atherosclerosi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8148366,"mean":6.8920487793494,"rank":6193571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1092126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8148366,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257952,"mean":11.978796267508,"rank":182791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":39865,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257952,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188,"mean":3.6157326203209,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.0384615384615,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
