Different plant structures (flowers, vegetative flush, and different sized fruit) of avocado, lime, and papaya crops and green bean pods (a known suitable host) were evaluated for their suitability as hosts for A. l. lutescens Neonate to imago survivorship, the time taken to complete neonate to imago development, preovipositional period, and fecundity were assessed for each crop. Of all the different phenological stages of the plants investigated, A. l. lutescens could complete development to imago on vegetative flush of papaya and lime, papaya flowers, and green bean pods but on no other structures tested. There was higher survivorship to the second instar when neonates fed on green bean pods or flowers or vegetative flush of avocado, lime, or papaya crops than when neonates fed on small, medium, or large fruit of these crops. Insects that developed to the imago on green bean pods were significantly heavier than insects that developed on papaya flowers or papaya vegetative flush. The mean preoviposition period was shorter, and adult females more fecund, if they completed immature development and then fed as adults on papaya vegetative flush or green beans rather than papaya flowers. The data indicate that avocado is not a suitable host for A. l. lutescens, suggesting that adult populations that cause significant pest damage to the fruit of this crop originate elsewhere.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006631","authors":["Lindsay, K R","Furlong, M J"],"doi":"10.1093\/jee\/tow151","first_seen_on":"2016-06-28T12:46:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1938-291X","0022-0493"],"journal":"Journal of Economic Entomology","last_mentioned_on":1467117948,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27346632?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27346632","pubdate":"2016-06-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ecological Applications","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"tow151","title":"\n              Development, Survival, and Fecundity of\n              Amblypelta lutescens lutescens\n              (Hemiptera: Coreidae) on Distinct Phenological Stages of Different Fruit-Crop Host Plants\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-survival-fecundity-amblypelta-lutescens-lutescens-hemiptera-coreidae-distinct-phenologic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7958342,"mean":6.7226589717569,"rank":6887529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7958342,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261193,"mean":11.542767879567,"rank":219215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261193,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1310,"mean":4.9321359816654,"rank":1119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1310,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":3.0667619047619,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ScienceyBot\/statuses\/747772991711305729","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9095582],"posted_on":"2016-06-28T12:45:48+00:00","author":{"name":"Sciencey Things","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/703346006117720064\/30HyYboT_normal.jpg","description":"Bot that uploads PubMed papers on themes: #parallelevolution, #transcriptomics, #Drosophila, #evodevo,  #sexualselection, and cryptic female choice","id_on_source":"ScienceyBot","tweeter_id":"703255639901003776","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":30},"tweet_id":"747772991711305729"}]}}
