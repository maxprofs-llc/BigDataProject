While a crucial part of this process is diet-induced thermogenesis, the underlying mechanisms have remained unexplained. In this issue of Cell Metabolism, Kazak et\u00a0al. (2017) describe a new thermogenic pathway in adipocytes that responds to diet overload, involving creatine cycling. These data suggest that this pathway might limit weight gain during overnutrition.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067cf","authors":["Alan R.
