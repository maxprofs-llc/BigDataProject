Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the thermal hysteresis (TH) of ice-binding collagen peptides was closely related to their concentration and crystal fraction. Collagen hydrolysates with maximal TH were obtained by hydrolysis at pH 8.0, DH 15.0%, and 5% alkaline protease at 55\u00b0C. After purification by column chromatography, the AP-3 ice-binding collagen peptide (GLLGPLGPRGLL) with 1162.8Da molecular weights exhibited the highest TH (5.28\u00b0C), which can be classified as \"hyperactive\". Recrystallisation and melt-resistance of ice cream were improved by AP-3 ice-binding collagen peptide at 0.2% (w\/v) in a similar manner to natural antifreeze proteins. Moreover, the addition of AP-3 collagen peptides in ice cream greatly elevated the glass transition temperature (Tg) to -17.64\u00b0C.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f5","authors":["Hui Cao","Ying Zhao","Yu Bing Zhu","Fei Xu","Jing Song Yu","Min Yuan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.foodchem.2015.08.102","first_seen_on":"2017-08-28T10:54:57+00:00","issns":["03088146"],"journal":"Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1503917683,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26471678"],"pmid":"26471678","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Antifreeze and cryoprotective activities of ice-binding collagen peptides from pig skin","type":"article","volume":"194","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antifreeze-cryoprotective-activities-icebinding-collagen-peptides-pig-skin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":7293082,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171001,"mean":12.509906643275,"rank":139840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171001,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3527,"mean":3.8523981849121,"rank":2610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3527,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141,"mean":2.5381857142857,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
