From 7\/2008 to 12\/2014, Nordic and Baltic centers treated 1509 consecutive patients 1-45 years with Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL according to the NOPHO ALL2008 without cranial irradiation. 1022 patients were 1-9 years (A), 266 were 10-17 years (B), and 221 were 18-45 years (C). Sixteen patients (three adults) died during induction. All others achieved remission after induction or 1-3 intensive blocks. Subsequently, 45 patients (12 adults) died, 122 patients relapsed (32 adults) with a median time to relapse of 1.6 years, and 13 (no adult) developed a second malignancy. Median follow-up time was 4.6 years. Among the three age groups, older patients more often had higher risk ALL due to T-ALL (32%\/25%\/9%, P<0.001), KMT2A rearrangements (6%\/5%\/3%, P<0.001), and higher day 29 residual leukemia for B-lineage (P<0.001), but not T-ALL (P=0.53). Event-free survival rates (pEFS5y) were 89\u00b11% (A), 80\u00b13% (B), and 74\u00b14% (C) with significant differences only for non-high risk groups. Except for thrombosis, pancreatitis and osteonecrosis, the risk of 19 specified toxicities was not enhanced by age above 10 years. In conclusion, a pediatric-based protocol is tolerable and effective for young adults, despite their increased frequency of higher risk features.Leukemia accepted article preview online, 18 August 2017. doi:10.1038\/leu.2017.265.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fa3cf058f610003008","authors":["N Toft","H Birgens","J Abrahamsson","L Gri\u0161kevi&ccaron;ius","H Hallb\u00f6\u00f6k","M Heyman","T W Klausen","\u00d3G J\u00f3nsson","K Palk","K Pruunsild","P Quist-Paulsen","G Vaitkeviciene","K Vettenranta","A \u00c5sberg","T L Frandsen","H V Marquart","H O Madsen","U Nor\u00e9n-Nystr\u00f6m","K Schmiegelow"],"doi":"10.1038\/leu.2017.265","first_seen_on":"2017-08-28T07:02:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0887-6924","1476-5551"],"journal":"Leukemia (08876924)","last_mentioned_on":1503903598,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/leu\/journal\/vaop\/naam\/abs\/leu2017265a.html?foxtrotcallback=true"],"pmid":"28819280","pubdate":"2017-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","hematology"],"title":"Results of NOPHO ALL2008 treatment for patients 1\u201345 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/results-nopho-all2008-treatment-patients-145-years-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":7293073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170958,"mean":12.512925390595,"rank":139823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170958,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1894,"mean":5.6813724247227,"rank":1692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1894,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":13.701907692308,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Ph.
