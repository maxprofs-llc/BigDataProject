The scope of life history theory will increase if these predictions apply to a broad range of organisms. Populations of organisms in contrasting habitats may experience different demographic rates. Thus, we compared the demography and life history traits of a lichen species in contrasting habitats.\nWe compared the abundance, growth, mortality, and reproductive strategy (threshold size for reproduction and reproductive allometry) of epiphytic and saxicolous populations of the asexually reproducing lichen Lobarina scrobiculata in two oak forests in central Spain.\nThe growth rates of saxicolous individuals were two times faster than those of epiphytic individuals. Epiphytic specimens exhibited a smaller threshold size for reproduction and a higher reproductive allocation than their saxicolous counterparts. The populations hosted by trees were two times larger than those on rocks (13,788 vs. 6629 individuals, respectively). The mortality rate did not vary between habitats.\nOur results demonstrate that contrasting habitats selected for differences in the demography and life history traits of a lichen species. Consistent with life history theory predictions, in the habitat with slower growth, L. scrobiculata started to reproduce at a smaller size and its reproductive allocation was higher. This study extends the scope of life history theory and improves our understanding of life history patterns and variations in overlooked taxa such as lichens.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ee","authors":["Sonia Merinero","Gregorio Arag\u00f3n","Isabel Mart\u00ednez"],"doi":"10.3732\/ajb.1700017","first_seen_on":"2017-08-01T09:02:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0002-9122","1537-2197"],"journal":"American Journal of Botany","last_mentioned_on":1502436863,"links":["http:\/\/www.amjbot.org\/content\/104\/7\/1099.full.pdf","http:\/\/www.amjbot.org\/content\/104\/7\/1099.abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3732\/ajb.1700017"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.amjbot.org\/content\/104\/7\/1099.full.pdf","pmid":"28754765","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Botanical Society of America","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Intraspecific life history variation in contrasting habitats: Insights from an obligate symbiotic organism","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intraspecific-life-history-variation-contrasting-habitats-insights-obligate-symbiotic-organism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.05,"score_history":{"1y":6.05,"6m":6.05,"3m":6.05,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":1380718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6970096,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195856,"mean":12.585604574813,"rank":43499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":152115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195856,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2211,"mean":5.1523131221719,"rank":385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":1822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2211,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":17.285878787879,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
