It is partially compensated by intensification of glycolytic reactions and involvement of lipids and amino acids in processes of energy creation. These changes on system level (the muscle system) were confirmed by electromyography. It is confirmed showing the decrease in bioelectrical activity and functional reserves of muscle tissue and clinically by signs of chronic fatigue signs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9183cf058f61000d204","first_seen_on":"2011-12-26T13:55:25+00:00","issns":["1019-5297"],"issue":"5-6","journal":"Likars ka sprava","last_mentioned_on":1324907172,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17380863"],"pmid":"17380863","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Bioelectrical activity of muscle tissue and some characteristics of intracellular methabolism in children living in radiation polluted areas].","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bioelectrical-activity-muscle-tissue-some-characteristics-intracellular-methabolism-children-living"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7990611,"mean":6.7370403733829,"rank":6056264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1078108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7990611,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250411,"mean":4.9692956351586,"rank":161638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":43687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250411,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":1.1492771084337,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/yamagrove\/status\/151297763257229312","citation_ids":[507913],"posted_on":"2011-12-26T13:46:12+00:00","author":{"name":"\u3084\u307e\u3050\u308d","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/828648392024743936\/9UxJYt5A_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"yamagrove","tweeter_id":"255759593","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":476},"tweet_id":"151297763257229312"}]}}
