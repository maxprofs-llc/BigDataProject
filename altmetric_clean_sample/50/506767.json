However, RDTs are known to perform less well for Plasmodium vivax. We evaluated the safety of withholding antimalarial drugs from young Papua New Guinean children with negative RDT results in areas with high levels of both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax infections.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255e","authors":["Senn N","Rarau P","Manong D","Salib M","Siba P","Robinson LJ","Reeder J","Rogerson S","Mueller I","Genton B","N.
