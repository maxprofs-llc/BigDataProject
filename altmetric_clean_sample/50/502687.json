However, the impact of text messaging on simulated driving performance is still not fully understood.\nForty participants engaged in both a single task (driving) and a dual task (driving and text messaging) in a high-fidelity driving simulator.\nAnalysis of driving performance revealed that participants in the dual-task condition responded more slowly to the onset of braking lights and showed impairments in forward and lateral control compared with a driving-only condition. Moreover, text-messaging drivers were involved in more crashes than drivers not engaged in text messaging.\nText messaging while driving has a negative impact on simulated driving performance. This negative impact appears to exceed the impact of conversing on a cell phone while driving.\nThe results increase our understanding of driver distraction and have potential implications for public safety and device development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4dd3cf058f610001c0b","authors":["Frank A.
