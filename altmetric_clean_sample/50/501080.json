Biomarkers could in principle be used for the early detection of PD-related neuronal damage, but no validated, inexpensive, and simple biomarkers are available yet. Here we report on the breath-print of presymptomatic PD in rats, using a model with 50% lesion of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra. Exhaled breath was collected from 19 rats (10 lesioned and 9 sham operated) and analyzed using organically functionalized carbon nanotube sensors. Discriminant factor analysis detected statistically significant differences between the study groups and a classification accuracy of 90% was achieved using leave-one-out cross-validation. The sensors' breath-print was supported by determining statistically significant differences of several volatile organic compounds in the breath of the lesioned rats and the sham operated rats, using gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. The observed breath-print shows potential for cost-effective, fast, and reliable early PD detection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006812","authors":["Ulrike Tisch","Yuval Aluf","Radu Ionescu","Morad Nakhle","Rana Bassal","Noa Axelrod","Dorina Robertman","Yael Tessler","John P.
