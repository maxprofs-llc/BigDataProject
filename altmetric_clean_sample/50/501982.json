This extends our previously published work to include three additional biomarkers and three later time points. In comparing with the control, the significant induction of MT and GST genes in livers of the fish exposed to 1 \u03bcg\/l Ag-NPs was observed at various time points during the test period. The Orla C3-1 (Medaka) gene was slightly induced only with 1 \u03bcg\/l Ag-NPs at 7-day exposure while the suppression of p53 and HSP70 was recorded in all exposures at the end of the test. The gene encoding transferrin was repressed at day 21 by both silver types and at every exposure dosage. These results revealed that the Ag-NPs increase metal detoxification, oxidative and inflammatory stress, and finally stimulate immune responses in Medaka. The conspicuous induction of choriogenin L and vitellogenin 1 in male fish exposed to Ag-NPs, especially at 7- and 21-day, compared with the exposures of AgNO(3) or control was the first attempt to examine estrogenic effects of Ag-NPs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f6100065db","doi":"10.1016\/j.ecoenv.2011.11.034","first_seen_on":"2011-12-21T05:52:33+00:00","issns":["1090-2414"],"journal":"Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety","last_mentioned_on":1324446049,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22154143?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22154143","pubdate":"2011-12-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Biomarker gene response in male Medaka (Oryzias latipes) chronically exposed to silver nanoparticle.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biomarker-gene-response-male-medaka-oryzias-latipes-chronically-exposed-silver-nanoparticle-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7539768,"mean":6.5119298514094,"rank":5707199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1008684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7539768,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247748,"mean":4.8480085167532,"rank":158719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":43637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247748,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1242,"mean":2.7479919419823,"rank":675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1242,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":4.7588,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
