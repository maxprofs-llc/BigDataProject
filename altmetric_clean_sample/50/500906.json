Experience, anecdotal reports, and feedback suggested areas for improvement; therefore, QUADAS-2 was developed. This tool comprises 4 domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing. Each domain is assessed in terms of risk of bias, and the first 3 domains are also assessed in terms of concerns regarding applicability. Signalling questions are included to help judge risk of bias. The QUADAS-2 tool is applied in 4 phases: summarize the review question, tailor the tool and produce review-specific guidance, construct a flow diagram for the primary study, and judge bias and applicability. This tool will allow for more transparent rating of bias and applicability of primary diagnostic accuracy studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000227a","authors":["Whiting PF","Rutjes AW","Westwood ME","Mallett S","Deeks JJ","Reitsma JB","Leeflang MM","Sterne JA","Bossuyt PM"],"doi":"10.1059\/0003-4819-155-8-201110180-00009","first_seen_on":"2011-12-20T13:31:10+00:00","funders":["mrc","cruk"],"issns":["1539-3704","0003-4819"],"issue":"8","journal":"Annals of Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1470179109,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22007046?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22007046?dopt=AbstractPlus","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1059\/0003-4819-155-8-201110180-00009"],"pmid":"22007046","pubdate":"2011-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American College of Physicians","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"QUADAS-2: a revised tool for the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies.","type":"article","volume":"155","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quadas2-revised-tool-quality-assessment-diagnostic-accuracy-studies-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155605,"mean":6.9067370031636,"rank":486667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7668696,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155605,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250893,"mean":5.0919312851748,"rank":13157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":237727,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250893,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7940,"mean":26.823283285048,"rank":1652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7940,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":346,"mean":24.798197101449,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":346,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
