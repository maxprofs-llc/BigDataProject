Previous studies have attempted to address the diagnostic yield of finding a genetic cause in ID. The results have varied widely from 10% to 81%, with the highest percentage being found in studies using new array comparative genomic hybridization methodology especially in autism. Although many cases of ID\/NDD result from chromosomal aneuploidy or structural rearrangements, single gene disorders and new categories of genome modification, including epigenetics and copy number variation play an increasingly important role in diagnosis and testing. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and modifications to histone proteins, regulate high-order DNA structure and gene expression. Aberrant epigenetic and copy number variation mechanisms are involved in several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders including Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and microdeletion syndromes. This review will describe a number of the molecular genetic mechanisms that play a role in disorders leading to ID\/NDD and will discuss the categories and technologies for diagnostic testing of these conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6013cf058f61000629a","doi":"10.1097\/dbp.0b013e3181ee384e","first_seen_on":"2011-12-24T13:15:26+00:00","issns":["0196-206X"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1324732004,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jrnldbp\/Abstract\/2010\/09000\/Epigenetics,_Copy_Number_Variation,_and_Other.11.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jrnldbp\/2010\/09000\/Epigenetics,_Copy_Number_Variation,_and_Other.11.pdf","pmid":"20814257","pubdate":"2010-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"582","subjects":["behavioralsciences","pediatrics"],"title":"Epigenetics, Copy Number Variation, and Other Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Neurodevelopmental Disabilities: New Insights and Diagnostic Approaches","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epigenetics-copy-number-variation-other-molecular-mechanisms-underlying-neurodevelopmental-disabilit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3085494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":968829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235015,"mean":4.217393695695,"rank":146810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":50768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235015,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":764,"mean":4.7804587155963,"rank":585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":764,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":2.9613142857143,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
