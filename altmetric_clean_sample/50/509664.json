In this communication we report that p53-mediated NF-\u03baB2 up-regulation significantly contributes to the aggressive oncogenic behavior of cancer cells. Lowering the level of mutant p53 in a number of cancer cell lines resulted in a loss of GOF phenotypes directly implicating p53 mutants in the process. RNAi against NF-\u03baB2 in naturally occurring cancer cell lines also lowers GOF activities. In H1299 cells expressing mutant p53, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicate that mutant p53 induces histone acetylation at specific sites on the regulatory regions of its target genes. ChIP assays using antibodies against transcription factors putatively capable of interacting with the NF-\u03baB2 promoter show increased interaction of CBP and STAT2 in the presence of mutant p53. Thus, we propose that in H1299 cells, mutant p53 elevates expression of genes capable of enhancing cell proliferation, motility, and tumorigenicity by inducing acetylation of histones via recruitment of CBP and STAT2 on the promoters causing CBP-mediated histone acetylation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022ff","authors":["Vaughan CA","Singh S","Windle B","Sankala HM","Graves PR","Andrew Yeudall W","Deb SP","Deb S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.abb.2011.12.006","endpage":"88","first_seen_on":"2011-12-28T13:37:50+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1096-0384","0003-9861","00039861"],"issue":"1","journal":"Archives of Biochemistry & Biophysics","last_mentioned_on":1325079134,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22198284?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22198284","pubdate":"2011-12-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"79","subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"p53 mutants induce transcription of NF-\u03baB2 in H1299 cells through CBP and STAT binding on the NF-\u03baB2 promoter and gain of function activity.","type":"article","volume":"518","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/p53-mutants-induce-transcription-nf%CE%BAb2-h1299-cells-through-cbp-stat-binding-nf%CE%BAb2-promoter-gain-func"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6561091,"mean":6.0784637656243,"rank":4853521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":964035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6561091,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245187,"mean":4.687137642443,"rank":154575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44941,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245187,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1719,"mean":2.9178719441211,"rank":1488,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1719,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.8975714285714,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
