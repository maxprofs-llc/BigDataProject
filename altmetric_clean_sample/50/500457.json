Over a 9-year period (from November 2001 to October 2010) we reviewed all patients (n = 2,224) referred for DSE. Criteria for selection included patients > 18 years old who underwent DSE. We systematically analyzed all electrocardiograms obtained during DSE to detect ST-segment elevation during the examination. All patients with ST-segment elevation underwent coronary angiography. DSE was performed in 2,179 patients. ST-segment elevation was observed in 21 patients, all of whom underwent emergency coronary angiography. In 13 of these 21 patients (62%) significant coronary stenosis was observed: 6 patients with critical coronary stenosis and 7 patients with chronic coronary occlusion. The remaining 8 patients (38% of patients presenting with ST-segment elevation during DSE, 7 men, mean age 67 \u00b1 11 years) had no significant coronary stenosis. Prevalence of coronary artery spasm during DSE was 0.4%. In conclusion, physicians should be aware that, although rare, coronary artery spasm may occur during DSE.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f0","doi":"10.1016\/j.amjcard.2011.10.044","first_seen_on":"2011-12-20T07:40:06+00:00","issns":["00029149"],"journal":"American Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1330928693,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSCONTENT&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0002914911033777&_version=1&md5=8a0c06a1ab8f1560007e05de8c688b10&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22189013?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0002914911033777"],"pmid":"22189013","pubdate":"2011-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Prevalence of Coronary Artery Spasm During Dobutamine Stress Echocardiography ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-coronary-artery-spasm-during-dobutamine-stress-echocardiography-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630815,"mean":4.9285062716012,"rank":2696222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":889539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630815,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231730,"mean":3.9066080033145,"rank":141507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":84254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231730,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2351,"mean":3.1197710638298,"rank":1460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2351,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236,"mean":1.8247319148936,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/CardiologiaF\/status\/150170582963585025","citation_ids":[500457],"posted_on":"2011-12-23T11:07:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Cardiolog\u00eda-Fabumed","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1561758151\/fabumed_normal.png","description":"Cardiolog\u00eda.
