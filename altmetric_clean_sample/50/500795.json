The presence of the carboxylic acid groups is evidenced by fluorescence spectroscopy after their reaction with a diazomethane functionalized fluorescent dye. In addition, the initial light-responsive thin film, acting as a photoresist, can be easily patterned to selectively generate porosity in predetermined areas. In that way, fluorescent patterns can be obtained as evidenced by fluorescent microscopy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008096","authors":["Schumers, Jean\u2010Marc","Vlad, Alexandru","Huynen, Isabelle","Gohy, Jean\u2010Fran\u00e7ois","Fustin, Charles\u2010Andre"],"doi":"10.1002\/marc.201100739","endpage":"205","first_seen_on":"2011-12-20T12:14:24+00:00","issns":["1521-3927","1022-1336"],"issue":"3","journal":"Macromolecular Rapid Communications","last_mentioned_on":1324382557,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/marc.201100739"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/marc.201100739\/pdf","pmid":"22184052","pubdate":"2011-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"199","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Functionalized Nanoporous Thin Films From Photocleavable Block Copolymers","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/functionalized-nanoporous-thin-films-photocleavable-block-copolymers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631524,"mean":4.926174121992,"rank":2898538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631524,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231735,"mean":3.9028494394438,"rank":165923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231735,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1010,"mean":1.40796432111,"rank":374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1010,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247,"mean":1.3015447154472,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
