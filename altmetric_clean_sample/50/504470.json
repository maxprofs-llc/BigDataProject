Fourteen molars which had to be extracted were selected from patients 16-28 years old. The selection criteria include carious pulp exposure with a history of lingering pain. After isolation, caries removal and pulp exposure, MTA was used in pulpotomy treatment. Patients were evaluated for pain after 24 h. Two patients were lost from this study. Twelve teeth were extracted after 2 months and were assessed histologically. Recall examinations confirmed that none of the patients experienced pain after pulpotomy. Histological observation revealed that all samples had dentin bridge formation completely and that the pulps were vital and free of inflammation. Although the results favour the use of MTA as a pulpotomy material, more studies with larger samples and a longer recall period are suggested to justify the use of MTA for treatment of irreversible pulpitis in human permanent teeth.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f20","authors":["Eghbal, Mohammad Jafar","Asgary, Saeed","Baglue, Reza Ali","Parirokh, Masoud","Ghoddusi, Jamileh"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1747-4477.2009.00166.x","endpage":"8","first_seen_on":"2011-12-22T18:46:55+00:00","issns":["1747-4477","1329-1947","17474477"],"issue":"1","journal":"Australian Endodontic Journal","last_mentioned_on":1324578906,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1747-4477.2009.00166.x\/abstract#.TvN4J5Sqjoc.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1747-4477.2009.00166.x\/pdf","pmid":"19335509","pubdate":"2009-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Asia","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"4","subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"MTA pulpotomy of human permanent molars with irreversible pulpitis","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mta-pulpotomy-human-permanent-molars-irreversible-pulpitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6705730,"mean":6.1623148650933,"rank":4967849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":978467,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6705730,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243281,"mean":4.6880003370604,"rank":153946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243281,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":1.528,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
