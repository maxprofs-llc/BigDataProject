We investigated the utility of this strategy.Methods Systematic computer-based search in the online library Pubmed for randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trials (RCT) from the years 1990 to 2011.Results We found 14 RCT about augmentation of antidepressants with atypical antipsychotics in depressive patients with non-response to antidepressants. Trials examined olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine and aripiprazole.Conclusions Augmentation of antidepressants with atypical antipsychotics is an alternative to the augmentation with lithium in unipolar depressive patients with non-response to antidepressants. But treatment with atypical antipsychotics as opposed to placebo increases the risk of non-compliance due to side-effects of medication. Augmentation of antidepressants with atypical antipsychotics in unipolar depression is an off-label therapy in Germany except for the augmentation with extended-release quetiapine. Knowledge about treatment strategies regarding augmentation of antidepressants with atypical antipsychotics can increase the chance of a successful treatment, but interactions and side-effects should be considered.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f61000865b","doi":"10.1055\/s-0031-1277013","first_seen_on":"2011-12-23T11:49:19+00:00","issns":["1439-0876"],"journal":"Psychiatrische Praxis","last_mentioned_on":1324719352,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22189902?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22189902","pubdate":"2011-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"[Augmentation of Antidepressants with Atypical Antipsychotics in Non-Delusional Unipolar Depressed Patients with Non-Response to Antidepressant-Monotherapy.]","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/augmentation-von-antidepressiva-mit-atypischen-antipsychotika-bei-nonresponse-auf-eine-antidepressiv"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628216,"mean":4.9435109727551,"rank":2904357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628216,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231779,"mean":3.9294220504105,"rank":166955,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":572,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231779,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":1.3212173913043,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
