Two neural network classifiers are considered-a modified 3-layer perceptron LiRA and a modular assembly neural network. A method of feature selection is proposed that analyses connection weights formed in the preliminary learning process of a neural network classifier. In the experiments using the MNIST database of handwritten digits, the feature selection procedure allows reduction of feature number (from 60 000 to 7000) preserving comparable recognition capability while accelerating computations. Experimental comparison between the LiRA perceptron and the modular assembly neural network is accomplished, which shows that recognition capability of the modular assembly neural network is somewhat better.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f61000318d","doi":"10.1016\/j.neunet.2011.12.002","first_seen_on":"2011-12-24T07:43:35+00:00","issns":["08936080"],"journal":"Neural Networks","last_mentioned_on":1324712215,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSCONTENT&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0893608011003170&_version=1&md5=486369d4d31112b45f251d13757ac659&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"22391231","pubdate":"2011-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Neuroscience","Computer Science"],"title":"Investigation of efficient features for image recognition by neural networks.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/investigation-efficient-features-image-recognition-neural-networks-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629407,"mean":4.9349111287126,"rank":2901179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77929,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629407,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231572,"mean":3.9224909509397,"rank":166431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":729,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231572,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171,"mean":3.1702,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.68076923076923,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
