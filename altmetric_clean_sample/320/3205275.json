Because previous reports both support and refute the concept of catamenial epilepsy, we test the hypothesis by charting seizures and menses and measuring midluteal serum progesterone levels to estimate the frequency of epileptic women with catamenial seizure exacerbation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f4","authors":["A G Herzog","P Klein","B J Ransil"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T17:06:19+00:00","issns":["0013-9580"],"issue":"10","journal":"Epilepsia (Series 4)","last_mentioned_on":1259625070,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9579954"],"pmid":"9579954","pubdate":"1997-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","neurology"],"title":"Three patterns of catamenial epilepsy.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/three-patterns-catamenial-epilepsy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4840099,"mean":5.7736249319777,"rank":1179546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3069059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4840099,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171760,"mean":8.6038233105691,"rank":50177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":119341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171760,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1824,"mean":3.8374525507405,"rank":474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":1025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1824,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":5.1828,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Postgraduate":5,"Student  > Master":5,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":6,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":6},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":15,"Neuroscience":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":9,"Computer Science":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":2,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":2,"JP":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Catamenial epilepsy","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=328913467#altmetric_citation_10","license":"public","citation_ids":[3205272,3205275],"posted_on":"2009-11-30T23:51:10+00:00","summary":"Since at least the Greek times, there has been documented study of women with epilepsy and its correlation to the menstrual cycle.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=25260227","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"JessieTech","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:JessieTech"}}]}}
