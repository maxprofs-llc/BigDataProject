The aim of this study was to explore which demographic variables influenced the SERT availability most in a SPECT study with [(123)I]ADAM. Ninety-five healthy volunteers were recruited. Age, sex, smoking, alcohol intake, educational level, body mass index, seasonal change, and SERT availability were recorded and then analyzed by multivariate linear regression. Age was the only variable that was significantly associated with SERT availability (calculate: (midbrain-cerebellum)\/cerebellum). Furthermore, the inverse correlation of age and SERT availability may be present only before the age of 47. Age should be a covariate in SERT-related neuroimaging analyses, particularly in participants under the age of 47 years.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d3","doi":"10.1016\/j.pscychresns.2015.01.015","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T19:22:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0925-4927","09254927"],"journal":"Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging Section","last_mentioned_on":1427168872,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S092549271500027X","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S092549271500027X&_version=1&md5=9d3b531b3fbb459032dbda686f40ac69"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.psyn-journal.com\/article\/S092549271500027X\/pdf","pmid":"25670644","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"title":"Which demographic variables are necessary to correct in neuroimaging studies of serotonin transporter availability?
