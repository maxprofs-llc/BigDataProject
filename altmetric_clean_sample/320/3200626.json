The objective was to analyze the occurrence of vocal fatigue, hoarseness, and dry throat in elementary and high school teachers and their association with vocal habits, fluid intake, mastication, and sleep. A sample of 422 elementary and secondary school teachers was studied using a specific questionnaire. The multiple regression analysis showed that hoarseness was associated with absence of water intake (odds ratio (OR)=1.7; P=0.047), yelling\/speaking loudly (OR=1.6; P=0.058), jaw-opening limitations (OR=3.8; P=0.003), average of 6 hours of sleep\/night (OR=1.7; P=0.039), and waking-up feeling replenished (OR=2.0; P=0.020). The presence of vocal fatigue was significantly associated with yelling\/speaking loudly (OR=2.2; P=0.013), speaking excessively (OR=2.4; P=0.023), difficulty to open the mouth to masticate (OR=6.6; P=0.003), less than 6 hours of sleep (OR=4.0; P=0.008), and waking-up feeling replenished (sometimes OR=2.8; P=0.003; or never OR=3.3; P=0.002). The presence of dry throat was associated with being a former smoker (OR=3.3; P=0.011) and having jaw-opening limitations (OR=3.9; P=0.021). In recent years, speech and hearing interventions with teachers have focused on health-care promotion actions and prevention of vocal disorders, prioritizing issues related with hydration and healthy vocal use habits. However, the findings in the present study show the need to further focus on lifestyle habits related to sleep and eating habits.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ada","doi":"10.1016\/j.jvoice.2008.06.001","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T14:41:47+00:00","issns":["0892-1997"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Voice","last_mentioned_on":1364170980,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0892199708000878#ref_bib11"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jvoice.org\/article\/S0892199708000878\/pdf","pmid":"19135852","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Performing Arts And Creative Writing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Health Professions"],"startpage":"86","subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Influence of Abusive Vocal Habits, Hydration, Mastication, and Sleep in the Occurrence of Vocal Symptoms in Teachers","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-abusive-vocal-habits-hydration-mastication-sleep-occurrence-vocal-symptoms-teachers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629479,"mean":4.9344089205159,"rank":816457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629479,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94957,"mean":8.1037294115171,"rank":24737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94957,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":357,"mean":1.9761966292135,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":357,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.1816666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
