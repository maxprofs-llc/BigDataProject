This report summarizes a survey of SEP activities in the United States for January-December 2002 and compares the results with those of previous surveys. The findings indicate that in 2002, for the first time in 8 years, the number of SEPs, the number of localities with SEPs, and public funding for SEPs decreased nationwide; however, the number of syringes exchanged and total budgets across all programs continued to increase. SEPs can help prevent bloodborne pathogen transmission by increasing access to sterile syringes among IDUs and enabling safe disposal of used syringes. Often, programs also provide other public health services, such as HIV testing, risk-reduction education, and referrals for substance-abuse treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5063cf058f6100030f9","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T15:30:13+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"27","journal":"MMWR: Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report","last_mentioned_on":1306785468,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16015218"],"pmid":"16015218","pubdate":"2005-07-15T23:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Update: syringe exchange programs--United States, 2002.","type":"article","volume":"54"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632408,"mean":4.9240837059336,"rank":815992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632408,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95338,"mean":8.1347156927533,"rank":24918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95338,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":578,"mean":4.0982114384749,"rank":138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":578,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":5.7827586206897,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Needle exchange programme","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=431706328#altmetric_citation_20","license":"public","citation_ids":[3202210],"posted_on":"2011-05-30T19:57:48+00:00","summary":"A needle and syringe programme (NSP) or syringe-exchange programme (SEP) is a social service that allows injecting drug users (IDUs) to obtain hypodermic needles and associated paraphernalia at little or no cost.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=320340","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"LeadSongDog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:LeadSongDog"}}]}}
