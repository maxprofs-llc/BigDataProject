Fusion was most frequent with the field strength of 1 kV\/cm and direct current pulses of 100-250 microsec duration. An electrolyte solution (PBS) can be used instead of a non-electrolyte solution (0.3 M mannitol). The viability of blastomeres fused in these two types of solution is similar. Fused 2-cell blastomeres develop into tetraploid blastocysts but die after implantation. Embryos in which blastomeres failed to fuse despite the treatment (diploid controls) can develop till term. The technique can also be applied to 3- and 4-cell embryos and to zona-free oocytes and blastomeres.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002890","authors":["J Z Kubiak","A K Tarkowski"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T18:16:56+00:00","issns":["0014-4827"],"issue":"2","journal":"Experimental Cell Research","last_mentioned_on":1293903700,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3884349"],"pmid":"3884349","pubdate":"1985-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Electrofusion of mouse blastomeres.","type":"article","volume":"157","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electrofusion-mouse-blastomeres"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622349,"mean":4.9310300946799,"rank":816055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2282679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622349,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93729,"mean":7.3291508530093,"rank":23986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93729,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1023,"mean":2.2741839530333,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1023,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.2416666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
