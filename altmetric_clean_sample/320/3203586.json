Recently, a TATA box mutation of UGT1A1 (UGT1A1*28), a common genotype leading to Gilbert's syndrome, and several missense mutations of other UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT1) family members have been described. Furthermore, co-occurrence of UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A6*2 has been observed. In order to elucidate the basis for co-occurrence of UGT1 mutations, fluorescence resonance energy transfer techniques were developed for rapid determination of polymorphisms of three UGT isoforms (UGT1A1*28, 1A6*2, and 1A7*2\/*3). Hundred healthy Caucasians and 50 Egyptians were genotyped. All genotypes followed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Only three major haplotypes were found, including a haplotype consisting of allelic variants of all three isoforms (29% in Caucasians and 22% in Egyptians), all leading to reduced UGT activity. Frequent haplotypes containing several UGT1 allelic variants should be taken into account in studies on the association between diseases, abnormal drug reactions, and UGT1 family polymorphisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c2","authors":["Christoph K\u00f6hle","Bernd M\u00f6hrle","Peter A M\u00fcnzel","Matthias Schwab","Dorothee Wernet","Osama A Badary","Karl Walter Bock"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T16:08:19+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0006-2952"],"issue":"9","journal":"Biochemical Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1327710728,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12732365"],"pmid":"12732365","pubdate":"2003-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Frequent co-occurrence of the TATA box mutation associated with Gilbert's syndrome (UGT1A1*28) with other polymorphisms of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1 locus (UGT1A6*2 and UGT1A7*3) in Caucasians and Egyptians.","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/frequent-cooccurrence-tata-box-mutation-associated-gilberts-syndrome-ugt1a128-other-polymorphisms-ud"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3908267,"mean":5.0146754749866,"rank":892435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2465138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3908267,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119859,"mean":9.0108938023564,"rank":35611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":82615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119859,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1166,"mean":2.6147697594502,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1166,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.3725,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Gilbert's syndrome","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=209790765#altmetric_citation_6","license":"public","citation_ids":[3203584,3203586],"posted_on":"2008-05-02T22:20:36+00:00","summary":"Gilbert's syndrome, often shortened to GS, also called Gilbert\u2013Meulengracht syndrome, is a genetic liver disorder and the most common hereditary cause of increased bilirubin and is found in up to 5% of the population (though some gastroenterologists mainta","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=335623","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"DOI bot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:DOI bot"}},{"title":"UGT1A7 (gene)","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=473606651#altmetric_citation_9","license":"public","citation_ids":[3203586],"posted_on":"2012-01-28T00:32:08+00:00","summary":"UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A7 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the UGT1A7 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=34520041","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
