Daily pollution loads at the Jadro River spring for total N ranged from 0 to 304 kg, for NH3-N from 0 to 38 kg, for NO3-N from 0-1321 kg and for PO4-P from 0-92 kg in the period from September 1993 to September 2003. When compared with MAC loads the results prove that the Jadro River spring is not polluted by nitrogen compounds and phosphorus. The average annual load for total N ranged from 10 to 33 t, for NH3-N from 0.25 to 5.15 t, for NO3-N from 40 to 190 t, and for PO4-P from 0.3 to 11.5 t. The nitrogen compounds and phosphorus loads vary from one year to another without any constant decreasing or increasing trends. The annual average loads compared with the average annual MAC loads (especially for NH3-N and PO4-P) show that there were no threats of constant pollution of the spring. The loads for total N and PO4-P along the Jadro River flow from the spring to the fishpond entrance were monitored over a five year period from September 1999 to September 2004. The results show no regularities. The highest annual total nitrogen load of 45 t was recorded at the entrance to the fishpond during the 2002\/2003 period. The highest annual PO4-P load of 10 t was measured at the Vidovi\u0107 Bridge during the 2003\/2004 period; however, the concentrations of N and P did not exceed the MAC concentrations which are prescribed for drinking water. According to the investigation results of the daily and average annual loads compared with MAC loads for drinking water, it can be concluded that the Jadro River spring and its streamflow are not polluted by nitrogen and phosphorus.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006531","authors":["Nives \u0160tambuk-Giljanovi\u0107"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10661-005-9066-8","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T15:12:10+00:00","issns":["1573-2959"],"issue":"1-3","journal":"Environmental Monitoring & Assessment","last_mentioned_on":1440535996,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/337131806h5t3n47\/","http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/337131806h5t3n47"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10661-005-9066-8.pdf","pmid":"17054013","pubdate":"2006-10-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Kluwer Academic Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"The Pollution Load by Nitrogen and Phosphorus IN the Jadro River","type":"article","volume":"123","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pollution-load-nitrogen-phosphorus-jadro-river"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5526446,"mean":6.3981344242107,"rank":1402605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3497652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5526446,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192688,"mean":8.6555062043626,"rank":57266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":132644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192688,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":624,"mean":2.5700096308186,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":624,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.588358974359,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":5,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Jadro Spring","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=669025733#altmetric_citation_f3001a98-02d6-4be5-a539-f73d6b82458f","license":"public","citation_ids":[3201551],"posted_on":"2015-06-28T10:58:43+00:00","summary":"The Jadro Spring is a water source rising in the Dinaric Alps in Croatia.
