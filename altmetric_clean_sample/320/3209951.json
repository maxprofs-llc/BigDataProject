Twenty-six mAbs were reactive to SARS-CoV by ELISA, and nine were chosen for detailed characterization. Five mAbs reacted against the S protein, two against the M protein, and one each against the N and E proteins. Two of five S protein mAbs neutralized SARS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells and reacted to an epitope within amino acids 490-510 in the S protein. While two of the three non-neutralizing antibodies recognized at second epitope within amino acids 270-350. The mAbs characterized should prove useful for developing SARS-CoV diagnostic assays and for studying the biology of infection and pathogenesis of disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f91","authors":["Tripp RA","Haynes LM","Moore D","Anderson B","Tamin A","Harcourt BH","Jones LP","Yilla M","Babcock GJ","Greenough T","Ambrosino DM","Alvarez R","Callaway J","Cavitt S","Kamrud K","Alterson H","Smith J","Harcourt JL","Miao C","Razdan R","Comer JA","Rollin PE","Ksiazek TG","Sanchez A","Rota PA","Bellini WJ","Anderson LJ"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jviromet.2005.03.021","endpage":"28","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T19:22:36+00:00","issns":["01660934"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","last_mentioned_on":1474389237,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jviromet.2005.03.021","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15885812","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15885812"],"pmid":"15885812","pubdate":"2005-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"21","title":"Monoclonal antibodies to SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV): identification of neutralizing and antibodies reactive to S, N, M and E viral proteins.","type":"article","volume":"128","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/monoclonal-antibodies-sarsassociated-coronavirus-sarscov-identification-neutralizing-antibodies-reac"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":2159292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5101353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243262,"mean":8.2736570432581,"rank":69842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":167413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243262,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":765,"mean":2.0443272251309,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":765,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.81176470588235,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
