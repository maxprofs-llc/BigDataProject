The change to a scientifically sound discipline was initiated by the two scientific pioneers of modern implant dentistry, Professor P. I. Br\u00e5nemark from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden and Professor Andr\u00e9 Schroeder from the University of Bern in Switzerland. Together with their teams, and independently of each other, they laid the foundation for the most significant development and paradigm shift in dental medicine. The present volume of Periodontology 2000 celebrates 50\u00a0years of osseointegration. It reviews the progress of implant therapy over the past 50\u00a0years, including the basics of implant surgery required to achieve osseointegration on a predictable basis and evolving innovations. The development of bone-augmentation techniques, such as guided bone regeneration and sinus floor elevation, to correct local bone defects at potential implant sites has increased the indications for implant therapy. The paradigm shift to moderately rough implant surfaces resulted in faster and enhanced bone integration and led to improvements in various treatment protocols, such as immediate and early implant placement in postextraction sites, and made various loading protocols possible, including immediate and early implant loading. In the past 15 years, preoperative analysis and presurgical planning improved as a result of the introduction of three-dimensional imaging techniques. Hereby, cone-beam computed tomography offers better image quality with reduced radiation exposure, when compared with dental computed tomography. This opened the door for digital planning and surgical modifications. Over the last 50\u00a0years this evolution has facilitated tremendous progress in esthetic outcomes with implant-supported prostheses and improved patient-centered outcomes. This volume of Periodontology 2000 also discusses the current trends and open questions of implant dentistry, such as the potential of digital implant dentistry in the surgical and prosthetic field, the trend for an increasing average age of implant patients and the related adaptations of treatment protocols, and the second attempt to establish ceramic implants using, this time, zirconia as the implant material. Finally, some of the hottest controversies are discussed, such as recent suggestions on bone integration being a potential foreign-body reaction and the evidence-based appraisal of the peri-implantitis debate.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032c7","authors":["Buser, Daniel","Sennerby, Lars","De Bruyn, Hugo"],"doi":"10.1111\/prd.12185","endpage":"21","first_seen_on":"2016-12-25T14:36:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1600-0757"],"issue":"1","journal":"Periodontology 2000","last_mentioned_on":1482676551,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/prd.12185\/pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/prd.12185\/pdf","pmid":"28000280","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"7","subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Modern implant dentistry based on osseointegration: 50\u00a0years of progress, current trends and open questions","type":"article","volume":"73","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modern-implant-dentistry-based-osseointegration-50years-progress-current-trends-open-questions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7936934,"mean":6.7106933012983,"rank":4163984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2214693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7936934,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252489,"mean":12.472584011913,"rank":140940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":87538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252489,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":2.3571641791045,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.95,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
