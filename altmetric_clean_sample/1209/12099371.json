We generated and characterized HIV-1 primary isolates from antiretroviral na\u00efve infected Indian children, and determined their susceptibility to known NAbs. All the 8 isolates belonged to subtype-C and were R5 tropic. Majority of these viruses were resistant to neutralization by NAbs, suggesting that the bnAbs, known to efficiently neutralize pseudoviruses (adult and pediatric) of different strains, are less effective against pediatric primary isolates. Interestingly, AIIMS_329 isolate displayed high susceptibility to neutralization by PG9 and PG16bnAbs, with IC50 titer of 1.3 and 0.97\u03bcg\/ml, suggesting exposure of this epitope on this virus. All isolates except AIIMS_506 were neutralized by contemporaneous plasma antibodies. Our findings suggest that primary isolates, due to close resemblance to viruses in natural infection, should be used to evaluate NAbs as effective vaccine candidates in both children and adults.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003769","authors":["Makhdoomi, Muzamil Ashraf","Singh, Deepti","Nair Pananghat, Ambili","Lodha, Rakesh","Kabra, Sushil Kumar","Luthra, Kalpana","Muzamil Ashraf Makhdoomi","Deepti Singh","Ambili Nair Pananghat","Rakesh Lodha","Sushil Kumar Kabra","Kalpana Luthra"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.virol.2016.09.011","endpage":"113","first_seen_on":"2016-09-20T11:09:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-0341","00426822"],"journal":"Virology","last_mentioned_on":1474613793,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27643887?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.virol.2016.09.011"],"pmid":"27643887","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"105","title":"Neutralization resistant HIV-1 primary isolates from antiretroviral na\u00efve chronically infected children in India","type":"article","volume":"499","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neutralization-resistant-hiv1-primary-isolates-antiretroviral-na%C3%AFve-chronically-infected-children-in"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":3967220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4421645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253800,"mean":12.663992568922,"rank":117946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":134312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253800,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2508,"mean":3.6276290386917,"rank":1527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2508,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":3.2028717948718,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
