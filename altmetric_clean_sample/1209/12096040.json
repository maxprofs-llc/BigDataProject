To thoroughly explore its metabolism in vivo, an HPLC-ESI-IT-TOF-MS(n) method combined with specific metabolite detection strategy was used to detect and identify the metabolites of taxifolin in rats. Of the 191 metabolites tentatively identified, 154 were new metabolites, 69 were new compounds and 32 were dimers. This is the first report of the in vivo biotransformation of a single compound into more than 100 metabolites. Furthermore, acetylamination and pyroglutamic acid conjugation were identified as new metabolic reactions. Seventeen metabolites were found to have various taxifolin-related bioactivities. The potential targets of taxifolin and 63 metabolites were predicted using PharmMapper, with results showing that more than 60 metabolites have the same five targets. Metabolites with the same fragment pattern may have the same pharmacophore. Thus these metabolites may exert the same pharmacological effects as taxifolin through an additive effect on the same drug targets. This observation indicates that taxifolin is bioactive not only in the parent form, but also through its metabolites. These findings enhance understanding of the metabolism and effective forms of taxifolin and may provide further insight of the beneficial effects of taxifolin and its derivatives.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Ping Yang"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules21091209","first_seen_on":"2016-09-20T06:31:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"9","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1474353060,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/21\/9\/1209"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/21\/9\/1209\/pdf","pmid":"27649117","pubdate":"2016-09-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1209","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Detection of 191 Taxifolin Metabolites and Their Distribution in Rats Using HPLC-ESI-IT-TOF-MSn","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detection-191-taxifolin-metabolites-distribution-rats-using-hplcesiittofmsn"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":7268080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253630,"mean":12.666519412212,"rank":209647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253630,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3970,"mean":2.1418453010834,"rank":2759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3970,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196,"mean":3.2341538461538,"rank":164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
