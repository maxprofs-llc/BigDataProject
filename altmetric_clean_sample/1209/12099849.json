We assessed patient adherence to follow-up visits in the second year (quality-reporting year), calculated the proportion of patients that completed routine examinations for glycemic control and complications, and evaluated associations between characteristics of patients and quality indicators using multivariable logistic regression models.\nWe identified 12\u2005909 patients with diabetes; in the subject-identification year, 1415 (11.0%) had prescriptions for insulin injections, 6049 (46.9%) had prescriptions for oral antihyperglycemic agents, and 5445 (42.2%) had no diabetes-related prescriptions. Among patients using medication, 474 (6.4%) dropped out in the quality-reporting year. The adjusted percentages of quality indicators among patients using oral antihyperglycemic agents were 95.8% for glycated hemoglobin, 35.6% for eye examinations, 15.4% for urine microalbumin excretion, and 90.6% for serum lipids; the percentages among patients taking insulin were the same or higher. Annual testing for glycated hemoglobin was less frequent in patients aged 40-49\u2005years than in patients aged 60-69\u2005years (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.91). Fewer men than women (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.64), and fewer patients aged 40-49\u2005years than those aged 60-69\u2005years (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.63) tended to complete routine eye examinations.\nScreening for retinopathy and nephropathy was less frequent than required despite favorable conditions for access to healthcare in Japan. Suboptimal quality of care appeared to depend on provider factors as well as patient factors, such as limited access to retinopathy prevention among working-age men with diabetes.","altmetric_jid":"538ee21b2a83ee2c148b4568","authors":["Hirokazu Tanaka","Jun Tomio","Takehiro Sugiyama","Yasuki Kobayashi"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjdrc-2016-000291","first_seen_on":"2016-09-20T12:02:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[" 2052-4897","2052-4897"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care","last_mentioned_on":1474372935,"links":["http:\/\/drc.bmj.com\/content\/4\/1\/e000291.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/drc.bmj.com\/content\/4\/1\/e000291.full.pdf","pmid":"27651912","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Diabetes Association","startpage":"e000291","title":"Process quality of diabetes care under favorable access to healthcare: a 2-year longitudinal study using claims data in Japan","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/process-quality-diabetes-care-under-favorable-access-healthcare-2year-longitudinal-study-using-claim"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":6080524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2027506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253630,"mean":12.666353618868,"rank":164669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":75173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253630,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":219,"mean":17.055688073394,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":219,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":60.882380952381,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
