Varying weighting approaches and MI were compared with regard to the calculation of relative risks, absolute risks and predictive abilities including C-index, the net reclassification improvement (NRI) and calibration.\nThe full cohort comprised 21,845 participants and the case-cohort 2,703 participants. Relative risks were similar across all methods and compatible with full cohort estimates. Absolute risk estimates showed stronger disagreement mainly for Prentice and Self&Prentice weighting. Barlow and Langholz&Jiao weighting methods and MI were in good agreement with full cohort analysis. Predictive abilities were closest to full cohort estimates for MI or for Barlow and Langholz&Jiao weighting.\nMI seems to be a valid method for deriving or extending a risk prediction model from case-cohort data and might be superior for absolute risk calculation when compared to weighted approaches.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cfd","authors":["Kristin M\u00fchlenbruch","Olga Kuxhaus","Romina di Giuseppe","Heiner Boeing","Cornelia Weikert","Matthias B.
