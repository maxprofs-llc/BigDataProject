Current assays fail to accurately identify recipients with slow hematopoietic recovery and distinguish them from those with pending graft failure. To address this, we prospectively examined the kinetics of immune cell subset recovery in the peripheral blood of 39 patients on days 7 and 14 after double-unit CBT (dCBT) by multiparametric flow cytometry analysis, which we called real time immunophenotyping (RTIP). RTIP analysis at day 14 revealed distinctive patterns of reconstitution and importantly identified patients with slow hematopoietic recovery who went on to engraft. Strikingly, higher absolute number of circulating monocytes and NK cells at day 14 were predictive of engraftment but only the absolute number of circulating monocytes significantly correlated with time to engraftment. This is the first evidence that RTIP on patient PBMCs early after dCBT is technically feasible and can be used as a \"signature\" for predicting the kinetics of hematopoietic recovery. Furthermore, RTIP is a time and cost efficient methodology that has the potential to become a clinically feasible diagnostic tool to guide therapeutic interventions in high risk patients; therefore, its utility should be evaluated in a large cohort of patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e3","authors":["Jianqiang Li","Ian Nicoud","Joseph Blake","David Oliver","Emily Cox","Shelly Heimfeld","Filippo Milano","Suzan Imren","Colleen Delaney"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbmt.2016.12.625","first_seen_on":"2017-03-21T14:02:23+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["10838791"],"journal":"Biology of Blood & Marrow Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1490104811,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1083879116311843?sf48525760=1","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1083879116311843?sf48525890=1"],"pmid":"28007666","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Real Time Immunophenotyping of Leukocyte Subsets Early after Double Cord Blood Transplantation Predicts Graft Function","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1083879116311843","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/real-time-immunophenotyping-leukocyte-subsets-early-after-double-cord-blood-transplantation-predicts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":6068412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2023421,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248083,"mean":13.359717851355,"rank":164154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":69434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248083,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1405,"mean":3.7843903133903,"rank":969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1405,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":8.2534065934066,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ELShematology\/statuses\/844186857197965312","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17856253],"posted_on":"2017-03-21T14:00:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Elsevier Hematology","url":"http:\/\/www.hematologyadvance.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/615567362125889536\/9abt9Dl8_normal.jpg","description":"Tweets about our Hematology books and  journals, related research news for scientists, students, practitioners, industry and everyone else who is interested","id_on_source":"ELShematology","tweeter_id":"1934440580","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3376},"tweet_id":"844186857197965312"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1304868516261173&id=529920997089266","license":"public","citation_ids":[17856253],"posted_on":"2017-03-21T14:00:11+00:00","summary":"Real Time #Immunophenotyping of Leukocyte Subsets Early after Double Cord Blood Transplant Predicts Graft Function http:\/\/bit.ly\/2nGkOB3","author":{"name":"Elsevier Hematology","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/529920997089266","facebook_wall_name":"Elsevier Hematology","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/529920997089266\/picture","id_on_source":"529920997089266"}}]}}
