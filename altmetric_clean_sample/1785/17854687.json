Early measurement of disease severity, combined with a recommendation for skin protection and use of appropriate medication can prevent the disease from worsening. Current diagnosis can be costly and time-consuming. In this paper, an automatic eczema detection and severity measurement model are presented using modern image processing and computer algorithm. The system can successfully detect regions of eczema and classify the identified region as mild or severe based on image color and texture feature. Then the model automatically measures skin parameters used in the most common assessment tool called \"Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI),\" by computing eczema affected area score, eczema intensity score, and body region score of eczema allowing both patients and physicians to accurately assess the affected skin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9253cf058f61000dc6b","authors":["Alam, Md Nafiul","Munia, Tamanna Tabassum Khan","Tavakolian, Kouhyar","Vasefi, Fartash","MacKinnon, Nick","Fazel-Rezai, Reza"],"doi":"10.1109\/embc.2016.7590961","first_seen_on":"2017-03-21T12:53:09+00:00","issns":["1557-170X"],"journal":"Conference proceedings Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","last_mentioned_on":1488427027,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28226757"],"pmid":"28226757","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Automatic detection and severity measurement of eczema using image processing","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/automatic-detection-severity-measurement-eczema-using-image-processing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":2.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":3299357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4969897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246152,"mean":13.293621273121,"rank":91162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":153778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246152,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1486,"mean":1.5567003367003,"rank":188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":1296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1486,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":3.1388888888889,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
