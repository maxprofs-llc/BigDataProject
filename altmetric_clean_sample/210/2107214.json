The incorporation of curcumin inside a nanoglobul should improve curcumin stability and permeability. A nanoemulsion was prepared by the self-nanoemulsification method, using an oil phase of glyceryl monooleate, Cremophor RH40 and polyethylene glycol 400. Evaluation of the nanoemulsion included analysis of particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, physical stability, Raman spectrum and morphology. In addition, the physical performance of the nanoemulsion in Viscolam AT 100P gel was studied. A modified vertical diffusion cell and shed snake skin of Python reticulatus were used to study the in vitro permeation of curcumin. A spontaneously formed stable nanoemulsion has a loading capacity of 350\u2009mg curcumin\/10\u2009g of oil phase. The mean droplet diameter, polydispersity index and zeta potential of optimized nanoemulsion were 85.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\u2009nm, 0.18\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0 and -5.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009mV, respectively. Curcumin in a nanoemulsion was more stable than unencapsulated curcumin. Furthermore, nanoemulsification significantly improved the permeation flux of curcumin from the hydrophilic matrix gel; the release kinetic of curcumin changed from zero order to a Higuchi release profile. Overall, the developed nanoemulsion system not only improved curcumin permeability but also protected the curcumin from chemical degradation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5613cf058f61000494d","authors":["Heni Rachmawati","Dewa Ken Budiputra","Rachmat Mauludin"],"doi":"10.3109\/03639045.2014.884127","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2014-02-08T06:47:53+00:00","issns":["0363-9045","1520-5762"],"journal":"Drug Development & Industrial Pharmacy","last_mentioned_on":1454066824,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/03639045.2014.884127","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/03639045.2014.884127?ai=9es&mi=3j7h3l&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24502271?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24502271","pubdate":"2014-02-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["pharmacy"],"title":"Curcumin nanoemulsion for transdermal application: formulation and evaluation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/curcumin-nanoemulsion-transdermal-application-formulation-evaluation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7060796,"mean":6.2779102203052,"rank":2798529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4158903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7060796,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188807,"mean":7.1739252354271,"rank":62870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":122505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188807,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":394,"mean":2.0639389312977,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":394,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":0.72142857142857,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
