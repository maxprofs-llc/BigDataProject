This observation led to the interpretation that BRCA1\/2 mutations are embryo-lethal, unless rescued by 'low FMR1 alleles'. We undertook to re-explore the distribution of FMR1 alleles subdivided into low, normal and high (<26, 26-34, and >34 CGG repeats, respectively) subgenotypes, on a cohort of 125 Ashkenazi women, carriers of a BRCA1\/2 founder mutation. Ashkenazi healthy females (n=368), tested in the frame of the Israeli screening population program, served as controls. BRCA1\/2 carriers and controls demonstrated a comparable and non-skewed FMR1 subgenotype distribution. Taken together, using a homogeneous ethnic group of Ashkenazi BRCA1\/2 mutation carriers, we could not confirm the reported association between FMR1 low genotypes and BRCA1\/2 mutations. The notion that BRCA1\/2 mutations are embryo-lethal unless rescued by the low FMR1 subgenotypes is hereby refuted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002836","authors":["Efrat Dagan","Yoram Cohen","Adi Mory","Vardit Adir","Zvi Borochowitz","Hila Raanani","Alina Kurolap","Svetlana Melikhan-Revzin","Dror Meirow","Ruth Gershoni-Baruch"],"doi":"10.1038\/ejhg.2013.281","endpage":"279","first_seen_on":"2014-02-05T17:33:09+00:00","issns":["1018-4813","1476-5438"],"journal":"European Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1391621529,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ejhg\/journal\/v22\/n2\/full\/ejhg2013281a.html"],"pmid":"24281364","pubdate":"2013-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"277","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"BRCA1|[sol]|2 mutations and FMR1 alleles are randomly distributed: a case control study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/brca12-mutations-fmr1-alleles-randomly-distributed-case-control-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616992,"mean":4.9287830669226,"rank":1808503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1633233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616992,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109834,"mean":6.8603771726167,"rank":47585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":56016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109834,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1253,"mean":5.4884776357827,"rank":839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1253,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":9.4501333333333,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
