Thus, a derivatization of the steroids prior to the measurement is compulsory, and a correction of the isotopic data is often necessary. To overcome this limitation, we present a new approach of high-temperature liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array detection and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (HT-LC\/PDA\/IRMS) for the carbon isotope ratio analysis of unconjugated steroids. A steroid mixture containing 19-norandrosterone, testosterone, epitestosterone, androsterone, and 5\u03b2-pregnane-3\u03b1,17\u03b1,20\u03b1-triol was fully separated on a C4 column under high-temperature elution with water as the sole eluent. The accuracy for isotope analysis (\u00b10.5 \u2030) was around 20 \u03bcg g(-1) for testosterone, epitestosterone (79 ng steroid absolute on column), and 30 \u03bcg g(-1) for 19-norandrosterone, androsterone, and 5\u03b2-pregnane-3\u03b1,17\u03b1,20\u03b1-triol (119 ng steroid absolute on column). The applicability of the method was tested by measuring a pharmaceutical gel containing testosterone. With this work, the scope of LC\/IRMS applications has been extended to nonpolar compounds.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Lijun Zhang","Mario Thevis","Thomas Piper","J.
