These characteristics make it an excellent model system for studying the early evolution of metabolism. Here we present the whole-genome metabolic network of this organism and examine in detail the driving forces that have shaped it. We make extensive use of phylometabolic analysis, a method we recently introduced that generates trees of metabolic phenotypes by integrating phylogenetic and metabolic constraints. We reconstruct the evolution of a range of metabolic sub-systems, including the reductive citric acid (rTCA) cycle, as well as the biosynthesis and functional roles of several amino acids and cofactors. We show that A. aeolicus uses the reconstructed ancestral pathways within many of these sub-systems, and highlight how the evolutionary interconnections between sub-systems facilitated several key innovations. Our analyses further highlight three general classes of driving forces in metabolic evolution. One is the duplication and divergence of genes for enzymes as these progress from lower to higher substrate specificity, improving the kinetics of certain sub-systems. A second is the kinetic optimization of established pathways through fusion of enzymes, or their organization into larger complexes. The third is the minimization of the ATP unit cost to synthesize biomass, improving thermodynamic efficiency. Quantifying the distribution of these classes of innovations across metabolic sub-systems and across the tree of life will allow us to assess how a tradeoff between maximizing growth rate and growth efficiency has shaped the long-term metabolic evolution of the biosphere.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Rogier Braakman","Eric Smith"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0087950","first_seen_on":"2014-02-06T02:13:42+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"2","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1421321286,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0087950","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0087950","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24516572","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24516572?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0087950.pdf","pmid":"24516572","pubdate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e87950","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Metabolic evolution of a deep-branching hyperthermophilic chemoautotrophic bacterium.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolic-evolution-deepbranching-hyperthermophilic-chemoautotrophic-bacterium-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4739474,"mean":5.4857892300663,"rank":363483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":4375082,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4739474,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126517,"mean":7.9371974611907,"rank":13212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":113275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126517,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83341,"mean":8.8751530597552,"rank":10111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":73209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83341,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002,"mean":8.8583897012873,"rank":836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
