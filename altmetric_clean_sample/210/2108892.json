Subjects were assessed by PHC physicians using a sexual dysfunction semistructured questionnaire and a questionnaire designed for medical history and sociodemographic data. Clinical assessments for peripheral vascular disease and peripheral neuropathy were carried out for the diabetic group only. The estimated high prevalence rate of sexual dysfunction among the diabetic group (89.2%) was significantly greater than the hypertensive group (43.6%), and the apparently healthy group (16.7%). The commonest clinical presentations of sexual dysfunction among the diabetic men were impaired morning and spontaneous erections, erectile weakness, and ejaculatory disturbances. Lesser common presentations were reduced sexual interest and complete erectile failure. There were no significant associations between the sexual dysfunction and clinically obvious physical complications of diabetes, or factors that might affect sexual functioning (i.e., alcohol or drug misuse or marital disharmony). However, the validity of these results is questioned due to the small numbers used for statistical analysis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002eec","authors":["O E el-Rufaie","A Bener","M S Abuzeid","T A Ali","el-Rufaie, O E","Bener, A","Abuzeid, M S","Ali, T A"],"first_seen_on":"2014-02-09T21:54:37+00:00","issns":["0022-3999"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Psychosomatic Research","last_mentioned_on":1392159600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9430073"],"pmid":"9430073","pubdate":"1997-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Sexual dysfunction among type II diabetic men: a controlled study.","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sexual-dysfunction-among-type-ii-diabetic-men-controlled-study-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627150,"mean":4.9502167410311,"rank":169591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":3456391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627150,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111961,"mean":6.972947123973,"rank":7598,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":104323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111961,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":665,"mean":4.4877560240964,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":665,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.03216,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Erectile dysfunction may be more than just a problem in bed","url":"http:\/\/theconversation.com\/erectile-dysfunction-may-be-more-than-just-a-problem-in-bed-21528","license":"public","citation_ids":[2108885,2108886,2108887,198890,2108889,2108890,2108891,2076118,2108892],"posted_on":"2014-02-09T19:06:28+00:00","summary":"Erection problems are common but they can be embarrassing for men to discuss with partners and doctors.
