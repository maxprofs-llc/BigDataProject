Cognitive behavioral therapy has demonstrated efficacy in reducing anxiety and worry in older adults, but the generalizability of these findings to community-dwelling older adults is unknown. The aim of the current study is to examine the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral intervention delivered by telephone in reducing anxiety and worry in rural community-dwelling older adults with GAD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d7","doi":"10.1186\/1471-244x-14-34","first_seen_on":"2014-02-08T15:50:44+00:00","issns":["1471-244X"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1393039861,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-244X\/14\/34\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24506950?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=anxietynews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-244X-14-34.pdf","pmid":"24506950","pubdate":"2014-02-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"34","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Telephone-delivered psychotherapy for rural-dwelling older adults with generalized anxiety disorder: study protocol of a randomized controlled trial","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/telephonedelivered-psychotherapy-ruraldwelling-older-adults-generalized-anxiety-disorder-study-proto-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506837,"mean":5.127001515923,"rank":2324946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1546084,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506837,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124677,"mean":7.68508742661,"rank":60845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":44130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124677,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1485,"mean":4.8897264150943,"rank":1105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1485,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":5.3927441860465,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
