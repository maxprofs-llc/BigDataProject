Two recent studies showed changes in primary visual cortex (V1) during normal aging; however, no studies have characterized the effects of aging on visual cortex beyond V1, important measurements both for understanding the aging process and for comparison to changes in age-related diseases. Similarly, there is almost no information about changes in visual cortex in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Because visual deficits are often reported as one of the first symptoms of AD, measurements of such changes in the visual cortex of AD patients might improve our understanding of how the visual system is affected by neurodegeneration as well as aid early detection, accurate diagnosis and timely treatment of AD. Here we use fMRI to first compare the visual field map (VFM) organization and population receptive fields (pRFs) between young adults and healthy aging subjects for occipital VFMs V1, V2, V3, and hV4. Healthy aging subjects do not show major VFM organizational deficits, but do have reduced surface area and increased pRF sizes in the foveal representations of V1, V2, and hV4 relative to healthy young control subjects. These measurements are consistent with behavioral deficits seen in healthy aging. We then demonstrate the feasibility and first characterization of these measurements in two patients with mild AD, which reveal potential changes in visual cortex as part of the pathophysiology of AD. Our data aid in our understanding of the changes in the visual processing pathways in normal aging and provide the foundation for future research into earlier and more definitive detection of AD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc1b","authors":["Brewer, Alyssa A.","Barton, Brian"],"doi":"10.3389\/fpsyg.2014.00074","first_seen_on":"2014-02-07T08:47:48+00:00","issns":["1664-1078"],"journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1393510808,"links":["http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2014.00074\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24570669?dopt=Abstract&holding=f1000,f1000m&tool=cdl&otool=cdlotool"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/DownloadFile\/1\/86775\/36659\/1\/21\/fpsyg-05-00074_pdf","pmid":"24570669","pubdate":"2014-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Visual cortex in aging and Alzheimer's disease: changes in visual field maps and population receptive fields","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/visual-cortex-aging-alzheimers-disease-changes-visual-field-maps-population-receptive-fields-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2669489,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1696660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139559,"mean":7.9298142421075,"rank":68895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":52139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139559,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5110,"mean":9.2570225092973,"rank":3509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5110,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250,"mean":10.055510040161,"rank":190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
