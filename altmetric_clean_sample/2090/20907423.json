However, this study finds that the expression and activation levels of Akt in the mice skin increased with age. Additionally, the expression levels of Pten, p16, p21 and p53 also elevated with increased age. Immuno-fluorescence analysis showed that Akt phosphorylation found in the epidermal cells (with increased levels of NF-\u03baB activation) were also found. In vivo inhibition of AKT activity result in reduced NF-\u03baB activation. Our results suggest that increasing Akt\/ NF-\u03baB is a crucial mediator of skin aging, which can increase the susceptibility of cell transformation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Chen, Haiyan","Wang, Xusheng","Han, Jimin","Fan, Zhimeng","Sadia, Sobia","Zhang, Rongrong","Guo, Yingsheng","Jiang, Yuyang","Wu, Yaojiong"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0178969","first_seen_on":"2017-06-08T10:21:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1496917300,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28591208?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28591208","pubdate":"2017-06-08T22:02:21+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science (PLoS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"AKT and its related molecular feature in aged mice skin","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/akt-related-molecular-feature-aged-mice-skin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":4442572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2320339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241578,"mean":12.503302872376,"rank":133637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":85257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241578,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115157,"mean":10.621321146966,"rank":66881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":36886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115157,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3893,"mean":10.061711202467,"rank":2112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":1519,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3893,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
