During malignant transformation, the metabolism of cells and tissues is altered. Cancer metabolism can be studied using advanced technologies that detect both metabolites and metabolic activities. Identification, characterization, and quantification of metabolites (metabolomics) are important for metabolic analysis and are usually done by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or by mass spectrometry. In contrast to the magnetic resonance imaging that is used to monitor the tumor morphology during progression of the disease and during therapy, in vivo NMR spectroscopy is used to study and monitor tumor metabolism of cells\/tissues by detection of various biochemicals or metabolites involved in various metabolic pathways. Several in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo NMR studies using \u00b9H and (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) nuclei have documented increased levels of total choline containing compounds, phosphomonoesters and phosphodiesters in human breast cancer tissues, which is indicative of altered choline and phospholipid metabolism. These levels get reversed with successful treatment. Another method that increases the sensitivity of substrate detection by using nuclear spin hyperpolarization of (13)C-lableled substrates by dynamic nuclear polarization has revived a great interest in the study of cancer metabolism. This review discusses breast tissue metabolism studied by various NMR\/MRS methods.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef742a83ee09648b51a1","authors":["Jagannathan, Naranamangalam","Sharma, Uma"],"doi":"10.3390\/metabo7020025","first_seen_on":"2017-06-08T09:20:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2218-1989"],"issue":"2","journal":"Metabolites","last_mentioned_on":1496913608,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28590405"],"pmid":"28590405","pubdate":"2017-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"MDPI AG","title":"Breast Tissue Metabolism by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/breast-tissue-metabolism-magnetic-resonance-spectroscopy-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":6326369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1128688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241578,"mean":12.503334746271,"rank":170871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241578,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181,"mean":3.0818555555556,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.8142857142857,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pmarignani\/statuses\/872745044457000961","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20906395],"posted_on":"2017-06-08T09:20:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Paola Marignani","url":"https:\/\/marignanilab.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/892168339195383808\/oULWijjF_normal.jpg","description":"Scientist discovering something new about signalling networks, cancers and neurodegenerative diseases everyday. #MarignaniLab 55%\/55","id_on_source":"pmarignani","tweeter_id":"32908477","geo":{"lt":60.10867,"ln":-113.64258,"country":"CA"},"followers":649},"tweet_id":"872745044457000961"}]}}
