Among commercially available RDTs, CareStart\u2122 Malaria test was found to show reliable results. This study evaluated the performance of CareStart\u2122 Malaria Combo test kit in Northwestern Tigray in Ethiopia.\nBlood samples were collected from 320 malaria-suspected patients at Mayani Hospital in Northwestern Tigray from December 2015 to March 2016. All blood samples were examined using both light microscopy and CareStart\u2122 Malaria HRP2\/pLDH Combo Test kit. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.\nThe overall parasite positivity using light microscopy and CareStart\u2122 RDT was 41 (12.8%) and 43 (13.4%), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of CareStart\u2122 RDT, regardless of species, were found to be 95.4 and 99.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity of CareStart\u2122 RDT for Plasmodium falciparum or mixed infection and non-falciparum malaria parasites was 94.4 and 85.0%, respectively while the specificity was found to be 98.9 and 99.7%, respectively. The agreement between the two test methods was \"excellent\" with a kappa value of 0.92.\nCareStart\u2122 RDT has very good sensitivity and specificity for malaria diagnosis. The test kit also has an excellent agreement with light microscopy. It is therefore useful in resource-limited areas where microscopy is not available.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","authors":["Daniel Getacher Feleke","Shambel Tarko","Haftom Hadush"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12879-017-2503-9","first_seen_on":"2017-06-08T10:08:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1471-2334"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1497273971,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28587600?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12879-017-2503-9"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12879-017-2503-9?site=bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28587600","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tropical Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"399","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Performance comparison of CareStart\u2122 HRP2\/pLDH combo rapid malaria test with light microscopy in north-western Tigray, Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/performance-comparison-carestart-hrp2pldh-combo-rapid-malaria-test-light-microscopy-northwestern-tig"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":6340122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1132648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242369,"mean":12.570958344336,"rank":171536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242369,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3727,"mean":3.908344605475,"rank":2737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3727,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":5.5627326732673,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
