Previous studies in patients after HTX detected advantageous effects regarding renal function of a tacrolimus (TAC)-based vs cyclosporine-A (CSA)-based immunosuppression (in combination with mycophenolate mofetil). However, data regarding renal function after HTX in mTOR\/CNI patients remain limited.\nPrimary end point of the present study was to analyze renal function in HTX patients 1 year after switch to an mTOR\/CNI-based immunosuppression.\nData of 80 HTX patients after change to mTOR\/CNI-based immunosuppression were retrospectively analyzed. Renal function was assessed by measured serum creatinine and by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated from Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation.\nTwenty-nine patients received mTOR\/CSA-based treatment and 51 patients received mTOR\/TAC-based therapy. At time of switch and at 1-year follow-up, serum creatinine and eGFR did not differ significantly between both study groups (all P=not statistically significant). Analysis of variances with repeated measurements detected a similar change of renal function in both study groups.\nThe present study detected no significant differences between both mTOR\/CNI study groups, indicating a steady state of renal function in HTX patients after switch of immunosuppressive regimen.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbff","authors":["Matthias Helmschrott","Rasmus Rivinius","Thomas Bruckner","Hugo A Katus","Andreas O Doesch"],"doi":"10.2147\/dddt.s135503","first_seen_on":"2017-06-08T01:41:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1177-8881"],"journal":"Drug Design, Development and Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1496886095,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/renal-function-in-heart-transplant-patients-after-switch-to-combined-m-peer-reviewed-article-DDDT"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=36850","pmcid":"PMC5472407","pmid":"28652705","pubdate":"2017-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Renal function in heart transplant patients after switch to combined mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor and calcineurin inhibitor therapy","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/renal-function-heart-transplant-patients-after-switch-combined-mammalian-target-rapamycin-inhibitor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":6326367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1128674,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241578,"mean":12.503436991104,"rank":170875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241578,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1052,"mean":3.7707897240723,"rank":565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1052,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":1.5737142857143,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
