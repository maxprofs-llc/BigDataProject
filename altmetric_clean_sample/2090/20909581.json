The intervention was guided by a self-transformative model of PYD (Eichas, Meca, Montgomery, & Kurtines, 2014). This model proposes that the actions youth take to define themselves function as active ingredients in positive development over the life course. Consistent with the self-transformative model, results provided support for direct or mediated intervention effects on the self-transformative processes of self-construction and self-discovery, life goal development, identity synthesis, and internalizing problems. The findings illustrate the utility of using a self-transformative approach to PYD in work with marginalized youth populations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4c93cf058f61000013c","authors":["Eichas, Kyle","Montgomery, Marilyn J.","Meca, Alan","Kurtines, William M."],"doi":"10.1111\/cdev.12866","first_seen_on":"2017-06-08T12:47:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0009-3920","1467-8624"],"journal":"Child Development","last_mentioned_on":1496941638,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cdev.12866\/abstract;jsessionid=CF595C40A886FCFC003C526702DD77AB.f04t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cdev.12866\/pdf","pmid":"28594072","pubdate":"2017-06-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Empowering Marginalized Youth: A Self-Transformative Intervention for Promoting Positive Youth Development","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/empowering-marginalized-youth-selftransformative-intervention-promoting-positive-youth-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.2,"score_history":{"1y":2.2,"6m":2.2,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":3566026,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4757138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241578,"mean":12.503233536305,"rank":96036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":145019,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241578,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2719,"mean":14.303509933775,"rank":2159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2719,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":62.165909090909,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
