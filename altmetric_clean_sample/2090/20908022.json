The halotolerant algae Dunaliella salina is a good single-cell model for studying plant adaptation to high salinity. To investigate the molecular adaptation mechanism in salinity shock-induced palmella formation, we performed a comprehensive physiological, proteomics and phosphoproteomics study upon palmella formation of D. salina using dimethyl labeling and Ti(4+)-immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) proteomic approaches. We found that 151 salinity-responsive proteins and 35 salinity-responsive phosphoproteins were involved in multiple signaling and metabolic pathways upon palmella formation. Taken together with photosynthetic parameters and enzyme activity analyses, the patterns of protein accumulation and phosphorylation level exhibited the mechanisms upon palmella formation, including dynamics of cytoskeleton and cell membrane curvature, accumulation and transport of exopolysaccharides, photosynthesis and energy supplying (i.e., photosystem II stability and activity, cyclic electron transport, and C4 pathway), nuclear\/chloroplastic gene expression regulation and protein processing, reactive oxygen species homeostasis, and salt signaling transduction. The salinity-responsive protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks implied that signaling and protein synthesis and fate are crucial for modulation of these processes. Importantly, the 3D structure of phosphoprotein clearly indicated that the phosphorylation sites of eight proteins were localized in the region of function domain.","altmetric_jid":"52f8bc933cf058d4628b456f","authors":["Sijia Wei","Yangyang Bian","Qi Zhao","Sixue Chen","Jiawei Mao","Chunxia Song","Kai Cheng","Zhen Xiao","Chuanfang Zhang","Weimin Ma","Hanfa Zou","Mingliang Ye","Shaojun Dai"],"doi":"10.3389\/fpls.2017.00810","first_seen_on":"2017-06-08T11:05:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1664-462X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Plant Science","last_mentioned_on":1496927008,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28588593?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28588593?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5441111","pmid":"28588593","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Salinity-Induced Palmella Formation Mechanism in Halotolerant Algae Dunaliella salina Revealed by Quantitative Proteomics and Phosphoproteomics","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/salinityinduced-palmella-formation-mechanism-halotolerant-algae-dunaliella-salina-revealed-quantitat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":6326363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1128692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241579,"mean":12.503228969525,"rank":170868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241579,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5752,"mean":2.6078295948531,"rank":3501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":1634,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5752,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271,"mean":3.6760074074074,"rank":215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
