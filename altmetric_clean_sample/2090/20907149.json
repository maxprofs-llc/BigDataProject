We argue for feasibility, based on in silico analysis of existing single-cell data and cancer CN profiles. Sampling procedures from existing diploid single cells can render data for a cell with any given profile. Sampling from multiple published tumor profiles can interrogate cancer clonality via an algorithm that tests the multiplicity of close pairwise similarities among single-cell cancer genomes. The majority of common solid cancers would be detectable in this manner. As any early detection method must be verifiable and actionable, we describe how further analysis of suspect cells can aid in determining risk and anatomic origin. Future affordability rests on currently available procedures for tumor cell enrichment and inexpensive methods for single-cell analysis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036b0","authors":["Alexander Krasnitz","Jude Kendall","Joan Alexander","Dan Levy","Michael Wigler"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.molmed.2017.05.005","first_seen_on":"2017-06-08T10:09:32+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"handles":[],"issns":["14714914","1471-499X"],"journal":"Trends in Molecular Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1505726599,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28587830?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/trends\/molecular-medicine\/fulltext\/S1471-4914%2817%2930083-7#.WT1n15pv-I0.twitter","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/trends\/molecular-medicine\/fulltext\/S1471-4914(17)30083-7","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1471491417300837"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S1471491417300837\/pdf","pmid":"28587830","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Early Detection of Cancer in Blood Using Single-Cell Analysis: A Proposal","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/early-detection-cancer-blood-using-singlecell-analysis-proposal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.35,"score_history":{"1y":5.35,"6m":5.35,"3m":1,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":1568776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6855579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245516,"mean":12.674715638555,"rank":60834,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":184418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245516,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":716,"mean":7.2918293706294,"rank":167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":716,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":18.0555,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
