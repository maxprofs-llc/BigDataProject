Variations in incidence rates, resection rates, and type of surgical resection were compared by sex, age group, neighborhood income, community population, health region, and physician specialty.\nIncidence rates per 100\u00a0000 vary significantly by sex, age, neighborhood income, and community size. Women, the elderly (75+ years), those in the higher income quintiles, and those living in larger communities were significantly less likely to receive a laryngectomy procedure.\nLaryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer incidence rates vary by sex, age, neighborhood income, community size, and health region. Resection rates vary by age, sex, and health region. These disparities warrant further evaluation to improve the quality of delivered care in Ontario.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f6100075df","authors":["Eskander, Antoine","Mifsud, Matthew","Irish, Jonathan","Gullane, Patrick","Gilbert, Ralph","Brown, Dale","de Almeida, John R.","Urbach, David R.","Goldstein, David P."],"doi":"10.1002\/hed.24787","first_seen_on":"2017-06-08T09:28:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1043-3074","1097-0347"],"journal":"Head & Neck","last_mentioned_on":1496914072,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/hed.24787\/abstract;jsessionid=18E311ACEC495E83861F929F83D18855.f04t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/hed.24787\/pdf","pmid":"28593742","pubdate":"2017-06-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","generalsurgery"],"title":"Overview of surgery for laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer in Ontario, 2003-2010","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.85,"score_history":{"1y":0.85,"6m":0.85,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":6016325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2308266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241578,"mean":12.503324604577,"rank":156325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":85016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241578,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1390,"mean":2.3491835853132,"rank":839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1390,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":2.3256097560976,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrTonyEskander\/statuses\/872746990962081793","license":"gnip","rt":["AHNSinfo"],"citation_ids":[20906482],"posted_on":"2017-06-08T09:27:52+00:00","author":{"name":"Antoine Eskander","url":"https:\/\/www.ices.on.ca\/About-ICES\/ICES-Scientists\/E\/Antoine-Eskander","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/900427917271994368\/0aQYLuNd_normal.jpg","description":"Husband, Dad, \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6Head&NeckOnc\/Recon @Sunnybrook.
