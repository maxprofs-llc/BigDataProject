But that is not the whole story. It is also important that the development and implementation of the intervention be evaluated. All three phases (development, implementation, and effectiveness) are central to a model of intervention research proposed by the National Occupational Research Agenda Intervention Effectiveness Research team. Areas for future research are also presented.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e91","authors":["Linda M. Goldenhar","Anthony D.
