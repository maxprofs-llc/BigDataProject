A distinction, however, is that RET\/PTCs induce immunostimulatory programs, suggesting that, in the case of this tumor type, the additional pro-inflammatory pathway reduces aggressiveness. Here, we demonstrate that pro-inflammatory programs are selectively activated by TRAF2 and TRAF6 association with RET\/PTC oncoproteins. Eliminating this mechanism reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production without decreasing transformation efficiency. Conversely, ablating MEK\/ERK or PI3K\/AKT signaling eliminates transformation but not pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Functional uncoupling of the two pathways demonstrates that intrinsic pro-inflammatory pathways are not required for cellular transformation and suggests a need for further investigation into the role inflammation plays in thyroid tumor progression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m111.322677","first_seen_on":"2012-02-07T20:07:29+00:00","funders":["niaid","phs"],"issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1328595303,"links":["http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/287\/6\/3691.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/287\/6\/3691.full.pdf","pmid":"22158616","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Identification of Functionally Distinct TRAF Proinflammatory and Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase\/Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase\/Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase Kinase (PI3K\/MEK) Transforming Activities Emanating from RET\/PTC Fusion Oncoprotein","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-functionally-distinct-traf-proinflammatory-phosphatidylinositol-3kinasemitogenactivat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630815,"mean":4.9285062716012,"rank":2899135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630815,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230893,"mean":3.9593402369942,"rank":166769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230893,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28043,"mean":2.63918222666,"rank":24474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":1800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28043,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1193,"mean":1.5275704697987,"rank":854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1193,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
