Optimization of the series has led to the discovery of 29, which has oral activity in a rat inflammatory pain model and limited brain exposure at analgesic doses, consistent with a lower risk of CNS-mediated tolerability issues.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f2","authors":["Cheng YX","Pourashraf M","Luo X","Srivastava S","Walpole C","Salois D","St-Onge S","Payza K","Lessard E","Yu XH","Tomaszewski MJ"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmcl.2011.12.124","first_seen_on":"2012-02-10T07:34:07+00:00","issns":["0960-894X"],"issue":"","journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters","last_mentioned_on":1328857767,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22284817?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22284817"],"pmid":"22284817","pubdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"\u03b3-Carbolines: A novel class of cannabinoid agonists with high aqueous solubility and restricted CNS penetration.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/%CE%B3carbolines-novel-class-cannabinoid-agonists-high-aqueous-solubility-restricted-cns-penetration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7321362,"mean":6.3757771078313,"rank":5531791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":994431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7321362,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246208,"mean":4.8824238222311,"rank":158240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":43243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246208,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1948,"mean":2.6198140729327,"rank":1201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1948,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":0.88253968253968,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
