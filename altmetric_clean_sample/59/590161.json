Using herbicide resistant lettuce to manufacture oral Hepatitis B vaccines? #gmo #gmos"],"citation":{"abstract":"Efficient immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and other pathogens with plant-based oral vaccines requires appropriate plant expressors and the optimization of vaccine compositions and administration protocols. Previous immunization studies were mainly based on a combination of the injection of a small surface antigen of HBV (S-HBsAg) and the feeding with raw tissue containing the antigen, supplemented with an adjuvant, and coming from plants conferring resistance to kanamycin. The objective of this study was to develop a prototype oral vaccine formula suitable for human immunization. Herbicide-resistant lettuce was engineered, stably expressing through progeny generation micrograms of S-HBsAg per g of fresh weight and formed into virus-like particles (VLPs). Lyophilized tissue containing a relatively low, 100-ng VLP-assembled antigen dose, administered only orally to mice with a long, 60-day interval between prime and boost immunizations and without exogenous adjuvant, elicited mucosal and systemic humoral anti-HBs responses at the nominally protective level. Lyophilized tissue was converted into tablets, which preserved S-HBsAg content for at least one year of room temperature storage. The results of the study provide indications on immunization methodology using a durable, efficacious, and convenient plant-derived prototype oral vaccine against hepatitis B.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b6a","authors":["Tomasz Pniewski","J\u00f3zef Kapusta","Piotr Boci\u0105g","Jacek Wojciechowicz","Anna Kostrzak","Micha\u0142 Gdula","Olga Fedorowicz-Stro\u0144ska","Piotr W\u00f3jcik","Halina Otta","S\u0142awomir Samardakiewicz","Bogdan Wolko","Andrzej P\u0142ucienniczak"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13353-010-0001-5","first_seen_on":"2012-02-04T21:40:03+00:00","issns":["1234-1983"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Applied Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1328391069,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3088802\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3088802","pmid":"21107787","pubdate":"2011-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"125","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Low-dose oral immunization with lyophilized tissue of herbicide-resistant lettuce expressing hepatitis B surface antigen for prototype plant-derived vaccine tablet formulation","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lowdose-oral-immunization-lyophilized-tissue-herbicideresistant-lettuce-expressing-hepatitis-b-surfa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627324,"mean":4.9493148749129,"rank":2018414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":932239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627324,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230598,"mean":4.0119506324889,"rank":101235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":87873,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230598,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":2.6930169491525,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
