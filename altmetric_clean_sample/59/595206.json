Based on these reports, we developed an inpatient combination protocol of these two modalities for the treatment of such patients. The aims of this pilot study were to confirm the safety and feasibility of the protocol in a large number of patients from different institutions, and identify predictors of the clinical response to the treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000085b","authors":["Wataru Kakuda","Wataru Kakuda","Masahiro Abo","Masato Shimizu","Jinichi Sasanuma","Takatsugu Okamoto","Aki Yokoi","Kensuke Taguchi","Sugao Mitani","Hiroaki Harashima","Naoki Urushidani","Mitsuyoshi Urashima"],"doi":"10.1186\/1743-0003-9-4","first_seen_on":"2012-02-08T16:34:33+00:00","issns":["","1743-0003"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1385451685,"links":["http:\/\/www.jneuroengrehab.com\/content\/9\/1\/4\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1743-0003-9-4.pdf"],"pmid":"22264239","pubdate":"2012-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"4","subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine","biomedicalengineering","neurology"],"title":"A multi-center study on low-frequency rTMS combined with intensive occupational therapy for upper limb hemiparesis in post-stroke patients","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multicenter-study-lowfrequency-rtms-combined-intensive-occupational-therapy-upper-limb-hemiparesis-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628714,"mean":4.9390391673343,"rank":1688313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":1914830,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628714,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230187,"mean":3.9820058648226,"rank":73101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":154350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230187,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282,"mean":3.092975088968,"rank":131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.2722222222222,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
