This study describes the outcome in 164 pregnant women with HD (158 deliveries in women in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classes 1 and 2; 17 in NYHA Classes 3 and 4) who received good antenatal care and benefitted from a specific protocol and experience of a dedicated staff. There were no maternal or neonatal deaths; 46 women were diagnosed peripartum. Based on a sub-division into NYHA categories, and when sub-divided by HD, there were no statistically significant differences between groups with regard to maternal age, gestational age at admission or at delivery, birth weight, 5 min Apgar scores, mode of delivery (caesarean delivery), senior obstetric\/anaesthesiology staff in attendance or delivery during day\/working hours. There was a higher incidence of pre-term deliveries in women with rheumatic heart disease and Marfan syndrome (p = 0.06) relative to others. Babies of women with coronary heart disease had prolonged postpartum course in the NICU (p = 0.0001) and longer total hospital stays for the mother. In conclusion, well-managed, motivated mothers with HD who benefit from comprehensive antenatal care, and are managed primarily by their obstetric and anaesthesia teams, can aspire to a good outcome for themselves and their babies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f610004084","authors":["Michaelson-Cohen R","Elstein D","Ioscovich A","Armon S","Schimmel MS","Butnaru A","Samueloff A","Grisaru-Granovsky S"],"doi":"10.3109\/01443615.2011.603064","first_seen_on":"2012-02-09T12:41:30+00:00","issns":["0144-3615"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology","last_mentioned_on":1328790369,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21973131?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21973131","pubdate":"2011-10-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Severe heart disease complicating pregnancy does not preclude a favourable pregnancy outcome: 15 years' experience in a single centre.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/severe-heart-disease-complicating-pregnancy-not-preclude-favourable-pregnancy-outcome-15-years-exper"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619418,"mean":4.9283821178971,"rank":2903684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619418,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230150,"mean":4.0061852278308,"rank":167912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230150,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":329,"mean":2.9167134146341,"rank":243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":329,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.1944444444444,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Psychology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"NZ":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/AnestesiaF\/status\/167585070373273601","citation_ids":[596562],"posted_on":"2012-02-09T12:26:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
