These learning principles have proven relevant and applicable to a wide range of learning situations in a variety of settings, and can be useful in supporting medical education. They can provide guidance to medical students for efficient and effective study, and can be helpful to faculty to support instructional planning and decisions relating to curriculum.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041e4","authors":["Maris F.
