Plant derived anti-angiogenic molecules acting via VEGF are being investigated for curtailing angiogenesis dependent diseases. In this study, methanolic (CM), n-hexane (CH), ethylacetate (CE) and water (CW) extracts of the roots of Calotropis procera were tested for anti-angiogenic activity. In the chicken egg chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, CM, CH and CE but not CW inhibited VEGF-induced neovascularization in a dose-dependent manner. Of all the tested extracts, CM at the dose of 10, 5 and 2.5 ng most effectively inhibited over 83, 71 and 64%, of neovascularization induced by 10ng of VEGF, respectively. Sponge implantation assay in mice further showed that at the dose of 100ng CM, CH and CE but not CW significantly inhibited neovascularization induced by VEGF (100 ng). Taken together, this study indicates that the root extracts of C. procera may possess anti-angiogenic activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000cf06","first_seen_on":"2012-02-10T12:34:46+00:00","issns":["0019-5499"],"issue":"1","journal":"Indian journal of physiology and pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1328876851,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22315805?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22315805","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology","pharmacology"],"title":"Calotropis procera root extracts block VEGF-induced angiogenesis: quantitative analysis.","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/calotropis-procera-root-extracts-block-vegfinduced-angiogenesis-quantitative-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":4206817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237385,"mean":4.5424961833993,"rank":194309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237385,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":4.5787521367521,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.90625,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/VEGFRSSfeeds\/status\/167947803774042113","citation_ids":[598318],"posted_on":"2012-02-10T12:27:31+00:00","author":{"name":"VEGF RSS Feeds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516588600\/VEGF_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"VEGFRSSfeeds","tweeter_id":"88511740","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":363},"tweet_id":"167947803774042113"}]}}
