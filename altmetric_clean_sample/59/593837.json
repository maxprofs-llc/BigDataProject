Online referral directories listing e-mail addresses of UK homeopaths, chiropractors and general practitioners and private websites were visited. All addresses thus located received a letter of a (fictitious) patient asking for advice about the MMR vaccination. After sending a follow-up letter explaining the nature and aim of this project and offering the option of withdrawal, 26% of all respondents withdrew their answers. Homeopaths yielded a final response rate (53%, n = 77) compared to chiropractors (32%, n = 16). GPs unanimously refused to give advice over the Internet. No homeopath and only one chiropractor advised in favour of the MMR vaccination. Two homeopaths and three chiropractors indirectly advised in favour of MMR. More chiropractors than homeopaths displayed a positive attitude towards the MMR vaccination. Some complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers have a negative attitude towards immunisation and means of changing this should be considered.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ea","authors":["Katja Schmidt","Edzard Ernst","Schmidt, Katja","Ernst, Edzard"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0264-410x(02)00628-x","endpage":"1047","first_seen_on":"2012-02-07T20:50:19+00:00","issns":["0264-410X","0264410X"],"issue":"11-12","journal":"Vaccine","last_mentioned_on":1500303048,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12559777","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/12559777\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0264-410X(02)00628-X","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12559777"],"pmid":"12559777","pubdate":"2003-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1044","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"MMR vaccination advice over the Internet","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mmr-vaccination-advice-internet"},"altmetric_score":{"score":38.8,"score_history":{"1y":1.35,"6m":1.35,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":38.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355417,"mean":7.0462862311029,"rank":238354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8117031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355417,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251951,"mean":5.2407872117486,"rank":5128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":246820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251951,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5605,"mean":7.7071630977873,"rank":154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":5451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5605,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":6.08444,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":16,"researcher":3,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":16,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
