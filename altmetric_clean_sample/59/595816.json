They are similar at the cell differentiation level, sometimes making difficult to distinguish them from other indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas. To better characterize their genetic basis, we performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization in 101 marginal zone lymphomas (46 MALT, 35 splenic and 20 nodal marginal zone lymphomas) and 13 lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas. Overall, 90% exhibited copy-number abnormalities. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas demonstrated the most complex karyotype (median=7 copy-number abnormalities), followed by MALT (4), nodal (3.5) and splenic marginal zone lymphomas (3). A comparative analysis exposed a group of copy-number abnormalities shared by several or all the entities with few disease-specific abnormalities. Gain of chromosomes 3, 12 and 18 and loss of 6q23-q24 (TNFAIP3) were identified in all entities. Losses of 13q14.3 (MIRN15A-MIRN16-1) and 17p13.3-p12 (TP53) were found in lymphoplasmacytic and splenic marginal zone lymphomas; loss of 11q21-q22 (ATM) was found in nodal, splenic marginal zone and lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas and loss of 7q32.1-q33 was found in MALT, splenic and lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas. Abnormalities affecting the nuclear factor kappa B pathway were observed in 70% of MALT and lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas and 30% of splenic and nodal marginal zone lymphomas, suggesting distinct roles of this pathway in the pathogenesis\/progression of these subtypes. Elucidation of the genetic alterations contributing to the pathogenesis of these lymphomas may guide to design-specific therapeutic approaches.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008eb7","authors":["Esteban Braggio","Ahmet Dogan","Jonathan J Keats","Wee J Chng","Gaofeng Huang","Julie M Matthews","Matthew J Maurer","Mark E Law","David S Bosler","Michael Barrett","Izidore S Lossos","Thomas E Witzig","Rafael Fonseca","Braggio E","Dogan A","Keats JJ","Chng WJ","Huang G","Matthews JM","Maurer MJ","Law ME","Bosler DS","Barrett M","Lossos IS","Witzig TE","Fonseca R"],"doi":"10.1038\/modpathol.2011.213","endpage":"660","first_seen_on":"2012-02-09T00:41:29+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["0893-3952","1530-0285"],"issue":"5","journal":"Modern Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1328747255,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/modpathol\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/modpathol2011213a.html"],"pmid":"22301699","pubdate":"2012-02-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"651","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Genomic analysis of marginal zone and lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas identified common and disease-specific abnormalities","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomic-analysis-marginal-zone-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphomas-identified-common-diseasespecific-abnorma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627970,"mean":4.9447382433571,"rank":2904922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627970,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230253,"mean":3.9958956100275,"rank":167367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230253,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":749,"mean":2.7251764705882,"rank":604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":749,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":0.85238095238095,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
