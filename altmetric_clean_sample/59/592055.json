(via #pubmedontap)"],"citation":{"abstract":"Local adipofascial turn-over flaps with skin grafts were successfully used to reconstruct complicated skin defects over the dorsum of the foot in 7 patients. The blood supply of the flap comes from perforators in the base and from the surrounding subcutaneous and fascial plexuses. A new concept of base-to-flap area ratio is proposed to predict the survival of the turn-over flaps in addition to the conventional base-to-length ratio. This appears to be a valuable technique for difficult wounds of the dorsum of the foot.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006d16","authors":["Lai, C S","Lin, S D","Yang, C C","Chou, C K"],"first_seen_on":"2012-02-07T00:29:47+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0007-1226"],"issue":"3","journal":"British Journal of Plastic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1328545466,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1673868?dopt=Citation"],"pmid":"1673868","pubdate":"1991-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Adipofascial turn-over flap for reconstruction of the dorsum of the foot.","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adipofascial-turnover-flap-reconstruction-dorsum-foot"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":2325780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1540518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234201,"mean":4.2436846968405,"rank":102073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":96136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234201,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":2.4769113924051,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"KR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/minbom_guim\/status\/166557875374784513","citation_ids":[592055],"posted_on":"2012-02-06T16:24:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Min Bom","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1370565556\/image_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"minbom_guim","tweeter_id":"305657907","followers":43},"tweet_id":"166557875374784513"}]}}
