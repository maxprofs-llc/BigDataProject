It occurs in a subset of laboring women after epidural administration and is noninfectious in origin. Epidural fever is not associated with neonatal sepsis, but it often is difficult to distinguish from chorioamnionitis, a condition that can cause neonatal sepsis. Because of this, neonates born to mothers who experience fever during labor are often evaluated for sepsis. Potential solutions to this problem include establishing better methods to distinguish between epidural fever and chorioamnionitis and making alternative methods of pain relief available to laboring women.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ec3cf058f610005d6d","authors":["Shatken, Sarit","Greenough, Kaitlyn","McPherson, Christina"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1542-2011.2011.00105.x","endpage":"85","first_seen_on":"2012-02-10T14:18:12+00:00","issns":["1542-2011","1526-9523"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Midwifery & Women's Health","last_mentioned_on":1328882439,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1542-2011.2011.00105.x\/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+4+Feb+from+10-12+GMT+for+monthly+maintenance"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1542-2011.2011.00105.x\/pdf","pmid":"22251917","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"82","subjects":["nursing","obstetrics"],"title":"Epidural Fever and Its Implications for Mothers and Neonates: Taking the Heat","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epidural-fever-implications-mothers-neonates-taking-heat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3084197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":968619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233996,"mean":4.2842599970088,"rank":147214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":50242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233996,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":500,"mean":4.0278316633267,"rank":362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":500,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":3.034693877551,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Social Sciences":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":3,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"TR":1,"MX":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/birthingnatural\/status\/167971240512978944","citation_ids":[598441],"posted_on":"2012-02-10T14:00:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Birthing Naturally","url":"http:\/\/www.birthingnaturally.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/635448602190565377\/s3n7c-tX_normal.jpg","description":"Links to newly released research relating to pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum for professionals and families.","id_on_source":"birthingnatural","tweeter_id":"124858132","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":695},"tweet_id":"167971240512978944"}]}}
