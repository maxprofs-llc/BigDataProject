We examined whether the function of central pathways influencing sympathetic activity is altered in conscious rabbits given a low dose of AngII that produces a modest hypertension and, therefore, limited secondary complications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a49","authors":["Moretti JL","Burke SL","Davern PJ","Evans RG","Lambert GW","Head GA"],"doi":"10.1097\/hjh.0b013e328350133a","endpage":"560","first_seen_on":"2012-02-07T20:10:24+00:00","issns":["0263-6352"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Hypertension","last_mentioned_on":1328140800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22252481","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/HJH.0b013e328350133a"],"pmid":"22252481","pubdate":"2012-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"551","title":"Renal sympathetic activation from long-term low-dose angiotensin II infusion in rabbits.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/renal-sympathetic-activation-longterm-lowdose-angiotensin-ii-infusion-rabbits"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631967,"mean":4.9253635474614,"rank":2015270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":944673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631967,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230894,"mean":3.9554695898103,"rank":100660,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230894,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1490,"mean":2.2425198119543,"rank":589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1490,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":1.3228571428571,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
