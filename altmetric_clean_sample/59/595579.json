Delayed bleeding after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for gastric epithelial neoplasms is a major complication. We investigated factors related to post-ESD bleeding to identify preventive measures. Methods. The study included 161 gastric epithelial neoplasms in 142 patients from June 2007 to September 2010. Post-ESD bleeding was defined as an ulcer with active bleeding or apparent exposed vessels diagnosed by an emergency endoscopy or a planned follow-up endoscopy. We analyzed associations between bleeding and the following factors: age, sex, morphology, pathology, tumor depth, ulcer presence\/absence, location, size of the resected lesion, duration of the procedure, the number of times bleeding occurred during ESD, and the use of anticoagulants and\/or antiplatelet drugs. Subsequently, we examined characteristics of bleeding cases. Results. Post-ESD bleeding occurred in 21 lesions. Univariate analysis of these cases showed that ulcer presence\/absence (P < 0.001), middle or lower third lesions (P = 0.036), circumference (P = 0.014), and a post-ESD ulcer with an extended lesser curve (P = 0.009) were significant predictors of bleeding. Multivariate analysis showed that ulcer presence\/absence (OR 9.73, 95% CI 2.28-41.53) was the only significant predictor. Conclusion. Ulcer presence\/absence was considered the most significant predictor of post-ESD bleeding.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5253cf058f610003caf","authors":["Nakanishi, Toshio"],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/875323","first_seen_on":"2012-02-08T21:09:36+00:00","issns":["1687-6121"],"journal":"Gastroenterology Research & Practice","last_mentioned_on":1328735101,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/grp\/2012\/875323\/","http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/grp\/2012\/875323\/abs\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/grp\/2012\/875323.pdf","pmid":"22536221","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Analysis of Delayed Bleeding after Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Gastric Epithelial Neoplasms","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-delayed-bleeding-after-endoscopic-submucosal-dissection-gastric-epithelial-neoplasms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":3557759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":831125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236886,"mean":4.5328649091334,"rank":148234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236886,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280,"mean":2.5474480286738,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":1.6074074074074,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
