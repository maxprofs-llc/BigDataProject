These sampling methods often produce violations of the assumption of data independence that most traditional statistics share. Hierarchical linear modeling is a statistical method that can overcome violations of the independence assumption and lead to correct analysis of data, yet it is rarely used in nutrition research. The purpose of this viewpoint is to illustrate the benefits of hierarchical linear modeling within a nutrition research context.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000cb1","authors":["Russell T.
