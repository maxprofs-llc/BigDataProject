The pH titrations indicate that Probe displays a remarkable emission enhancement with a pKa of 2.73 and responds linearly to minor pH fluctuations within the extremely acidic range of 2.21-3.30. Interestingly, Probe also exhibits strong pH-dependent characteristics with pKa 11.28 and linear response to extreme-alkalinity range of 10.41-12.43. In addition, Probe shows a large Stokes shift of 84\u00a0nm under extremely acidic and alkaline conditions, high selectivity, excellent sensitivity, good water-solubility and fine stability, all of which are favorable for intracellular pH imaging. The probe is further successfully applied to image extremely acidic and alkaline pH values fluctuations in E.\u00a0coli cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002249","authors":["Jian-Bin Chao","Hui-Juan Wang","Yong-Bin Zhang","Zhi-Qing Li","Yu-Hong Liu","Fang-Jun Huo","Cai-Xia Yin","Ya-Wei Shi","Juan-Juan Wang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aca.2017.04.020","first_seen_on":"2017-05-30T10:43:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00032670","1873-4324"],"journal":"Analytica Chimica Acta","last_mentioned_on":1496140975,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28552306?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28552306","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"A single pH fluorescent probe for biosensing and imaging of extreme acidity and extreme alkalinity","type":"article","volume":"975","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/single-ph-fluorescent-probe-biosensing-imaging-extreme-acidity-extreme-alkalinity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":7168838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240041,"mean":12.029790893184,"rank":195183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240041,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1826,"mean":2.0037293150685,"rank":1574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1826,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":2.4833164556962,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BiosensorPapers\/statuses\/869504387948756993","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20696217],"posted_on":"2017-05-30T10:42:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Biosensor Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/706647650213363712\/BpK5-z3e_normal.jpg","description":"Pubmed Twitterbot for #biosensor papers.
