This fact highlights the need to search for potential drug targets that can reduce stroke-related brain damage. We showed recently that a glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) inhibitor attenuates tissue plasminogen activator-induced hemorrhagic transformation after permanent focal cerebral ischemia. Here, we examined whether GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition mitigates early ischemia-reperfusion stroke injury and investigated its potential mechanism of action. We used the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model to mimic transient cerebral ischemia. At 3.5 h after MCAO, cerebral blood flow was restored, and rats were administered DMSO (vehicle, 1% in saline) or GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor TWS119 (30 mg\/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. Animals were sacrificed 24 h after MCAO. TWS119 treatment reduced neurologic deficits, brain edema, infarct volume, and blood-brain barrier permeability compared with those in the vehicle group. TWS119 treatment also increased the protein expression of \u03b2-catenin and zonula occludens-1 but decreased \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation while suppressing the expression of GSK-3\u03b2. These results indicate that GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition protects the blood-brain barrier and attenuates early ischemia-reperfusion stroke injury. This protection may be related to early activation of the Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007947","authors":["Wei Wang","Mingchang Li","Yuefei Wang","Zhongyu Wang","Wei Zhang","Fangxia Guan","Qianxue Chen","Jian Wang"],"doi":"10.7150\/ijms.17514","first_seen_on":"2017-05-30T10:20:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1449-1907"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1505049660,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28553165?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5436475","pmid":"28553165","pubdate":"2017-05-30T22:02:37+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"GSK-3\u03b2 as a target for protection against transient cerebral ischemia","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gsk3%CE%B2-target-protection-against-transient-cerebral-ischemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":3.25,"6m":3.25,"3m":3,"1m":3,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392422,"mean":7.0682902969164,"rank":2071396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6280932,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392422,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244612,"mean":12.545650506314,"rank":78585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":165067,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244612,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311,"mean":3.1131935483871,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.6353846153846,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
