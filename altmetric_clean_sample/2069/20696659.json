Methods Using a prospective, randomised, blinded design, 40 client-owned adult cats were assigned to receive IM dexmedetomidine (10 \u00b5g\/kg) combined with either butorphanol (0.4 mg\/kg) ('BUT' group) or buprenorphine (20 \u00b5g\/kg) ('BUP' group). Sedation was scored using a previously published multidimensional composite scale before administration (T0) and 5, 10, 15 and 20 mins afterwards (T5, T10, T15 and T20, respectively). Alfaxalone (1.5 mg\/kg) was administered IM at T20 if the cat was not deemed adequately sedated to place an intravenous catheter. Adverse events were recorded. Friedman two-way ANOVA analysed sedation scores within groups. Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test compared sedation scores between groups; Fisher's exact test analysed the frequency of alfaxalone administration and adverse events. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Sedation scores between groups were similar at baseline, but at T5, T10, T15 and T20 scores were higher in the BUT group ( P <0.01). Within both groups, sedation scores changed over time and the highest sedation scores were reached at T10. Requirement for additional sedation was similar between groups: two cats in the BUT group and five cats in the BUP group. One cat and 11 cats vomited ( P = 0.002) in the BUT and BUP groups, respectively. No other adverse events were recorded. Conclusions and relevance At these doses, IM buprenorphine-dexmedetomidine provides inferior sedation and a higher incidence of vomiting than butorphanol-dexmedetomidine in cats. Butorphanol-dexmedetomidine may be preferred for feline sedation, especially where vomiting is contraindicated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c7f","authors":["Bhalla, Rebecca J","Trimble, Toby A","Leece, Elizabeth A","Vettorato, Enzo","Rebecca J Bhalla","Toby A Trimble","Elizabeth A Leece","Enzo Vettorato"],"doi":"10.1177\/1098612x17709612","first_seen_on":"2017-05-30T11:15:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-612X","1532-2750"],"journal":"Journal of Feline Medicine & Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1497729979,"links":["http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/1098612X17709612","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28548551"],"pmid":"28548551","publisher":"SAGE Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Comparison of intramuscular butorphanol and buprenorphine combined with dexmedetomidine for sedation in cats","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-intramuscular-butorphanol-buprenorphine-combined-dexmedetomidine-sedation-cats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":1.6,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":3947338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4405058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244357,"mean":12.53759802092,"rank":112092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":130432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244357,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":973,"mean":3.8132469135802,"rank":260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":707,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":973,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":13.382117647059,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":2},"mendeley":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Albinovet\/statuses\/869512439594967040","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20696659],"posted_on":"2017-05-30T11:14:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefano Cattaneo DVM","url":"http:\/\/veterinarialbino.com\/\/twitter_en.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1673372763\/vet_tweet_normal.png","description":"Daily updates about pet health covering the last articles published in veterinary journals.","id_on_source":"Albinovet","tweeter_id":"418669767","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2114},"tweet_id":"869512439594967040"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nachorredondo\/statuses\/875827656889184256","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20696659],"posted_on":"2017-06-16T21:29:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Nacho Redondo","url":"https:\/\/www.uchceu.es\/directorio\/nacho","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507093451138015233\/MhhCiVdL_normal.jpeg","description":"Profesor Agregado de Anestesiolog\u00eda.
