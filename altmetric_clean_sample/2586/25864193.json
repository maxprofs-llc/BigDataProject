This compound, a mixed ester bearing one pivaloyloxymethyl substituent and one 1-naphthyl ester displayed an EC50 of 0.79 nM as a stimulant of T cell proliferation, and a 9.0 nM EC50 in an assay designed to measure interferon gamma production. In both assays, this is the most potent butyrophilin ligand prodrug yet reported, and thus it should be a valuable tool for studies of T cell function. Furthermore, mixed aryl\/acyloxyalkyl esters may represent a new class of phosphonate prodrugs with high efficacy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006815","authors":["Benjamin J.
