If results are similar enough across different administration modalities, then new administration technologies can be used interchangeably and the choice of technology can be based on other factors, such as convenience in the study design. An assessment based on item response theory (IRT), such as the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) depression item bank, offers new possibilities for assessing the effect of technology choice upon results.\nTo create equivalent halves of the PROMIS depression item bank and to use these halves to compare survey responses and user satisfaction among administration modalities-paper, mobile phone, or tablet-with a community mental health care population.\nThe 28 PROMIS depression items were divided into 2 halves based on content and simulations with an established PROMIS response data set. A total of 129 participants were recruited from an outpatient public sector mental health clinic based in Memphis. All participants took both nonoverlapping halves of the PROMIS IRT-based depression items (Part A and Part B): once using paper and pencil, and once using either a mobile phone or tablet. An 8-cell randomization was done on technology used, order of technologies used, and order of PROMIS Parts A and B. Both Parts A and B were administered as fixed-length assessments and both were scored using published PROMIS IRT parameters and algorithms.\nAll 129 participants received either Part A or B via paper assessment. Participants were also administered the opposite assessment, 63 using a mobile phone and 66 using a tablet. There was no significant difference in item response scores for Part A versus B. All 3 of the technologies yielded essentially identical assessment results and equivalent satisfaction levels.\nOur findings show that the PROMIS depression assessment can be divided into 2 equivalent halves, with the potential to simplify future experimental methodologies. Among community mental health care recipients, the PROMIS items function similarly whether administered via paper, tablet, or mobile phone. User satisfaction across modalities was also similar. Because paper, tablet, and mobile phone administrations yielded similar results, the choice of technology should be based on factors such as convenience and can even be changed during a study without adversely affecting the comparability of results.","altmetric_jid":"56b368402a83ee42788b4596","authors":["Benjamin B Brodey"],"doi":"10.2196\/mental.6805","first_seen_on":"2017-09-06T14:30:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2368-7959"],"issue":"3","journal":"JMIR Mental Health","last_mentioned_on":1505416806,"links":["http:\/\/mental.jmir.org\/2017\/3\/e36\/"],"pmid":"28877861","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"JMIR Publications Inc., Toronto, Canada","title":"Assessing the Equivalence of Paper, Mobile Phone, and Tablet Survey Responses at a Community Mental Health Center Using Equivalent Halves of a \u2018Gold-Standard\u2019 Depression Item Bank","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessing-equivalence-paper-mobile-phone-tablet-survey-responses-community-mental-health-center-usin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.45,"score_history":{"1y":4.45,"6m":4.45,"3m":4.45,"1m":4.45,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414430,"mean":7.0825007427048,"rank":1785303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6621589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414430,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140895,"mean":12.157161752807,"rank":35914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":104688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140895,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":27.724140350877,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
