In this study, our goal was to develop the transcriptomic resource of O. oratoria that would support adaptation mechanism studies. We generated the whole transcriptome of O. oratoria from combined tissues (eyestalk, muscle, sexual and viscus) using Hiseq technology. A total of 51,305,284 high-quality clean reads were assembled to produce 59,054 non-redundant transcripts with a mean length of 987nt using Trinity and CORSET software. Among the predictable unigenes, a total of 32,451 unigenes were annotated based on protein databases. Finally, we predicted the coding sequences of 31,822 unigenes and obtained 19,057 SSRs in the present study. The present study will provide an important resource and foundational understanding for future genomic research of O. oratoria.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f6100080c9","authors":["Fangrui Lou","Tianxiang Gao","Shanshan Cai","Zhiqiang Han"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.margen.2017.08.003","first_seen_on":"2017-09-06T14:44:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["18747787","1876-7478"],"journal":"Marine Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1504713652,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28870633?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28870633"],"pmid":"28870633","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","genetics"],"title":"De novo assembly and annotation of the whole transcriptome of Oratosquilla oratoria","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8373007,"mean":7.0576589951014,"rank":6353917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1135123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8373007,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120348,"mean":12.074399328608,"rank":84201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":22554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120348,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258,"mean":2.0645369649805,"rank":171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":3.7293333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/adapmolevol\/statuses\/905441470319968256","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24863386],"posted_on":"2017-09-06T14:44:03+00:00","author":{"name":"AdapMolEvol papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/854679688081440769\/UfDEVIxi_normal.jpg","description":"Feed for adaptive molecular evolution papers.","id_on_source":"adapmolevol","tweeter_id":"846710014102392835","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":27},"tweet_id":"905441470319968256"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/transcriptomes\/statuses\/905460801758048258","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24863386],"posted_on":"2017-09-06T16:00:52+00:00","author":{"name":"Transcriptomes","url":"http:\/\/davetang.org\/muse\/2015\/01\/31\/transcriptome-feed-using-r\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/561190761790574593\/2j6U4lnz_normal.png","description":"A transcriptome feed made using #Rstats.
