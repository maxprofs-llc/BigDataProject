In this work, the authors show lipid bilayer formation on plasma activated gold surfaces in physiological conditions without any other modification if at least 30% positively charged lipids are present. Details of bilayer formation from small unilamellar vesicles were monitored using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation in both basic and acidic environment. The authors also confirmed that this positively charged bilayer system can sustain primary cortical neuron growth and lipid transfer. This method will provide simple means to construct biomimetic interface on gold electrodes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5693cf058f610004b26","authors":["Sung-Eun Choi","Kyrylo Greben","Roger W\u00f6rdenweber","Andreas Offenh\u00e4usser"],"doi":"10.1116\/1.4945306","first_seen_on":"2016-06-03T02:24:30+00:00","issns":["1559-4106","1934-8630"],"issue":"2","journal":"Biointerphases","last_mentioned_on":1472776539,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/avs\/journal\/bip\/11\/2\/10.1116\/1.4945306","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1116\/1.4945306"],"pmid":"27052005","pubdate":"2016-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AVS: Science & Technology of Materials, Interfaces, and Processing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"021003","subjects":["biomedicalengineering","biotechnology"],"title":"Positively charged supported lipid bilayer formation on gold surfaces for neuronal cell culture","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/positively-charged-supported-lipid-bilayer-formation-gold-surfaces-neuronal-cell-culture"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":3605342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4593254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273124,"mean":11.551167268959,"rank":108714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":159642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273124,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":2.336039800995,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.6421052631579,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
