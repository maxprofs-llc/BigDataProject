Visit"],"citation":{"abstract":"Research has not yet compared the treatment effects of dalfampridine with traditional rehabilitation of gait impairments in multiple sclerosis (MS). The purpose of this review was to critically appraise the evidence for dalfampridine and gait training for increasing gait speed in people with MS.\nA systematic search of the research literature was conducted. Consideration was given to only randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. For selection of gait training studies, only studies involving task-specific gait training interventions and measuring treatment effects on gait speed were considered.\nTreatment effects on gait speed were extracted from four studies examining the efficacy of dalfampridine and six gait training RCTs. Overall mean increase in gait speed with dalfampridine was 0.07 m\/s (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04-0.09 m\/s) compared to 0.06 m\/s (95% CI, 0.02-0.10 m\/s) for gait training. Among dalfampridine responders (38% of participants in RCTs), the mean increase in gait speed was 0.16 m\/s (95% CI, 0.13-0.18 m\/s). Mean increases for individual gait training interventions ranged from 0.01 to 0.39 m\/s; however, CIs were wide due to small sample sizes.\nCurrent evidence is insufficient to conclude whether dalfampridine or gait training is superior for improving gait speed in people with MS. These findings should be viewed cautiously due to differences in study populations and small sample sizes in gait training studies. Both treatment approaches provide only short-lived improvements. Head-to-head comparison trials and studies combining both treatment modalities are needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007960","authors":["Plummer, Prudence","Prudence Plummer"],"doi":"10.7224\/1537-2073.2014-114","endpage":"115","first_seen_on":"2016-06-03T10:07:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1537-2073"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of MS Care","last_mentioned_on":1466663477,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27252597?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/ijmsc.org\/doi\/full\/10.7224\/1537-2073.2014-114"],"pmcid":"PMC4886996","pmid":"27252597","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"105","title":"Critical Appraisal of Evidence for Improving Gait Speed in People with Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/critical-appraisal-evidence-improving-gait-speed-people-multiple-sclerosis-dalfampridine-versus-gait"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7936934,"mean":6.7106933012983,"rank":3341833,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4560425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7936934,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270137,"mean":11.385177192229,"rank":105274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":162746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270137,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159,"mean":7.4558734177215,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.4944444444444,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GY":1,"IE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MltplSclppr\/statuses\/738673109515919362","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8456250],"posted_on":"2016-06-03T10:06:07+00:00","author":{"name":"MS Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/599614030790008833\/7IuEjHC7_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"MltplSclppr","tweeter_id":"3262004991","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":212},"tweet_id":"738673109515919362"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IJMSCtweets\/statuses\/745819454542536705","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8456250],"posted_on":"2016-06-23T03:23:09+00:00","author":{"name":"IJMSC","url":"http:\/\/ijmsc.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/910894161833885696\/450cIMaz_normal.jpg","description":"The International Journal of MS Care (IJMSC) is the official peer-reviewed journal of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC).","id_on_source":"IJMSCtweets","tweeter_id":"1054320667","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":238},"tweet_id":"745819454542536705"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/susancoote\/statuses\/745864756192546816","license":"gnip","rt":["IJMSCtweets"],"citation_ids":[8456250],"posted_on":"2016-06-23T06:23:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Susan Coote","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/748548116907962369\/A9C-4GGs_normal.jpg","description":"multiple sclerosis researcher, Associate Professor in physiotherapy, University of Limerick, views my own, re-tweet doesn't indicate endorsement,","id_on_source":"susancoote","tweeter_id":"216650914","geo":{"lt":5,"ln":-59,"country":"GY"},"followers":1096},"tweet_id":"745864756192546816"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DeclanGroeger\/statuses\/745866801167335424","license":"gnip","rt":["IJMSCtweets"],"citation_ids":[8456250],"posted_on":"2016-06-23T06:31:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Declan Groeger","url":"http:\/\/able2access.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/754273699101106180\/IwFAOX_f_normal.jpg","description":"MS 29 years and counting.
