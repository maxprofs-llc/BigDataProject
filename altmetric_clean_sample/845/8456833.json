In species with parental care, another potential advantage is the possibility to adjust parental behavior in relation to the numerosity of the progeny. The finding that many fish vary their parental investment in relation to brood size advocates the existence of a mechanism for appraising offspring number, an aspect that has never been directly investigated. Here we tested the ability of parental female convict cichlid (Amatitlania nigrofasciata) to discriminate between two fry groups differing in number by measuring time spent attempting to recover groups of fry experimentally displaced from the next. Females spent more time trying to recover the fry from larger groups when tested with contrasts 6 versus 12 (1:2) and 6 versus 9 fry (2:3); however, they showed no preference in the 6 versus 8 (3:4) contrast, suggesting that this task exceeds their discrimination capacity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002259","authors":["Forsatkar, Mohammad Navid","Nematollahi, Mohammad Ali","Bisazza, Angelo","Mohammad Navid Forsatkar","Mohammad Ali Nematollahi","Angelo Bisazza"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10071-016-0997-y","first_seen_on":"2016-06-03T10:30:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1435-9456","1435-9448"],"journal":"Animal Cognition","last_mentioned_on":1470063009,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27250099?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27250099?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10071-016-0997-y?utm_content=bufferabdb6&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10071-016-0997-y"],"pmid":"27250099","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Behavioral Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Quantity discrimination in parental fish: female convict cichlid discriminate fry shoals of different sizes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantity-discrimination-parental-fish-female-convict-cichlid-discriminate-fry-shoals-different-sizes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150076,"mean":6.9043957460448,"rank":3410789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4687818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150076,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271692,"mean":11.51185727168,"rank":102539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":166383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271692,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":769,"mean":20.961106770833,"rank":487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":769,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":39.631285714286,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
