The MIAS included 46 items and 4 dimensions: acceptance, rehabilitation and prognosis, social distance and recommendations for interventions.\nRehabilitation and prognosis had the highest item average scores (4.03) and social distance had the lowest item average scores (3.22). Stigmatization and the number of different types of contacted clients were two significantly associated attitude factors.\nPsychiatric hospital personnel in Taiwan tend to have positive attitudes toward people with mental illness in general situations but hold less positive attitudes in terms of community integration-related issues and intimate relationships. More evidence-based community services should be conducted to decrease personnel concerns about the successful community integration of those who are mentally ill. Future studies can investigate the concept and impact of stigmatization more deeply.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ba2","authors":["Ming-De Chen","Yen-Ching
