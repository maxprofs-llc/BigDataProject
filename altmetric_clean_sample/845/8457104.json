Using a randomized controlled design, participants were randomly assigned to receive either bright light (n = 30) or low intensity light (n = 30) for eight weeks. Bright light exposure was associated with significant improvement in depression and agitation, while participants receiving low intensity light displayed higher levels of depression and agitation or no significant change. Findings support the use of bright light exposure to reduce depression and agitation in this population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f23","authors":["Onega, Lisa L","Pierce, Thomas W","Epperly, Lora"],"doi":"10.1080\/01612840.2016.1183736","endpage":"8","first_seen_on":"2016-06-03T10:40:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-4673","0161-2840"],"journal":"Issues in Mental Health Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1465578878,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27254531?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27254531"],"pmid":"27254531","pubdate":"2016-06-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["nursing","psychology"],"title":"Effect of Bright Light Exposure on Depression and Agitation in Older Adults with Dementia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-bright-light-exposure-depression-agitation-older-adults-dementia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7879571,"mean":6.6725285125901,"rank":841606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7026986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7879571,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269553,"mean":11.376873738647,"rank":42819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":225895,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269553,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":473,"mean":3.3631313559322,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":473,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":2.346875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/738681745776640000","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8457104],"posted_on":"2016-06-03T10:40:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":982},"tweet_id":"738681745776640000"}],"news":[{"title":"Effect of Bright Light Exposure on Depression and Agitation in Older Adults with Dementia.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=26851389321&p=1pl&v=1&x=Uf9SQTEGUbnEcbMpanlXxQ","license":"public","citation_ids":[8457104],"posted_on":"2016-06-10T17:14:38+00:00","summary":".
