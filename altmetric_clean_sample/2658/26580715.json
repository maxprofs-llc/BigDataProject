We reviewed the available literature and used our clinical experience to develop a progressive, 5-tiered classification of procedures, encompassing clean, aseptic, sterile-superficial, sterile-invasive, and surgical-like procedures to address this need. We provide a description of these categories, along with relevant examples. We fully acknowledge the limitations of our work, which is intended as a starting point for future efforts and not to be definitive.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005709","authors":["Vincent Masse","Michael B.
