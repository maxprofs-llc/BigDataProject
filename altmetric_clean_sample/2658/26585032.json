For each test, distance walked, heart rate and reduction in speed were assessed.\nThe mean distance walked and mean heart rate were significantly higher in the 6MWT (441 m (standard deviation) (SD 79.7); 118 bpm (SD 19.2)) compared with the WECT (366 m (SD 67.3); 103 bpm (SD 14.3)); p\u2009<\u20090.001. Furthermore, during the 6MWT, patients continuously slowed down (-6%), while during the WECT speed dropped only slightly during the first 2 min, by -1.8% in total. Test-retest reliability of both tests was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)\u2265\u20090.95; lower bound 95% confidence interval (95% CI) \u2265\u20090.87). The smallest detectable change for the walked distance was 42 m (9.7% change from the mean) and 50 m (13.7%) on the 6MWT and WECT, respectively.\nBoth the 6MWT and the WECT are reliable to assess walking capacity in polio survivors, with slightly superior sensitivity to detect change for the 6MWT. Differences in walking dynamics confirm that the tests cannot be used interchangeably. The 6MWT is recommended for measuring maximal walking capacity and the WECT for measuring submaximal walking capacity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040c6","authors":["M Brehm","S Verduijn","J Bon","N Bredt","F Nollet"],"doi":"10.2340\/16501977-2264","first_seen_on":"2017-09-26T07:40:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1650-1977"],"journal":"Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1506538642,"links":["https:\/\/www.medicaljournals.se\/jrm\/content\/html\/10.2340\/16501977-2264","https:\/\/www.medicaljournals.se\/jrm\/content\/html\/10.2340\/16501977-2264?utm_content=buffer2010b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"28929170","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Comparison of two 6-minute walk tests to assess walking capacity in polio survivors","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-two-6minute-walk-tests-assess-walking-capacity-polio-survivors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":3.45,"6m":3.45,"3m":3.45,"1m":3.45,"1w":3.45,"6d":2.2,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":2059967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6391976,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114617,"mean":11.470872024848,"rank":32612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":81683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114617,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":482,"mean":3.2405155925156,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":482,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JRehabilMed\/statuses\/912582535653265408","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26585032],"posted_on":"2017-09-26T07:40:06+00:00","author":{"name":"J Rehabil Med","url":"http:\/\/www.medicaljournals.se\/jrm","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/834335055304617984\/IWD0YOeO_normal.jpg","description":"Get the latest updates about Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine \u2013 a journal publishing articles in the field of rehabilitation medicine.","id_on_source":"JRehabilMed","tweeter_id":"307875060","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":180},"tweet_id":"912582535653265408"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/postpolionews\/statuses\/913100681279623168","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26585032],"posted_on":"2017-09-27T17:59:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Post-Polio News","url":"https:\/\/www.post-polio.org.uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000571299619\/4fad51378685b137344ccbd5b7c9aee3_normal.png","description":"Incorporating NewsBites (Est. 1997) & Polio and Post-Polio News (Est. 2004).
