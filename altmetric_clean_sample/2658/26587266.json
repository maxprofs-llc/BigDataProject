In DED the level of tear hyperosmolarity is compared with that of a control population. It is proposed here that a better index of body hydration and a more valid reference point in DED can be acquired by measuring the tOsm after a period of evaporative suppression.\n8 normal and DED subjects were recruited, their tOsm measured in uncontrolled environmental 'clinic conditions'. Then in experiment 1 they entered a controlled environment chamber and had tOsm measured after 45 minutes of eye closure and then, with the eyes open, at 15 minute intervals for a further 45 minutes, at a relative humidity (RH) of 45%. Alternatively, in experiment 2, they had tOsm measured every 15 minutes for 45 minutes during exposure to 70% RH, as a separate measure to suppress evaporation.\nA significant decrease in tOsm occurred in both normal and DED subjects after lid closure in experiment 1 (normal RE p=0.015; normal LE p=0.006; DED RE p=0.0002; DED LE p=0.01). The tOsm also fell slightly after exposure to 70% RH in experiment 2 significant in the LE of normal group only (normal LE p=0.045).\nSuppression of tear evaporation resulted in a fall in tOsm, close to that of plasma osmolarity (285-295mOsm\/L). It is proposed that this new measure, termed Basal Tear Osmolarity (BTO), could provide a valuable index of plasma osmolarity and hence of body hydration and in DED, a personal baseline against which to gauge the severity of tear hyperosmolarity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002610","authors":["Catherine Willshire","Roger J.
