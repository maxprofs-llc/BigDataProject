We compared its efficacy and safety with that of the reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nIn this international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study (ARCHER 1050), we enrolled adults (aged \u226518 years or \u226520 years in Japan and South Korea) with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC and one EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or Leu858Arg) at 71 academic medical centres and university hospitals in seven countries or special administrative regions. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive oral dacomitinib 45 mg\/day (in 28-day cycles) or oral gefitinib 250 mg\/day (in 28-day cycles) until disease progression or another discontinuation criterion was met. Randomisation, stratified by race and EGFR mutation type, was done with a computer-generated random code assigned by a central interactive web response system. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by masked independent review in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01774721, and is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients.\nBetween May 9, 2013, and March 20, 2015, 452 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive dacomitinib (n=227) or gefitinib (n=225). Median duration of follow-up for progression-free survival was 22\u00b71 months (95% CI 20\u00b73-23\u00b79). Median progression-free survival according to masked independent review was 14\u00b77 months (95% CI 11\u00b71-16\u00b76) in the dacomitinib group and 9\u00b72 months (9\u00b71-11\u00b70) in the gefitinib group (hazard ratio 0\u00b759, 95% CI 0\u00b747-0\u00b774; p<0\u00b70001). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were dermatitis acneiform (31 [14%] of 227 patients given dacomitinib vs none of 224 patients given gefitinib), diarrhoea (19 [8%] vs two [1%]), and raised alanine aminotransferase levels (two [1%] vs 19 [8%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 21 (9%) patients given dacomitinib and in ten (4%) patients given gefitinib. Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the dacomitinib group (one related to untreated diarrhoea and one to untreated cholelithases\/liver disease) and one in the gefitinib group (related to sigmoid colon diverticulitis\/rupture complicated by pneumonia).\nDacomitinib significantly improved progression-free survival over gefitinib in first-line treatment of patients with EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLC and should be considered as a new treatment option for this population.\nSFJ Pharmaceuticals Group and Pfizer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fd1","authors":["Wu, Yi-Long","Cheng,
