The presence of marine debris (macro-debris) in the stomach contents of emaciated juvenile penguins stranded from 21\u00b0S to 23\u00b0S was compared at different times (2000 and 2008), and the debris ingestion pathway was determined. The frequency of marine debris in the stomachs doubled in less than a decade, and flexible plastics remained the main ingested item over time (68-70%). The pelagic octopus, Argonauta nodosa, which inhabits the sea surface, was the most important prey species recovered in the stomach contents. The poor physical condition of the penguins that reach the northern migration limit (study area) reduces the diving capacity of the animals and increases their vulnerability to debris ingestion. Considering their preferred prey and physical condition, we conclude that the penguins likely ingested the marine debris in surface waters.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006690","authors":["Di Beneditto, Ana Paula Madeira","Siciliano, Salvatore","Ana Paula Madeira Di Beneditto","Salvatore Siciliano"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.marpolbul.2017.09.044","first_seen_on":"2017-09-26T09:41:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0025-326X","0025326X","1879-3363"],"journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1506762165,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0025326X17307798&_version=1&md5=c11be223d18b05d103ee342de14cb748","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0025326X17307798"],"pmid":"28958439","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Earth and Planetary Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Marine debris boost in juvenile Magellanic penguins stranded in south-eastern Brazil in less than a decade: Insights into feeding habits and habitat use","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/marine-debris-boost-juvenile-magellanic-penguins-stranded-southeastern-brazil-less-decade-insights-f"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":3.6,"6m":3.6,"3m":3.6,"1m":3.6,"1w":3.6,"6d":3.35,"5d":0.5,"4d":0.5,"3d":0.5,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":1997529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6451212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114720,"mean":11.471987290684,"rank":31735,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":82624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114720,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3210,"mean":5.0658466812091,"rank":796,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":2406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3210,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":2.004,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ecotoxicology\/statuses\/912608056416116736","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26588592],"posted_on":"2017-09-26T09:21:30+00:00","author":{"name":"ecotoxicology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/499652563751280642\/9Yw-u5dW_normal.png","description":"Ecotoxicology and Environmental Pollution  Publications Feed.
