Community-associated S. aureus from nasal colonization (n = 100) and infection (n = 86) were prospectively collected. Phenotypic susceptibility testing and WGS was done for each isolate. WGS data were used to screen for 79 different virulence factors and for genotyping purposes (spa typing, multilocus sequence typing). The majority of the 79 virulence factors were equally distributed among isolates from colonization and infection. Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and the non-truncated hemolysin \u03b2 were associated with skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) and recurrence of disease but did not influence the course of infection (i.e., mortality, surgical intervention). For the first time, we show that not only PVL but also hemolysin \u03b2 could contribute to the development of SSTI in PVL-endemic areas such as Africa.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc10","authors":["Lebughe, Marthe","Phaku, Patrick","Niemann, Silke","Mumba, Dieudonn\u00e9","Peters, Georg","Muyembe-Tamfum, Jean-Jacques","Mellmann, Alexander","Strauss, Lena","Schaumburg, Frieder","Strau\u00df, Lena","Marthe Lebughe","Patrick Phaku","Silke Niemann","Dieudonn\u00e9 Mumba","Georg Peters","Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum","Alexander Mellmann","Lena Strau\u00df","Frieder Schaumburg"],"doi":"10.3389\/fmicb.2017.01662","first_seen_on":"2017-08-19T23:10:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1664-302X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1505915133,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fmicb.2017.01662\/abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28900424","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3389\/fmicb.2017.01662"],"pmcid":"PMC5581934","pmid":"28900424","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"The impact of the Staphylococcus aureus virulome on infection in a developing country: a cohort study","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-staphylococcus-aureus-virulome-infection-developing-country-cohort-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.33,"score_history":{"1y":7.33,"6m":7.33,"3m":7.33,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.33},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440508,"mean":7.0976499018281,"rank":1207523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":7229655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440508,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190179,"mean":12.800396060533,"rank":37165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":152842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190179,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6150,"mean":4.7204504797528,"rank":1129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":4986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6150,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228,"mean":6.4759118942731,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"August 19, 2017","url":"https:\/\/microbiomedigest.com\/2017\/08\/19\/august-19-2017\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[24040544,24031324,24065573,24028470,24017354,24065812,24066113,24065862,24084586,24087481,24017502,23948216,24065676,24087485,24017778,22688780,24038737,24087486],"posted_on":"2017-08-19T16:22:00+00:00","summary":"Today, a short Digest but with interesting features: effects of intestinal cleanout on microbiota, changes in K vitamin derivatives in human, reviews about Streptococcus group B and effect of FMT on&nbsp;Clostridium difficile, and more.
