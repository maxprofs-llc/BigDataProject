A total of 20 emergencies were simulated; Group 1 performed simulations followed by a 4-hour theoretical training, Group 2 underwent 4-hour training first and then performed simulations. All simulations were recorded and scored by two independent physicians. Time to conversion (TC) and procedural errors were analyzed and compared between the two groups. A correlation analysis between the number of previous conversion simulations, total errors number and TC was performed for each group.\nGroup 1 showed a higher TC than group 2 (116.5 vs. 86.5 s, p=0.0.53). As the number of simulation increased, the numbers of errors declined in both groups. The two groups tend to converge towards 0 errors after 9 simulations however, the linear correlation was more pronounced in group 1 (R(2)=0.75). TC shows a progressive decline for both groups as the number of simulations increases (group 1, R(2)=0.7 and group 2, R(2)=0.61), but it remains higher for group 1. Lack of task sequence and accidental falls\/loss of sterility were higher in group 1.\nOpen conversion is a rare but potentially dramatic event in the setting of RAPN, and every robotic team should be prepared to manage intraoperative emergencies. Training protocols can effectively improve teamwork and facilitate timely conversions to open surgery in the event of intraoperative emergencies during RAPN. Further studies are needed to confirm if such protocols may translate into an actual safety improvement in clinical settings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036e4","authors":["Fabio Zattoni","Alessandro Morlacco","Francesco Cattaneo","Matteo Soligo","Luca Meggiato","Daniele Modonutti","Claudio Valotto","Fabrizio Dal Moro","Filiberto Zattoni"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.urology.2017.06.057","first_seen_on":"2017-08-20T00:17:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00904295","1527-9995"],"journal":"Urology","last_mentioned_on":1503189461,"links":["http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090-4295(17)30864-6\/fulltext?rss=yes"],"pmid":"28827196","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Development of a Surgical Safety Training Program and Checklist for Conversion during Robotic Partial Nephrectomies","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-surgical-safety-training-program-checklist-conversion-during-robotic-partial-nephrectomi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":1.1,"6m":1.1,"3m":1.1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":4458621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3916443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166946,"mean":12.69790823325,"rank":90320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":75376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166946,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3317,"mean":4.2438069963812,"rank":1855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3317,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":4.3672727272727,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UrologyMatch\/statuses\/899062746653892608","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24088516],"posted_on":"2017-08-20T00:17:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Urology Match","url":"http:\/\/www.urologymatch.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/670243589750935552\/vkJCRb_7_normal.jpg","description":"Premier Internet portal to keep abreast of the exciting field of Urology.
