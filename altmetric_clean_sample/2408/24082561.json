Increased Cyfra 21 serum levels and their benefit as a tumor marker have been shown in some malignancies. This study aimed to evaluate the serum levels of Cyfra 21 in patients with benign and malignant salivary gland tumors.\nIn this cross-sectional study, the serum level of Cyfra 21 in 44 patients with malignant salivary gland tumors and 16 cases of pleomorphic adenoma were compared with 28 healthy controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Data were analyzed statistically using the Kruskal Wallis test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Spearman's correlation tests.\nMean serum levels of Cyfra 21 were 0.135 \u00b1 0.285 ng\/ ml in the control group, 0.167 \u00b1 0.142 ng\/ ml in patients with pleomorphic adenoma and 1.059 \u00b1 3.251 ng\/ml in patients with malignant salivary gland tumors. There was no significant difference among groups. Cyfra 21 levels did not correlate with location of tumor, clinical stage or cigarette smoking.\nResults of the present study showed no significant difference in Cyfra 21 serum level in salivary gland tumors compared with normal individuals. In addition, Cyfra 21 serum level was not sufficiently sensitive to function as a tumor marker in salivary gland tumors.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef792a83ee09648b5338","authors":["Jeiroodi, Naghmeh","Aslani, Seyed Mohammad-Javad","Khademi, Bijan","Malekzadeh, Mahyar","Jaafari-Ashkavandi, Zohreh"],"first_seen_on":"2017-08-19T18:59:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2251-7251"],"issue":"93","journal":"Iranian Journal of Otorhinolaryngology","last_mentioned_on":1503169144,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28819618?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28819618","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Serum Levels of Cyfra 21 in Patients with Benign and Malignant Salivary Gland Tumors.","type":"article","volume":"29"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":7258210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165918,"mean":12.815007985921,"rank":135966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165918,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":0.78524590163934,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/898982666514518017","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24082561],"posted_on":"2017-08-19T18:59:04+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":384},"tweet_id":"898982666514518017"}]}}
