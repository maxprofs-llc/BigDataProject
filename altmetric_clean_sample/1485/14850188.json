At its simplest, this model gives the dielectric constant at low ionic strength I as \u03b5r(I) = \u03b5r(0)(1 + \u03b1I)(-1), where \u03b1 (the excess polarization) is directly related to the dressed-ion charge. One contribution to the origin of the dielectric decrement is thus seen to stem from the electrostatic screening of the ions in solution, with no solvent contributions necessary.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ee3","authors":["Rasmus A.
