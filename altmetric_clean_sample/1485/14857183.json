In this study, the leaves of sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) were analyzed to determine the nature of the syrB-inducing activity associated with tissues of a susceptible host. Crude leaf extracts yielded high amounts of total signal activity of more than 12,000 units g-1 (fresh weight) based on activation of a syrB-lacZ fusion in strain B3AR132. The signal activity was fractionated by C18 reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and found to be composed of phenolic glycosides, which were resolved in three regions of the high-performance liquid chromatography profile, and sugars, which eluted with the void volume. Two flavonol glycosides, quercetin 3-rutinosyl-4[prime]-glucoside and kaempferol 3-rutinosyl-4[prime]-glucoside, and a flavanone glucoside, dihydrowogonin 7-glucoside, were identified. The flavonoid glycosides displayed similar specific signal activities and were comparable in signal activity to arbutin, a phenyl [beta]-glucoside, giving rise to between 120 and 160 units of [beta]-galactosidase activity at 10 [mu]M. Although D-fructose exhibits intrinsic low level syrB-inducing signal activity, D-fructose enhanced by about 10-fold the signal activities of the flavonoid glycosides at low concentrations (e.g. 10 [mu]M). This demonstrates that flavonoid glycosides, which represent a new class of phenolic plant signals sensed by P. s. syringae, are in sufficient quantities in the leaves of P. avium to activate phytotoxin synthesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333b","authors":["Y.
