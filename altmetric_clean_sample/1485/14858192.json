Data was gathered by interviews. The mental health service users described promoting and retarding factors in the use of gamification, while professionals described the requirements for using gamification and changes occurring in the work culture. Additional research is needed on how game-playing elements could be integrated as a systematic part of mental health practice and how the digital skills of professionals could be effectively developed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f23","authors":["Hanna Hopia"],"doi":"10.1080\/01612840.2016.1233595","endpage":"902","first_seen_on":"2016-12-19T18:09:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-4673","0161-2840"],"issue":"12","journal":"Issues in Mental Health Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1482335082,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/01612840.2016.1233595#.WFgh0aLheCc.twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/01612840.2016.1233595"],"pmid":"27905826","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"894","subjects":["nursing","psychology"],"title":"Gamification in Healthcare: Perspectives of Mental Health Service Users and Health Professionals","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gamification-healthcare-perspectives-mental-health-service-users-health-professionals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7917108,"mean":6.6979661075636,"rank":6003508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1062717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7917108,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251046,"mean":12.387087486307,"rank":177200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":45549,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251046,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":478,"mean":3.3780880503145,"rank":325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":478,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":3.0722222222222,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":8,"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Lecturer":1,"Student  > Ph.
