However, lacking the confidence score for predicted values has limited their applications. Here we investigated whether or not we can make a reasonable prediction of absolute errors for predicted backbone torsion angles, C\u03b1-atom-based angles and torsion angles, solvent accessibility, contact numbers and half-sphere exposures by employing deep neural networks.\nWe found that angle-based errors can be predicted most accurately with Spearman correlation coefficient (SPC) between predicted and actual errors at about 0.6. This is followed by solvent accessibility (SPC~0.5). The errors on contact-based structural properties are most difficult to predict (SPC between 0.2 and 0.3). We showed that predicted errors are significantly better error indicators than the average errors based on secondary-structure and amino-acid residue types. We further demonstrated the usefulness of predicted errors in model quality assessment. These error or confidence indictors are expected to be useful for prediction, assessment, and refinement of protein structures.\nThe method is available at http:\/\/sparks-lab.org as a part of SPIDER2 package.\nyuedong.yang@griffith.edu.au or yaoqi.zhou@griffith.edu.au SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d2","authors":["Jianzhao Gao","Yuedong Yang","Yaoqi Zhou"],"doi":"10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btw549","endpage":"3773","first_seen_on":"2016-12-19T17:19:42+00:00","issns":["1367-4811","1460-2059","1367-4803"],"issue":"24","journal":"Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1502974203,"links":["http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/32\/24\/3768.short?rss=1","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27551104?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/32\/24\/3768.full.pdf","pmid":"27551104","pubdate":"2016-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Mathematics","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"3768","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Predicting the errors of predicted local backbone angles and non-local solvent- accessibilities of proteins by deep neural networks","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predicting-errors-predicted-local-backbone-angles-nonlocal-solvent-accessibilities-proteins-deep-neu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":6366788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1137764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277849,"mean":12.101875190751,"rank":195002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":51368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277849,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5771,"mean":6.8068779896014,"rank":5162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5771,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":6.4767924528302,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
