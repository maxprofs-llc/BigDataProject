Muscle biopsies for glycogen determination were taken before and after exercise, and every second hour during recovery. Blood samples for plasma glucose and insulin determination were taken before and after exercise, and every hour during recovery. When 0.35 (low glucose: N = 5), 0.70 (medium glucose: N = 5), or 1.40 (high glucose: N = 5) g.kg-1 body weight of glucose were given orally at 0, 2, and 4 h after exercise, the rates of glycogen synthesis were (mean +\/- SE) 2.1 +\/- 0.5, 5.8 +\/- 1.0, and 5.7 +\/- 0.9 mmol.kg-1.h-1, respectively. When 0.70 g.kg-1 body weight of sucrose (medium sucrose: N = 5), or fructose (medium fructose: N = 7) was ingested accordingly, the rates were 6.2 +\/- 0.5 and 3.2 +\/- 0.7 mmol.kg-1.h-1. Average plasma glucose level during recovery were similar in low glucose, medium glucose, and high glucose groups (5.76 +\/- 0.24, 6.31 +\/- 0.64, and 6.52 +\/- 0.24 mM), while average plasma insulin levels were higher with higher glucose intake (16 +\/- 1, 21 +\/- 3, and 38 +\/- 4 microU.ml-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","authors":["Blom, P C","H\u00f8stmark, A T","Vaage, O","Kardel, K R","Maehlum, S"],"first_seen_on":"2016-12-19T11:29:33+00:00","issns":["0195-9131"],"issue":"5","journal":"Medicine and science in sports and exercise","last_mentioned_on":1482146915,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3316904"],"pmid":"3316904","pubdate":"1987-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Effect of different post-exercise sugar diets on the rate of muscle glycogen synthesis.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-different-postexercise-sugar-diets-rate-muscle-glycogen-synthesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
