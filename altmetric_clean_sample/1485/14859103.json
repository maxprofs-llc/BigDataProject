Monetary authorities have this power because of the requirements of improving financial services, protecting the rights of depositors, adapting to industrial development, ensuring financial fair trade, and maintaining stable financial order. To establish evaluation criteria for bank supervision in China, this study integrated fuzzy theory and the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and proposes a fuzzy-DEMATEL model. First, fuzzy theory was applied to examine bank supervision criteria and analyze fuzzy semantics. Second, the fuzzy-DEMATEL model was used to calculate the degree to which financial supervision criteria mutually influenced one another and their causal relationship. Finally, an evaluation criteria model for evaluating bank and financial supervision was established.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Sang-Bing Tsai","Kuan-Yu Chen","Hongrui Zhao","Yu-Min Wei","Cheng-Kuang Wang","Yuxiang Zheng","Li-Chung Chang","Jiangtao Wang"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0167710","first_seen_on":"2016-12-19T19:01:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1482174095,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0167710&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0167710&type=printable","pmcid":"PMC5167262","pmid":"27992449","pubdate":"2016-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0167710","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Using a Mixed Model to Explore Evaluation Criteria for Bank Supervision: A Banking Supervision Law Perspective","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0167710","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/using-mixed-model-explore-evaluation-criteria-bank-supervision-banking-supervision-law-perspective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7909849,"mean":6.6937446400934,"rank":6848513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7909849,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250611,"mean":12.388937959379,"rank":205117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250611,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111193,"mean":10.333020882798,"rank":93806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111193,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3816,"mean":12.571068938401,"rank":3019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3816,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/neuropapersbot\/statuses\/810923045904711680","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14859103],"posted_on":"2016-12-19T19:01:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Neuroscience Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"hi there, I am a twitter bot who tweets new papers in neuroscience","id_on_source":"neuropapersbot","tweeter_id":"757895584317440000","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":22},"tweet_id":"810923045904711680"}]}}
