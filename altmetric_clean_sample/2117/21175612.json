Films are characterized in terms of surface, mechanical, and piezoelectric features before in vitro testing on SH-SY5Y cells. In particular, BTNPs significantly improve piezoelectric properties of the films (4.5-fold increased d31 ). Both kinds of films support good SH-SY5Y viability and differentiation. Ultrasound (US) stimulation is proven to elicit Ca(2+) transients and to enhance differentiation in cells grown on the piezoelectric substrates. For the first time in the literature, this study demonstrates the suitability of polymer\/ceramic composite films and US for neuronal stimulation through direct piezoelectric effect.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006894","authors":["Giada Graziana Genchi","Luca Ceseracciu","Attilio Marino","Massimiliano Labardi","Sergio Marras","Francesca Pignatelli","Luca Bruschini","Virgilio Mattoli","Gianni Ciofani"],"doi":"10.1002\/adhm.201600245","first_seen_on":"2017-06-19T15:56:29+00:00","issns":["21922640"],"issue":"14","journal":"Advanced Healthcare Materials","last_mentioned_on":1503503100,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/adhm.201600245"],"pmid":"27283784","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"P(VDF-TrFE)\/BaTiO3Nanoparticle Composite Films Mediate Piezoelectric Stimulation and Promote Differentiation of SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cells","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pvdftrfebatio3-nanoparticle-composite-films-mediate-piezoelectric-stimulation-promote-differentiatio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.008,"score_history":{"1y":12.008,"6m":12.008,"3m":5.008,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.008},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":723121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7695665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238437,"mean":12.939100848865,"rank":33607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":204828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238437,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":938,"mean":7.9562668089648,"rank":106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":832,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":938,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":11.309275862069,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
