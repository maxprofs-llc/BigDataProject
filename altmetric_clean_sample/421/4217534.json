The aim of this study was to investigate the functional roles of miR-7 in chemoresistance of SCLC and its underlying mechanism. By using a bioinformatic assay, we found that MRP1\/ABCC1 was a potential target gene of miR-7. Expression of miR-7 and MRP1\/ABCC1 was examined in 44 SCLC samples by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry methods. Low-level expression of miR-7 was associated significantly with drug responsiveness and overall survival rate of patients with SCLC, but not with gender, age and stage. There was an inverse relationship between miR-7 and MRP1\/ABCC1 expression. Downregulation of MRP1\/ABCC1 level was revealed after transfection with a miR-7 mimic in H69 AR cells. Transfection of a miR-7 inhibitor into H69 cells restored MRP1\/ABCC1 expression. A dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-7 targeted predicted sites in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the MRP1\/ABCC1 gene. Our data suggested that miR-7 mediated SCLC chemoresistance by repressing MRP1\/ABCC1 and may be a prognostic predictor and potential therapeutic target in human SCLC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b4c","authors":["Liu, Huanxin","Wu, Xiaoxia","Huang, Jie","Peng, Juan","Guo, Linlang"],"doi":"10.1111\/iep.12131","first_seen_on":"2015-06-26T23:35:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1365-2613"],"journal":"International Journal of Experimental Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1435353422,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26108539?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26108539","pubdate":"2015-06-27T22:06:59+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"miR-7 modulates chemoresistance of small cell lung cancer by repressing MRP1\/ABCC1.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir7-modulates-chemoresistance-small-cell-lung-cancer-repressing-mrp1abcc1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5279668,"mean":6.2126101187845,"rank":4396736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5279668,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186286,"mean":8.4501826019273,"rank":150553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186286,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":6.1568888888889,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
