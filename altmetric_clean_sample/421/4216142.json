The energy weighting technique was originally developed to obtain the maximum benefit from the spectroscopic information. In all previous published papers the concept of an energy weighting function was tested on relatively simple test objects having only two materials with different absorption coefficients.\nIn this study the shape of the energy weighting function was investigated with a set of ten trabecular bone test objects each with a similar geometry and structure but with different attenuation properties. In previous publications it was determined that the function E-3 was a very good choice for the weighting function (wi).\nThe most important Result from this study was the discovery that a single function of the form E-b was not sufficient to explain the energy dependence of the different types of materials that might be used to describe common bodily tissues such as trabecular bone. It was also determined from the data contained in this paper that the exponent b is often significantly dependent upon the attenuation properties of the materials that were used to make the test objects.\nStudies of the attenuation properties will be useful in further studies involving energy weighting.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000309b","authors":["K Ganezer","K Ganezer","M Krmar","I Josipovic"],"doi":"10.1118\/1.4924039","first_seen_on":"2015-06-26T14:28:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0094-2405"],"issue":"6","journal":"Medical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1435328813,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aapm\/journal\/medphys\/42\/6\/10.1118\/1.4924039?TRACK=RSS"],"pmid":"26127347","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association of Physicists in Medicine","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"SU-E-I-42: Some New Aspects of the Energy Weighting Technique","type":"article","volume":"42"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5279944,"mean":6.2124069797745,"rank":4396920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5279944,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186291,"mean":8.4500616565571,"rank":150545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186291,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2164,"mean":1.802631530282,"rank":1858,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2164,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":654,"mean":1.3572741194487,"rank":569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":654,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/medphyspapers\/status\/614439693791424512","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4216142],"posted_on":"2015-06-26T14:26:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Med Phys Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"New publications in Medical Physics and Radiotherapy.","id_on_source":"medphyspapers","tweeter_id":"2879791906","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":137},"tweet_id":"614439693791424512"}]}}
