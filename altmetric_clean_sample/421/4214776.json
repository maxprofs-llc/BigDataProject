The resulting BCR-ABL1 oncogene leads to increased proliferation and survival of leukemic cells. Successful treatment of CML has been accompanied by steady improvements in our capacity to accurately and sensitively monitor therapy response. Currently, measurement of BCR-ABL1 mRNA transcript levels by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) defines critical response endpoints. An antibody-based technique for BCR-ABL1 protein recognition could be an attractive alternative to RQ-PCR. To date, there have been no studies evaluating whether flow-cytometry based assays could be of clinical utility in evaluating residual disease in CML patients. Here we describe a flow-cytometry assay that detects the presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion proteins in CML lysates to determine the applicability, reliability, and specificity of this method for both diagnosis and monitoring of CML patients for initial response to therapy. We show that: i) CML can be properly diagnosed at onset, (ii) follow-up assessments show detectable fusion protein (i.e. relative mean fluorescent intensity, rMFI%>1) when BCR-ABL1IS transcripts are between 1-10%, and (iii) rMFI% levels predict CCyR as defined by FISH analysis. Overall, the FCBA assay is a rapid technique, fully translatable to the routine management of CML patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Recchia, Anna Grazia","Caruso, Nadia","Bossio, Sabrina","Pellican\u00f2, Mariavaleria","De Stefano, Laura","Franzese, Stefania","Palummo, Angela","Abbadessa, Vincenzo","Lucia, Eugenio","Gentile, Massimo","Vigna, Ernesto","Caracciolo, Clementina","Agostino, Antolino","Galimberti, Sara","Levato, Luciano","Stagno, Fabio","Molica, Stefano","Martino, Bruno","Vigneri, Paolo","Di Raimondo, Francesco","Morabito, Fortunato"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0130360","first_seen_on":"2015-06-26T10:48:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1435314431,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26111048?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26111048?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26111048","pubdate":"2015-06-26T22:00:36+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Flow Cytometric Immunobead Assay for Detection of BCR-ABL1 Fusion Proteins in Chronic Myleoid Leukemia: Comparison with FISH and PCR Techniques.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/flow-cytometric-immunobead-assay-detection-bcrabl1-fusion-proteins-chronic-myleoid-leukemia-comparis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5279944,"mean":6.2124069797745,"rank":4396923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5279944,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186291,"mean":8.4500656825381,"rank":150546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186291,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92497,"mean":9.5156908839301,"rank":77344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92497,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6351,"mean":8.6371524409449,"rank":5360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6351,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
