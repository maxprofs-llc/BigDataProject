Fmr1 KO mice were evaluated in the open field, marble burying and three-chamber test for the presence of hyperactivity, anxiety, repetitive behaviour, sociability and observation of social novelty compared with wild-type (WT) mice. The Fmr1 KO mice expressed anxiety and hyperactivity in the open field compared with WT mice. This increased level of hyperactivity was confirmed in the three-chamber test. Fmr1 KO mice spent more time with stranger mice compared with the WT. However, after a correction for hyperactivity, their apparent increase in sociability became identical to that of the WT. Furthermore, the Fmr1 KO mice could not differentiate between a familiar or a novel mouse. Monoamines were measured by HPLC: Fmr1 KO mice showed an increase in the striatal dopamine level. We conclude that the fragile X syndrome model seems to be useful for understanding certain aspects of ASD and may have translational interest for studies of social behaviour when hyperactivity coexists in ASD patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c00","authors":["S\u00f8rensen, Emilie M","Bertelsen, Freja","Weikop, Pia","Skovborg, Maria M","Banke, Tue","Drasbek, Kim R","Scheel-Kr\u00fcger, J\u00f8rgen"],"doi":"10.1097\/fbp.0000000000000152","first_seen_on":"2015-06-26T07:16:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0955-8810","1473-5849"],"issue":"8 - Special Issue Pharmacological Approaches To The Study Of Social Behaviour - Part 3: Drug Effects","journal":"Behavioural Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1447197019,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/behaviouralpharm\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Hyperactivity_and_lack_of_social_discrimination_in.99530.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26110222","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/behaviouralpharm\/pages\/articleviewer.aspx?article=99530&issue=00000&type=abstract&year=9000","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/behaviouralpharm\/Abstract\/2015\/12000\/Hyperactivity_and_lack_of_social_discrimination_in.3.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/behaviouralpharm\/9000\/00000\/Hyperactivity_and_lack_of_social_discrimination_in.99530.pdf","pmid":"26110222","pubdate":"2015-06-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","pharmacology"],"title":"Hyperactivity and lack of social discrimination in the adolescent Fmr1 knockout mouse","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hyperactivity-lack-social-discrimination-adolescent-fmr1-knockout-mouse"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7969435,"mean":6.7304812193633,"rank":3185261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4727350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7969435,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227986,"mean":8.1322733688621,"rank":78463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":147196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227986,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":709,"mean":2.2347372881356,"rank":157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":549,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":709,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.8,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
