Chemotherapy or radiation therapy was not a part of his initial JPA treatment. Owing to his two primary neoplasms, genetic testing was performed, which revealed heterozygous polymorphisms of unknown significance for CDH1 and p53, and negative BRAF mutation analysis. Our case reports development of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma after JPA in the absence of antecedent radiation and\/or chemotherapy, and identifiable genetic predisposition.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc98","authors":["Chen, Dillon Y","Crawford, John Ross"],"doi":"10.1136\/bcr-2015-209343","first_seen_on":"2015-06-27T10:13:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1757-790X"],"journal":"BMJ Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1435399985,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26113587?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26113587","pubdate":"2015-06-27T22:02:15+00:00","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Hodgkin's lymphoma in an adolescent previously treated with surgical resection of third ventricular juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hodgkins-lymphoma-adolescent-previously-treated-surgical-resection-third-ventricular-juvenile-pilocy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5281486,"mean":6.2131255898695,"rank":2803333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1791929,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5281486,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186286,"mean":8.4428516627749,"rank":102850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":65245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186286,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2495,"mean":3.5853728949479,"rank":949,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2495,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":2.4518803418803,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/genomeguardian\/status\/614738212863348736","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4219006],"posted_on":"2015-06-27T10:13:05+00:00","author":{"name":"TP53","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516935062370000897\/PnU7aavz_normal.jpeg","description":"A twitterbot dedicated to supplying the most recent papers about p53, the Guardian of the Genome.","id_on_source":"genomeguardian","tweeter_id":"2794540623","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":173},"tweet_id":"614738212863348736"}]}}
