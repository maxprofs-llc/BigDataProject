Gemcitabine, a first-line treatment for pancreatic cancer, prolongs patient survival by several months, and combination treatment with gemcitabine and other anti-cancer drugs in the clinic do not show any significant effects on overall survival. Thus, identification of a drug that resensitizes gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine and a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of gemcitabine resistance are critical to develop new therapeutic options for pancreatic cancer. Here, we report that zidovudine resensitizes gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine as shown by screening a compound library, including clinical medicine, using gemcitabine-resistant cells. In analyzing the molecular mechanisms of zidovudine effects, we found that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like phenotype and downregulation of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) are essential for the acquisition of gemcitabine resistance, and zidovudine restored these changes. The chemical biology investigations also revealed that activation of the Akt-GSK3\u03b2-Snail1 pathway in resistant cells is a key signaling event for gemcitabine resistance, and zidovudine resensitized resistant cells to gemcitabine by inhibiting this activated pathway. Moreover, our in vivo study demonstrated that co-administration of zidovudine and gemcitabine strongly suppressed the formation of tumors by gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer and prevented gemcitabine-sensitive pancreatic tumors from acquiring gemcitabine-resistant properties, inducing an EMT-like phenotype and downregulating hENT1 expression. These results suggested that co-treatment with zidovudine and gemcitabine may become a novel therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer by inhibiting chemoresistance-specific signaling.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e18","authors":["T Namba","R Kodama","S Moritomo","T Hoshino","T Mizushima"],"doi":"10.1038\/cddis.2015.172","first_seen_on":"2015-06-25T17:26:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-4889"],"issue":"6","journal":"Cell Death & Disease","last_mentioned_on":1505536744,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/cddis\/rss\/current\/~3\/jKEPv9clU70\/cddis.2015.172","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/cddis\/journal\/v6\/n6\/full\/cddis2015172a.html","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4669843\/"],"pmid":"26111057","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"e1795","subjects":["cellbiology","internalmedicine"],"title":"Zidovudine, an anti-viral drug, resensitizes gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine by inhibition of the Akt-GSK3|[beta]|-Snail pathway","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zidovudine-antiviral-drug-resensitizes-gemcitabineresistant-pancreatic-cancer-cells-gemcitabine-inhi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.35,"6m":1.35,"3m":1.35,"1m":1.35,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":820467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7600349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230867,"mean":8.334042604801,"rank":30228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":200535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230867,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1576,"mean":5.4769765079365,"rank":176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":1399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1576,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":9.8008941176471,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
