Recent work supports a role for miRNAs in the initiation and progression of human cancer. miRNA-214 not only mediates differentiation, senescence, angiogenesis, cell migration and virus replication but also acts as a tumor suppressor gene and oncogene. Increasing evidence indicates that miRNA-214 may serve as a biomarker in some cancer types. The aim of this review is to highlight and clarify the complexity of miRNA-214 activity, emphasizing its significant therapeutic and diagnostic potential.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000d002","authors":["He, Hengpeng","Zhang, Hao","Li, Zhiguo","Wang, Rui","Li, Nuo","Zhu, Li"],"doi":"10.5301\/tj.5000318","first_seen_on":"2015-06-26T23:44:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2038-2529"],"issue":"0","journal":"Tumori","last_mentioned_on":1435363564,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26108246?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26108246","pubdate":"2015-06-27T22:07:12+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"miRNA-214: expression, therapeutic and diagnostic potential in cancer.","type":"article","volume":"0","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mirna214-expression-therapeutic-diagnostic-potential-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5279944,"mean":6.2124069797745,"rank":3717813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":883032,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5279944,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186291,"mean":8.4500643405444,"rank":130213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":35746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186291,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183,"mean":1.7710659340659,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":77,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.1607142857143,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/status\/614559650843734016","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4217629],"posted_on":"2015-06-26T22:23:33+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
