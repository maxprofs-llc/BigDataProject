These tumors are morphologically characterized by extensive psammomatous calcifications, invasiveness and low-grade cytological features.\nWe present the case of a 54-year-old woman who was referred to our department with an umbilical tumor and increasing abdominal girth. The patient had had an umbilical hernia for more than 20 years. The CA 125 level was normal. The CT scan showed small peritoneal nodules at the level of the Douglas pouch, including the posterior wall of the uterus, and the entire colon, as well as large nodules located on the caecum and the sigmoid colon. We performed partial enterectomy, total colectomy with ileo-rectal anastomosis, omentectomy, total histerectomy and bilateral adnexectomy, pelvic peritonectomy of the Douglas pouch. Pathology findings were consistent with F.I.G.O. stage IIIC peritoneal PCa. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with Taxol and Carboplatin. To date, twelve months after surgery, the follow-up shows no evidence of disease.\nStandardized treatment protocols are hindered by the rarity of the PCas. However, literature concludes that optimal debulking is mandatory, whereas the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy remains to be elucidated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fec","authors":["Tog\u0103nel, R\u0103zvan Dan","\u015eimon, Ioan","Zolog, Adriana","Simescu, R\u0103zvan","Cozma, Angela","Muntean, Valentin"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-27T10:08:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1842-1121"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Gastrointestinal & Liver Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1458133820,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26114188?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26114188","pubdate":"2015-06-27T22:01:30+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Primary peritoneal serous psammocarcinoma: a case report.","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/primary-peritoneal-serous-psammocarcinoma-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7401456,"mean":6.433764966749,"rank":5339802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1802089,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7401456,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224747,"mean":8.0018690343767,"rank":142073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":69257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224747,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":1.7259577464789,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.25,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/status\/614737000147488768","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4218926],"posted_on":"2015-06-27T10:08:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":441},"tweet_id":"614737000147488768"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/710043499018584064","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4218926],"posted_on":"2016-03-16T10:02:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":441},"tweet_id":"710043499018584064"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/710090826118922241","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4218926],"posted_on":"2016-03-16T13:10:20+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":377},"tweet_id":"710090826118922241"}]}}
