A detailed physical examination to sort out possible causes of the gynaecomastia, including intracranial tumour, liver cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism, and adrenal and testicular tumour, was negative. No offending agent was found in his medication list. A CT scan of the head and ultrasound of the scrotum did not show any mass lesion. His serum \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) and oestradiol levels were elevated. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed bladder wall thickening with soft tissue mass. A cystoscopic biopsy confirmed transitional cell carcinoma with muscle invasion. The patient was started on chemotherapy but responded poorly. This case report describes the \u03b2-hCG and oestradiol-secreting transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder presenting as gynaecomastia in an older man.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc98","authors":["Mashrafi Ahmed","Aleem Kanji","Tahmina Begum","Ahmed, Mashrafi","Kanji, Aleem","Begum, Tahmina"],"doi":"10.1136\/bcr-2015-210649","first_seen_on":"2015-06-27T11:21:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1757-790X"],"journal":"BMJ Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1458642515,"links":["http:\/\/casereports.bmj.com\/content\/2015\/bcr-2015-210649.abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26113595?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/casereports.bmj.com\/content\/2015\/bcr-2015-210649.full.pdf","pmid":"26113595","pubdate":"2015-06-27T22:02:14+00:00","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Gynaecomastia: an unusual presenting symptom of bladder cancer","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gynaecomastia-unusual-presenting-symptom-bladder-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7424901,"mean":6.4566625821178,"rank":5357565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1806722,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7424901,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224975,"mean":8.01294486474,"rank":142344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":69213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224975,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2855,"mean":4.5678675543097,"rank":1544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2855,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":2.6745,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
