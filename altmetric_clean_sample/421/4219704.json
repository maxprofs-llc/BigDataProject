Female DMD\/BMD carriers (DMDc\/BMDc) are mostly free of skeletal muscle symptoms, but they are also prone to cardiomyopathy. The aim of the current study was to characterize the frequency, pattern, and extent of cardiomyopathy in female DMD\/BMD carriers (DMDc\/BMDc) in comparison to their first-degree male MD relatives.\nThirty-six (age 44 \u00b1 14 years) female MD carriers (20 DMDc and 16 BMDc) constituted the 'MD carrier group' and were prospectively enrolled. All MD carriers underwent a complete CMR study comprising cine- and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging. In 22 of these women ('female MD carrier comparison group', 7 DMD and 15 BMD), at least one first-degree male relative with a previously established diagnosis of MD underwent the same CMR protocol and was assigned to the 'male MD comparison group' (n = 24, 6 DMD and 18 BMD). In the total MD carrier group, 17 (47%) MD carriers had at least one pathological CMR finding [5 (14%) with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LV-EF) and 16 (44%) with the presence of LGE]. All LGE-positive patients (n = 16) showed non-ischaemic LGE with subepicardial involvement of the LV lateral free wall being the most frequent pattern (13\/16, 81%). Compared with BMDc, DMDc demonstrated more frequently a pathological CMR result (65 vs. 19%; P = 0.008)-in spite of being significantly younger (40 \u00b1 11 vs. 50 \u00b1 16 years, P = 0.038). In the male MD comparison group, the same LGE pattern as in female carriers was seen, but with a significantly higher prevalence of cardiac abnormalities compared with their female carrier relatives constituting the female MD comparison group (75 vs. 27%; P = 0.003).\nCardiac involvement is a frequent finding in female carriers of DMD, but less frequently observed in carriers of BMD. Those DMDc and BMDc with cardiac involvement demonstrate the same myocardial fibrosis pattern as their male counterparts with overt disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa7ed3cf058f61000b629","authors":["Florian, Anca","R\u00f6sch, Sabine","Bietenbeck, Michael","Engelen, Markus","Stypmann, J\u00f6rg","Waltenberger, Johannes","Sechtem, Udo","Yilmaz, Ali","Anca Florian","Sabine R\u00f6sch","Michael Bietenbeck","Markus Engelen","J\u00f6rg Stypmann","Johannes Waltenberger","Udo Sechtem","Ali Yilmaz"],"doi":"10.1093\/ehjci\/jev161","first_seen_on":"2015-06-27T14:09:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2047-2412"],"journal":"European Heart Journal - Cardiovascular Imaging","last_mentioned_on":1457368885,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26113120?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/ehjci\/jev161","http:\/\/ehjcimaging.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/17\/3\/326.full?etoc"],"pmid":"26113120","pubdate":"2015-06-27T22:02:54+00:00","subjects":["diagnosticimaging","cardiology"],"title":"Cardiac involvement in female Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy carriers in comparison to their first-degree male relatives: a comparative cardiovascular magnetic resonance study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cardiac-involvement-female-duchenne-becker-muscular-dystrophy-carriers-comparison-firstdegree-male-r"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7361309,"mean":6.3962513384811,"rank":1498070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5856461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7361309,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224473,"mean":7.987212703589,"rank":56358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":167852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224473,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":798,"mean":2.5401154328733,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":707,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":798,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":2.3020408163265,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
