Its effects on the electrophysiological characteristics of human STN neurons are largely unknown. We hypothesized that dexmedetomidine modulates the firing rates and bursting of human STN neurons. We analyzed microelectrode recording (MER) data from patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent STN DBS. A 'Dex bolus' group (dexmedetomidine bolus prior to MER, 27 cells from 7 patients) was compared with a 'no sedation' group (29 cells from 11 patients). We also performed within-patient comparisons with varying dexmedetomidine states. Cells were classified as dorsal half or ventral half based on their relative location in the STN. Neuronal burst and oscillation characteristics were analyzed using the Kaneoke-Vitek methodology and local field potential (LFP) oscillatory activity was also interrogated. Dexmedetomidine was associated with a slight increase in firing rate (41.1\u00b19.9 Hz vs. 34.5\u00b110.6 Hz, p = .02) but a significant decrease in burstiness (number of bursts, p = .02; burst index, p < .001; percentage of spike in burst, p = .002) of dorsal but not ventral STN neurons. No associated differences in beta spike oscillations (spike oscillation beta peak, p = .4; signal-to-noise ratio in the beta range for spikes and bursts, p = .3 and p = .5, respectively) and LFP beta power (p = .17) were observed. Since bursting pattern is often used to help identify STN and guide electrode placement, we recommend that high-dose dexmedetomidine should be avoided during DBS surgery.
