Subjects in MESE\u200a+\u200aCa group performed such the combined treatment project for 12 months. Body height and Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) scores of both knees, chronic back pain visual analogue scale scores (VAS), bone mineral density (BMD) at L2 to L4 and the left femoral neck, 3-feet Up and Go Test (3') and one-leg Stance (OLS).In our study, the improvement in chronic back pain of the patients in Ca, MESE, and MESE\u200a+\u200aCa group was better than that in control group. There was 1.9% and 1.7%, 2.3%, and 2.1% net profit in left femoral neck and lumbar BMD after the treatment for 12 months in MESE and MESE\u200a+\u200aCa groups. For the balance capacity, the subjects in MESE and MESE\u200a+\u200aCa groups secured much better performance than those in Ca and control group after the treatment for 12 months (P\u200a<\u200a0.001, P\u200a<\u200a0.001).The treatment of MESE exercise is the most effective for the improvement of the symptom and indexes in postmenopausal women. Importantly, the low attrition and the high exercise compliance indicate that MESE exercise is safe, feasible, and well tolerated by postmenopausal women.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b27","authors":["Liu, Bao-Xin","Chen, Shu-Peng","Li, Yu-Dong","Wang, Ji","Zhang, Bin","Lin, Ying","Guan, Jun-Hui","Cai, Ying-Feng","Liang, Zhu","Zheng, Fang"],"doi":"10.1097\/md.0000000000000991","first_seen_on":"2015-06-27T07:53:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-5964"],"issue":"25","journal":"Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1435391587,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26107684"],"pmid":"26107684","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The Effect of the Modified Eighth Section of Eight-Section Brocade on Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women: A Prospective Randomized Trial.","type":"article","volume":"94","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-modified-eighth-section-eightsection-brocade-osteoporosis-postmenopausal-women"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5281486,"mean":6.2131255898695,"rank":2350804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2872227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5281486,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186287,"mean":8.4428117088779,"rank":80606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":102256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186287,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2642,"mean":2.2558500567967,"rank":592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":1993,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2642,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237,"mean":1.6720254237288,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
