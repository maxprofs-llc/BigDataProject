Guess again! Multiplexed pyrosequencing of 9 mitogenomes"],"citation":{"abstract":"Six complete and three partial actiniarian mitochondrial genomes were amplified in two semi-circles using long-range PCR and pyrosequenced in a single run on a 454 GS Junior, doubling the number of complete mitogenomes available within the order. Typical metazoan mtDNA features included circularity, 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and length ranging from 17,498 to 19,727\u2009bp. Several typical anthozoan mitochondrial genome features were also observed including the presence of only two transfer RNA genes, elevated A\u2009+\u2009T richness ranging from 54.9 to 62.4%, large intergenic regions, and group 1 introns interrupting NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, the latter of which possesses a homing endonuclease gene. Within the sea anemone Alicia sansibarensis, we report the first mitochondrial gene order rearrangement within the Actiniaria, as well as putative novel non-canonical protein-coding genes. Phylogenetic analyses of all 13 protein-coding and 2 ribosomal genes largely corroborated current hypotheses of sea anemone interrelatedness, with a few lower-level differences.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f610004220","authors":["Foox, Jonathan","Brugler, Mercer","Siddall, Mark Edward","Rodr\u00edguez, Estefan\u00eda"],"doi":"10.3109\/19401736.2015.1053114","first_seen_on":"2015-06-25T20:40:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-1744"],"journal":"Mitochondrial DNA: The Journal of DNA Mapping, Sequencing & Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1435445690,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26104159?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/19401736.2015.1053114"],"pmid":"26104159","pubdate":"2015-06-25T22:04:46+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Multiplexed pyrosequencing of nine sea anemone (Cnidaria: Anthozoa: Hexacorallia: Actiniaria) mitochondrial genomes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiplexed-pyrosequencing-nine-sea-anemone-cnidaria-anthozoa-hexacorallia-actiniaria-mitochondrial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5281469,"mean":6.2131062325875,"rank":3499804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1562427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5281469,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186531,"mean":8.4639996890582,"rank":121432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":56249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186531,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1438,"mean":0.71689074460682,"rank":336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":1038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1438,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129,"mean":0.849328125,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
