We hypothesize that lung tumor position will be more consistent using AVBH compared with conventional breath-hold (CBH).\nLung tumor positions were determined for seven lung cancer patients (age: 25 - 74) during to two separate 3T MRI sessions. A breathhold training session was performed prior to the MRI sessions to allow patients to become comfortable with AVBH and their exhale and inhale target positions. CBH and AVBH 4D image datasets were obtained in the first MRI session (pre-treatment) and the second MRI session (midtreatment) within six weeks of the first session. Audio-instruction (MRI: Siemens Skyra) in CBH and verbal-instruction (radiographer) in AVBH were used. A radiation oncologist contoured the lung tumor using Eclipse (Varian Medical Systems); tumor position was quantified as the centroid of the contoured tumor after rigid registration based on vertebral anatomy across two MRI sessions. CBH and AVBH were compared in terms of the reproducibility assessed via (1) the difference between the two exhale positions for the two sessions and the two inhale positions for the sessions. (2) The difference in amplitude (exhale to inhale) between the two sessions.\nCompared to CBH, AVBH improved the reproducibility of two exhale (or inhale) lung tumor positions relative to each other by 33%, from 6.4\u00b15.3 mm to 4.3\u00b13.0 mm (p=0.005). Compared to CBH, AVBH improved the reproducibility of exhale and inhale amplitude by 66%, from 5.6\u00b15.9 mm to 1.9\u00b11.4 mm (p=0.005).\nThis study demonstrated that audiovisual biofeedback can be utilized for improving the reproducibility of breath-hold lung tumor position. These results are advantageous towards achieving more accurate emerging radiation treatment planning methods, in addition to imaging and treatment modalities utilizing breath-hold procedures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000309b","authors":["D Lee","D Lee","P Greer","C Lapuz","J Ludbrook","S Pollock","T Kim","P Keall"],"doi":"10.1118\/1.4924322","first_seen_on":"2015-06-26T23:57:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0094-2405"],"issue":"6","journal":"Medical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1435343281,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aapm\/journal\/medphys\/42\/6\/10.1118\/1.4924322?TRACK=RSS"],"pmid":"26127627","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association of Physicists in Medicine","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"SU-E-J-236: Audiovisual Biofeedback Improves Breath-Hold Lung Tumor Position Reproducibility Measured with 4D MRI","type":"article","volume":"42"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5279944,"mean":6.2124069797745,"rank":4396919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5279944,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186291,"mean":8.4500616565571,"rank":150545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186291,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2164,"mean":1.802631530282,"rank":1858,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2164,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":654,"mean":1.3572741194487,"rank":569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":654,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/medphyspapers\/status\/614500377636012032","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4217833],"posted_on":"2015-06-26T18:28:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Med Phys Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"New publications in Medical Physics and Radiotherapy.","id_on_source":"medphyspapers","tweeter_id":"2879791906","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":137},"tweet_id":"614500377636012032"}]}}
