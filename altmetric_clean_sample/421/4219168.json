Most studies have emphasised the discovery of genetic variation in coding sequences, however, the noncoding regulatory effects responsible for human disease and cancer biology have been substantially understudied. To better characterise the cis-regulatory effects of noncoding variation, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the genetic variants in HOT (high-occupancy target) regions, which are considered to be one of the most intriguing findings of recent large-scale sequencing studies. We observed that GWAS variants that map to HOT regions undergo a substantial net decrease and illustrate development-specific localisation during haematopoiesis. Additionally, genetic risk variants are disproportionally enriched in HOT regions compared with LOT (low-occupancy target) regions in both disease-relevant and cancer cells. Importantly, this enrichment is biased toward disease- or cancer-specific cell types. Furthermore, we observed that cancer cells generally acquire cancer-specific HOT regions at oncogenes through diverse mechanisms of cancer pathogenesis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the key roles of HOT regions in human disease and cancer and represent a critical step toward further understanding disease biology, diagnosis, and therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Li, Hao","Chen, Hebing","Liu, Feng","Ren, Chao","Wang, Shengqi","Bo, Xiaochen","Shu, Wenjie","Hao Li","Hebing Chen","Feng Liu","Chao Ren","Shengqi Wang","Xiaochen Bo","Wenjie Shu"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep11633","first_seen_on":"2015-06-27T10:32:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1435568435,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26113264?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2015\/150626\/srep11633\/full\/srep11633.html","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/srep11633"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep11633.pdf","pmid":"26113264","pubdate":"2015-06-27T22:02:42+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Data integration","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Cancer genetics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Mutation","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Oncogenes","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"srep11633","subjects":["science"],"title":"Functional annotation of HOT regions in the human genome: implications for human disease and cancer","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/functional-annotation-hot-regions-human-genome-implications-human-disease-cancer-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5291770,"mean":6.2217234724363,"rank":2625466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2507348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5291770,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186388,"mean":8.4489690911921,"rank":93656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":84555,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186388,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18019,"mean":13.519294372294,"rank":9378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":7754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18019,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1722,"mean":10.603628123184,"rank":870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":766,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1722,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
