Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (SPSS, Chicago, IL) software.\nA 23-item questionnaire was designed and distributed to 550 physicians in 11 medical facilities in China.\nFive hundred (90.90%) physicians responded. About one-third (32.6%) of physicians assessed patients' pain rarely, and 85.5% never or occasionally treated patients' cancer pain together with psychologists. More than half of physicians indicated that opioid dose titration in patients with poor pain control and assessment of the cause and severity of pain were urgently needed knowledge for cancer pain management. Inadequate assessment of pain and pain management (63.0%), patients' reluctance to take opioids (62.2%), and inadequate staff knowledge of pain management (61.4%) were the three most frequently cited barriers to physicians' pain management.\nPhysicians' positive attitudes toward cancer pain management need to be encouraged, and active professional analgesic education programs are needed to improve pain management in China.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003282","authors":["Zhang, Qiongwen","Yu, Chunhua","Feng, Shijian","Yao, Wenxiu","Shi, Huashan","Zhao, Yuwei","Wang, Yongsheng"],"doi":"10.1111\/pme.12819","endpage":"2203","first_seen_on":"2015-06-27T11:42:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-4637"],"issue":"11","journal":"Pain Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1435405295,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pme.12819\/abstract;jsessionid=145E3ADA9B9D26E7BE1D505433785265.f02t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pme.12819\/pdf","pmid":"26118400","pubdate":"2015-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2195","subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Physicians\u2019 Practice, Attitudes Toward, and Knowledge of Cancer Pain Management in China","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physicians-practice-attitudes-toward-knowledge-cancer-pain-management-china-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6398634,"mean":5.9835624399771,"rank":5450369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6398634,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188211,"mean":8.5235527336486,"rank":150895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188211,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1065,"mean":6.7178759398496,"rank":858,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1065,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":4.7393823529412,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/status\/614760482881179648","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4219358],"posted_on":"2015-06-27T11:41:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":981},"tweet_id":"614760482881179648"}]}}
