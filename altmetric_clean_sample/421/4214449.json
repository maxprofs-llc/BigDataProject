On examination, visual acuity was 20\/20 in each eye. There was oculodermal melanocytosis in the right eye involving the periocular skin, episclera, iris, and choroid. On ophthalmoscopy and ocular ultrasonography, there was no appreciable mass, but subtle subfoveal fluid and perifoveal orange pigment were detected, as well as equatorial drusen. Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography demonstrated a subtle optically dense focal choroidal mass measuring 4.5 mm in basal dimension and 0.7 mm in enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography thickness. There was choroidal vascular compression, obliteration of choroidal details, and related overlying subretinal fluid with shaggy photoreceptors, consistent with early choroidal melanoma in an eye with oculodermal melanocytosis. The patient elected early treatment considering the risk factors for growth and the risk for metastasis associated with melanoma in the setting of oculodermal melanocytosis. Plaque radiotherapy was performed with complete tumor regression clinically and by enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography. At 2-year follow-up, visual acuity remains 20\/20, with regressed tumor and no systemic metastasis.\nEnhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography is a useful tool in the evaluation of eyes with oculodermal melanocytosis, permitting high-resolution visualization of the choroid and detection of submillimeter early melanoma that might not be apparent with indirect ophthalmoscopy or ultrasonography.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6363cf058f610008766","authors":["Daitch, Zachary","Shields, Carol L","Say, Emil A T","Mashayekhi, Arman","Shields, Jerry A"],"doi":"10.1097\/icb.0000000000000162","first_seen_on":"2015-06-26T10:24:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1937-1578","1935-1089"],"issue":"1","journal":"Retinal Cases & Brief Reports","last_mentioned_on":1450469360,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26110523?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/retinalcases\/Abstract\/publishahead\/SUBMILLIMETER_CHOROIDAL_MELANOMA_DETECTION_BY.99400.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/retinalcases\/Abstract\/2016\/01010\/SUBMILLIMETER_CHOROIDAL_MELANOMA_DETECTION_BY.2.aspx"],"pmid":"26110523","pubdate":"2015-06-26T22:01:17+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"title":"SUBMILLIMETER CHOROIDAL MELANOMA DETECTION BY ENHANCED DEPTH IMAGING OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY IN A PATIENT WITH OCULODERMAL MELANOCYTOSIS","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/submillimeter-choroidal-melanoma-detection-enhanced-depth-imaging-optical-coherence-tomography-patie"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6790336,"mean":6.1741602613112,"rank":3079990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3528410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6790336,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222379,"mean":7.8913399976618,"rank":106516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":106136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222379,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256,"mean":0.70385882352941,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.53571428571429,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/merichurchis\/status\/615442659793084416","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4214449],"posted_on":"2015-06-29T08:52:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Mar\u00eda Iglesias","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/583369894521122816\/OprIZznZ_normal.jpg","description":"Barraquer Ophthalmology Center.\nFEBO.
