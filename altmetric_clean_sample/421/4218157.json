Di-Te-Pol vaccine contains aluminium hydroxide. Contact allergy to aluminium was demonstrated in 32 children (20 girls and 12 boys). Of the three patch test methods used, testing with 2% AlCl3 occluded with a Finn Chamber proved to be the most sensitive. Immunization of children who have been shown to be allergic to aluminium should be carried out with vaccines which do not contain aluminium.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd48","authors":["Nielsen, A O","Kaaber, K","Veien, N K"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-27T01:22:17+00:00","issns":["0041-5782"],"issue":"27","journal":"Ugeskrift for laeger","last_mentioned_on":1435368097,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1509548"],"pmid":"1509548","pubdate":"1992-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Aluminum allergy caused by DTP vaccine].","type":"article","volume":"154","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aluminum-allergy-caused-dtp-vaccine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5281486,"mean":6.2131255898695,"rank":2803332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1791929,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5281486,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186287,"mean":8.4428117088779,"rank":102850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":65245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186287,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301,"mean":1.8806333333333,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":2.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DystopianUtopia\/status\/614604464469585920","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4218157],"posted_on":"2015-06-27T01:21:37+00:00","author":{"name":"DystopianUtopia","image":"http:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_2_normal.png","id_on_source":"DystopianUtopia","tweeter_id":"3241559449","followers":2},"tweet_id":"614604464469585920"}]}}
