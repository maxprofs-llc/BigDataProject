Using a DNMS task we compared error trials vs. correct trials and found almost all mPFC cells fired at similar rates during both error and correct trials (92%), however theta-entrainment of mPFC neurons declined during error performance as only 17% of cells were theta-entrained (during correct trials 46% of the population was theta-entrained). Across the population, error and correct trials did not differ in firing rate, but theta-entrainment was impaired. Periods of theta-entrainment and firing rate changes appeared to be independent variables, and only theta-entrainment was correlated with successful performance, indicating mPFC-HPC theta-range interactions are the key to successful DNMS performance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc0f","authors":["Hyman"],"doi":"10.3389\/neuro.07.002.2010","first_seen_on":"2011-08-11T10:06:24+00:00","issns":["16625145"],"journal":"Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1273063817,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2861479\/?tool=pubmed"],"pmid":"20431726","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers Media SA","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Working memory performance correlates with prefrontal-hippocampal theta interactions but not with prefrontal neuron firing rates","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/working-memory-performance-correlates-prefrontalhippocampal-theta-interactions-not-prefrontal-neuron"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626769,"mean":4.9522514062143,"rank":2907348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626769,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55719,"mean":4.6210342438709,"rank":38701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55719,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":306,"mean":5.9208459016393,"rank":280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":306,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":12,"Researcher":33,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
