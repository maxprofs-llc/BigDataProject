GALFACTS observations will create\n\nfull-Stokes image cubes at an angular resolution of 3.5', with several thousand\n\nspectral channels covering 1225 - 1525 MHz, and band-averaged sensitivity of 90\n\nuJy, allowing sensitive imaging of polarized radiation and Faraday Rotation\n\nMeasure from both diffuse emission and against a high density grid of\n\nextragalactic sources. GALFACTS will be a major observational advance in\n\nimaging of the polarized radiation from the Milky Way and will provide a rich\n\nnew database for exploration of the magnetic field of the Galaxy and the\n\nproperties of the magneto-ionic medium.\n\n","ads_id":"2010ASPC..438..402T","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001fae","arxiv_id":"1008.4944","first_seen_on":"2011-08-11T09:49:48+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Society","last_mentioned_on":1283244221,"links":["http:\/\/export.arxiv.org\/api\/query?id_list=1008.4944"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1008.4944v1","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"title":"GALFACTS: The G-ALFA Continuum Transit Survey","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/galfacts-galfa-continuum-transit-survey"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632140,"mean":4.9249633348334,"rank":2898350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632140,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55750,"mean":4.5540137042817,"rank":38094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55750,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":5.3642040816327,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":6.832,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
