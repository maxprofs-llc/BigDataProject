Let X be a finite set, C be a finite cyclic group acting on X, and\n\nf(q) be a polynomial in q with nonnegative integer coefficients. Then the\n\ntriple (X,C,f(q)) exhibits the cyclic sieving phenomenon if, for all g in C, we\n\nhave # X^g = f(w) where # denotes cardinality, X^g is the fixed point set of g,\n\nand w is a root of unity chosen to have the same order as g. It might seem\n\nimprobable that substituting a root of unity into a polynomial with integer\n\ncoefficients would have an enumerative meaning. But many instances of the\n\ncyclic sieving phenomenon have now been found. Furthermore, the proofs that\n\nthis phenomenon hold often involve interesting and sometimes deep results from\n\nrepresentation theory. We will survey the current literature on cyclic sieving,\n\nproviding the necessary background about representations, Coxeter groups, and\n\nother algebraic aspects as needed.\n\n","ads_id":"2010arXiv1008.0790S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a9","arxiv_id":"1008.0790","first_seen_on":"2011-08-11T09:50:30+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Program: Electronic Library & Information Systems","last_mentioned_on":1280989030,"links":["http:\/\/export.arxiv.org\/api\/query?id_list=1008.0790"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1008.0790v3","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"title":"The cyclic sieving phenomenon: a survey","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cyclic-sieving-phenomenon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3624910,"mean":4.93387576623,"rank":2906121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":72660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3624910,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55674,"mean":4.6230077057101,"rank":38708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55674,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":2.4635616438356,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
