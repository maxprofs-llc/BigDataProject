The presence of oxidative stress in the absence of measurable inflammation could help explain this phenomenon. In this study, the assessment of an in vivo marker of oxidative stress, cerebral glutathione (GSH), using magnetic resonance chemical shift imaging (CSI) is described, and GSH levels were compared in patients with SPMS and healthy controls.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000312e","authors":["Choi IY","Lee SP","Denney DR","Lynch SG"],"doi":"10.1177\/1352458510384010","first_seen_on":"2011-08-10T19:23:17+00:00","funders":["phs"],"issns":["1477-0970"],"issue":"3","journal":"Multiple Sclerosis (13524585)","last_mentioned_on":1421438655,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20921235"],"pmid":"20921235","pubdate":"2011-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Lower levels of glutathione in the brains of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patients measured by 1H magnetic resonance chemical shift imaging at 3 T.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lower-levels-glutathione-brains-secondary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-patients-measured-1h-magnet-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4742359,"mean":5.4864603665373,"rank":2452764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1662792,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4742359,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59398,"mean":5.27644830547,"rank":27907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":21020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59398,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1334,"mean":4.3848987246812,"rank":851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1334,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.5726666666667,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
