Here we demonstrate that 2-HG is a competitive inhibitor of multiple \u03b1-KG-dependent dioxygenases, including histone demethylases and the TET family of 5-methlycytosine (5mC) hydroxylases. 2-HG occupies the same space as \u03b1-KG does in the active site of histone demethylases. Ectopic expression of tumor-derived IDH1 and IDH2 mutants inhibits histone demethylation and 5mC hydroxylation. In glioma, IDH1 mutations are associated with increased histone methylation and decreased 5-hydroxylmethylcytosine (5hmC). Hence, tumor-derived IDH1 and IDH2 mutations reduce \u03b1-KG and accumulate an \u03b1-KG antagonist, 2-HG, leading to genome-wide histone and DNA methylation alterations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002496","authors":["Wei Xu","Hui Yang","Ying Liu","Ying Yang","Ping Wang","Se-Hee Kim","Shinsuke Ito","Chen Yang","Pu Wang","Meng-Tao Xiao","Xu W","Yang H","Liu Y","Yang Y","Wang P","Kim SH","Ito S","Yang C","Xiao MT","Liu LX","Jiang WQ","Liu J","Zhang JY","Wang B","Frye S","Zhang Y","Xu YH","Lei QY","Guan KL","Zhao SM","Xiong Y","Li-xia Liu","Wen-qing Jiang","Jing Liu","Jin-ye Zhang","Bin Wang","Stephen Frye","Yi Zhang","Yan-hui Xu","Qun-ying Lei","Kun-Liang Guan","Shi-min Zhao","Yue Xiong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ccr.2010.12.014","endpage":"30","first_seen_on":"2011-08-10T22:20:08+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["15356108","1535-6108"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cancer Cell","last_mentioned_on":1502196744,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/cancer-cell\/retrieve\/pii\/S1535610810005271","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21251613","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3229304","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21251613","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3229304\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3229304","pmid":"21251613","pubdate":"2011-01-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"17","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Oncometabolite 2-Hydroxyglutarate Is a Competitive Inhibitor of \u03b1-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenases","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oncometabolite-2hydroxyglutarate-competitive-inhibitor-%CE%B1ketoglutaratedependent-dioxygenases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.1,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":570721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7771003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74116,"mean":6.1287389057546,"rank":5548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":68561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74116,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1534,"mean":16.890807566862,"rank":352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":1181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1534,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":6.4009333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":7,"Professor > Associate Professor":33,"Student  > Doctoral Student":29,"Researcher":137,"Student  > Ph.
