In particular, a non-trivial topology will generate pairs of\n\ncorrelated circles of temperature fluctuations in the anisotropies maps of the\n\ncosmic microwave background (CMB), the so-called circles-in-the-sky. In this\n\nway, a detectable non-trivial spatial topology may be seen as an observable\n\nattribute, which can be probed through the circles-in-the-sky for all locally\n\nhomogeneous and isotropic universes with no assumptions on the cosmological\n\ndark energy (DE) equation of state (EOS) parameters. We show that the knowledge\n\nof the spatial topology through the circles-in-the-sky offers an effective way\n\nof reducing the degeneracies in the DE EOS parameters. We concretely illustrate\n\nthe topological role by assuming, as an exanple, a Poincar\\'{e} dodecahedral\n\nspace topology and reanalyzing the constraints on the parameters of a specific\n\nEOS which arise from the supernovae type Ia, baryon acoustic oscillations and\n\nthe CMB plus the statistical topological contribution.\n\n","ads_id":"2010ara..conf..219V","altmetric_jid":"arxiv","arxiv_id":"1008.0832","authors":["S.
