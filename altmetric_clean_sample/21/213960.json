In a New England population-based case-control study of urothelial carcinoma, we collected mouthwash samples from 1088 of 1171 cases (92.9%) and 1282 of 1418 controls (91.2%) for genotype analysis of GSTM1, GSTT1 and NAT2 polymorphisms. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of bladder cancer among New England Bladder Cancer Study subjects with one or two inactive GSTM1 alleles (i.e. the 'null' genotype) were 1.26 (0.85-1.88) and 1.54 (1.05-2.25), respectively (P-trend = 0.008), compared with those with two active copies. GSTT1 inactive alleles were not associated with risk. NAT2 slow acetylation status was not associated with risk among never (1.04; 0.71-1.51), former (0.95; 0.75-1.20) or current smokers (1.33; 0.91-1.95); however, a relationship emerged when smoking intensity was evaluated. Among slow acetylators who ever smoked at least 40 cigarettes\/day, risk was elevated among ever (1.82; 1.14-2.91, P-interaction = 0.07) and current heavy smokers (3.16; 1.22-8.19, P-interaction = 0.03) compared with rapid acetylators in each category; but was not observed at lower intensities. In contrast, the effect of GSTM1-null genotype was not greater among smokers, regardless of intensity. Meta-analysis of the NAT2 associations with bladder cancer showed a highly significant relationship. Findings from this large USA population-based study provided evidence that the NAT2 slow acetylation genotype interacts with tobacco smoking as a function of exposure intensity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024a7","authors":["Moore LE","Baris DR","Figueroa JD","Garcia-Closas M","Karagas MR","Schwenn MR","Johnson AT","Lubin JH","Hein DW","Dagnall CL","Colt JS","Kida M","Jones MA","Schned AR","Cherala SS","Chanock SJ","Cantor KP","Silverman DT","Rothman N","L.
