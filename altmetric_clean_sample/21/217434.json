A physically motivated ansatz\n\nfor duality violations in the spectral functions enables us to perform fits to\n\nspectral moments employing both pinched and unpinched weights. We describe our\n\nanalysis strategy and provide some preliminary findings. Final numerical\n\nresults await completion of an ongoing re-determination of the ALEPH covariance\n\nmatrices incorporating correlations due to the unfolding procedure which are\n\nabsent from the currently posted versions. To what extent this issue affects\n\nexisting analyses and our own work will require further study.\n\n","ads_id":"2011NuPhS.218..104B","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5103cf058f6100031fe","arxiv_id":"1011.4426","authors":["D.
