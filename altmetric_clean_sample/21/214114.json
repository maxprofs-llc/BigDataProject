Ingestion of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) by breast cancer patients has been reported to restore the systemic synthesis of maspin through the stimulation of systemic nitric oxide production. Studies were carried out to determine the effect of aspirin on the incidence of breast cancer metastasis, which is reported to occur in 50% of patients who have previously received chemotherapy, radiation, and\/or surgery. Thirty-five female patients (aged 41-65 years) with breast cancer who had previously received these therapies took one 75 mg\/70 kg body weight enteric-coated aspirin tablet every 24 h, after an adequate meal, for 3 years. Their plasma nitric oxide and maspin levels were measured. The occurrence of metastasis was ascertained monthly by a qualified oncologist, and confirmed, if necessary, by biopsy. Daily ingestion of aspirin by participants resulted in an increase in maspin levels from 0.95 \u00b1 0.04 to 4.63 \u00b1 0.05 nM after 24 h. These levels were maintained for 3 years. These studies suggest that daily ingestion of aspirin might significantly reduce the incidence of breast cancer metastasis in patients who have previously received anticancer therapies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd7","authors":["Bhattacharyya, Mau","Girish, Gannareddy V","Ghosh, Rajeshwary","Chakraborty, Somashree","Sinha, Asru K"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1349-7006.2010.01655.x","first_seen_on":"2011-08-10T19:21:56+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1349-7006"],"issue":"10","journal":"Cancer Science","last_mentioned_on":1305368030,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20670296"],"pmid":"20670296","pubdate":"2010-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Acetyl salicylic acid (aspirin) improves synthesis of maspin and lowers incidence of metastasis in breast cancer patients [corrected].","type":"article","volume":"101","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acetyl-salicyclic-acid-aspirin-improves-synthesis-maspin-lowers-incidence-metastasis-breast-cancer-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628172,"mean":4.9437236464363,"rank":2904398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628172,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55688,"mean":4.6144681164365,"rank":38484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55688,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":508,"mean":2.1935660749507,"rank":376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":508,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.51470588235294,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
