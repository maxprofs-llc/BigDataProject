The resulting structures turn out to (1)\n\nencompass many examples of interest, such as categories of relations, partial\n\ninjections, Hilbert spaces (also modulo phase), and Boolean algebras, and (2)\n\nhave interesting categorical\/logical properties, in terms of kernel fibrations,\n\nsuch as existence of pullbacks, factorisation, and orthomodularity. For\n\ninstance, the Sasaki hook and and-then connectives are obtained, as adjoints,\n\nvia the existential-pullback adjunction between fibres.\n\n","ads_id":"2009arXiv0902.2355H","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083f0","arxiv_id":"0902.2355","authors":["Chris Heunen","Bart Jacobs"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11083-010-9145-5","endpage":"212","first_seen_on":"2011-08-11T09:50:48+00:00","issns":["0167-8094","1572-9273"],"issue":"2","journal":"Order","last_mentioned_on":1280988632,"links":["http:\/\/export.arxiv.org\/api\/query?id_list=0902.2355","http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/0902.2355"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/0902.2355v3","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pure Mathematics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Mathematics","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"startpage":"177","title":"Quantum Logic in Dagger Kernel Categories","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s11083-010-9145-5","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantum-logic-dagger-kernel-categories"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628824,"mean":4.9380564480592,"rank":2902002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628824,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55735,"mean":4.5903353787634,"rank":38380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55735,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":4.0090384615385,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
