There is limited knowledge about the effects of age on the predictors of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), a key feature of asthma. The aim of this study was to determine if the pathophysiologic predictors of AHR, including inflammation, ventilation heterogeneity, and airway closure, differed between young and old patients with asthma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024fa","authors":["K.
