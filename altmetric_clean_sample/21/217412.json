If this is not a hugely\n\nimprobable accident, or a consequence of some mysterious logical necessity or\n\nof some simple principle of physics, it might be explained as a consequence\n\neither of an observership selection principle within a multiverse of many sets\n\nof effective coupling constants, or else of some biophilic principle that fine\n\ntunes the constants of physics to optimize life. Here a very preliminary\n\ninconclusive hint of evidence is presented against the hypothesis of optimal\n\nfine tuning of the cosmological constant by a biophilic principle that would\n\nmaximize the fraction of baryons that form living organisms or observers.\n\n","ads_id":"2011arXiv1101.2444P","altmetric_jid":"arxiv","arxiv_id":"1101.2444","authors":["Don N.
