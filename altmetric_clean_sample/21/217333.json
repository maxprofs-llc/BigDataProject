Cases which\n\nhave been claimed as successful predictions from the AP are shown to be not\n\nthat. Either they are uncontroversial applications of selection principles in\n\none universe (as in Dicke's argument), or the predictions made do not actually\n\nlogically depend on any assumption about life or intelligence, but instead\n\ndepend only on arguments from observed facts (as in the case of arguments by\n\nHoyle and Weinberg). The Principle of Mediocrity is also examined and shown to\n\nbe unreliable, as arguments for factually true conclusions can easily be\n\nmodified to lead to false conclusions by reasonable changes in the\n\nspecification of the ensemble in which we are assumed to be typical.\n\n  We show however that it is still possible to make falsifiable predictions\n\nfrom theories of multiverses, if the ensemble predicted has certain properties\n\nspecified here. An example of such a falsifiable multiverse theory is\n\ncosmological natural selection. It is reviewed here and it is argued that the\n\ntheory remains unfalsified. But it is very vulnerable to falsification by\n\ncurrent observations, which shows that it is a scientific theory.\n\n  The consequences for recent discussions of the AP in the context of string\n\ntheory are discussed.\n\n","ads_id":"2004hep.th....7213S","altmetric_jid":"arxiv","arxiv_id":"hep-th\/0407213","first_seen_on":"2011-08-11T09:40:41+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"arXiv","last_mentioned_on":1424401860,"links":["http:\/\/export.arxiv.org\/api\/query?id_list=hep-th\/0407213","http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/hep-th\/0407213"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/hep-th\/0407213v3","pubdate":"2004-07-26T18:25:49+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Scientific alternatives to the anthropic principle","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/scientific-alternatives-anthropic-principle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7897198,"mean":6.6845833211397,"rank":3912391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3784136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7897198,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72714,"mean":5.8763022018071,"rank":35552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":35231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72714,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":441117,"mean":2.7121761441436,"rank":116212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":303966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":441117,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2636,"mean":2.6379074003795,"rank":726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":1822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2636,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
