The vacuum is represented by a thermodynamic\n\nequilibrium state in the low-temperature limit. All regularization is\n\nconsistently provided by a friction mechanism; with decreasing friction\n\nparameter, only degrees of freedom on shorter and shorter length scales are\n\ndamped out of a quantum field theory. No divergent integrals need to be\n\nmanipulated. Renormalization occurs as a tool to refine perturbation\n\nexpansions, not to remove divergences. Relativistic covariance is recovered in\n\nthe final results. We illustrate the proposed thermodynamic approach to quantum\n\nfields for the phi^4 theory by calculating the propagator and the beta\n\nfunction, and we offer some suggestions on its application to gauge theories.\n\n","ads_id":"2011PhRvD..84f5007O","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008517","arxiv_id":"1008.1867","authors":["Hans Christian \u00d6ttinger"],"doi":"10.1103\/physrevd.84.065007","first_seen_on":"2011-08-11T09:49:56+00:00","issns":["1550-7998","1550-2368"],"issue":"6","journal":"Physical Review D: Particles Fields Gravitation and Cosmology","last_mentioned_on":1281600386,"links":["http:\/\/export.arxiv.org\/api\/query?id_list=1008.1867","http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1008.1867"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1008.1867v2","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Physical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Astronomical And Space Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atomic, Molecular, Nuclear, Particle And Plasma Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Quantum Physics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Dynamic coarse-graining approach to quantum field theory","type":"article","volume":"84","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dynamic-coarsegraining-approach-quantum-field-theory"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628014,"mean":4.9445414826282,"rank":2904796,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628014,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55730,"mean":4.6053155089809,"rank":38542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55730,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1018,"mean":2.0812881022616,"rank":441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1018,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Physics and Astronomy":1}}}},"posts":{"reddit":[{"title":"[1008.1867] Dynamic coarse-graining approach to quantum field theory","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/silky\/comments\/d09xl\/10081867_dynamic_coarsegraining_approach_to\/","citation_ids":[217650],"posted_on":"2010-08-12T08:06:26+00:00","author":{"name":"grapecigar","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/silky","id_on_source":"silky","followers":104,"subreddit":"a reddit to discuss things of interest"}}]}}
