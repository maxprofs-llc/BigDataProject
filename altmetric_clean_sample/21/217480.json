Such a conception allows to suggest a\n\nreasonable physical model that is based on the conjecture that Matter is some\n\nanalogue of computer (more correct - of a [huge] number of mutually\n\ncomparatively independent automata). The conjecture, in turn, allows\n\nintroducing in the model the basic logical elements that constitute the\n\nmaterial structures and support the informational exchange - i.e. the forces -\n\nbetween the structures. The model yet now makes more clear a number of basic\n\nproblems in special relativity, quantum mechanics, and, rather probably, in\n\n[now - in Newtonian] gravity. In this paper some possible experiments for the\n\nmodel testing are considered.\n\n","ads_id":"2007arXiv0706.3979S","altmetric_jid":"arxiv","arxiv_id":"0706.3979","first_seen_on":"2011-08-11T09:47:37+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"arXiv","last_mentioned_on":1289520849,"links":["http:\/\/export.arxiv.org\/api\/query?id_list=0706.3979"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/0706.3979v3","pubdate":"2007-06-27T08:32:13+00:00","title":"The informational model - possible tests","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/informational-model-possible-tests"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627006,"mean":4.9509722374284,"rank":2907002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627006,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55721,"mean":4.6188798994975,"rank":38684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55721,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222263,"mean":2.7685137630365,"rank":195134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222263,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":3.0833333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"reddit":[{"title":"[0706.3979] The informational model - possible tests","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/silky\/comments\/e4v62\/07063979_the_informational_model_possible_tests\/","citation_ids":[217480],"posted_on":"2010-11-12T00:14:09+00:00","author":{"name":"grapecigar","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/silky","id_on_source":"silky","followers":104,"subreddit":"a reddit to discuss things of interest"}}]}}
