Here we present a delivery method based on light-activated disruption of intracellular vesicles after internalization of biofunctionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with cargo. This method combines the power of targeted delivery with the spatiotemporal control of light activation. As an example, we delivered a cell-impermeable fluorescent compound exclusively to the cytosol of multidrug resistant cancer cells in a mixed population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2010NanoL..10.2211F","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Se\u0301bastien Febvay","Davide M.
