The disease starts in the bone marrow and then expands to peripheral areas, which is typical of M5 leukemogenesis, where high leukemic burden in blood is coincident with symptoms\/mortality. The leukemic cells in the mice had myeloid morphology, phenotypes, and genotypes (including the internal tandem duplication of FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor 3 gene [FLT3-ITD]) similar to those of the original patient. Autocrine mechanisms of human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor\/interleukin-3likely support AM7577 growth in mice. Treatment with FLT-3 TKI (AC220) caused complete remission in peripheral blood, spleen, and bone, along with relief of symptoms and extended life, hinting that FLT-3-ITD may be a key leukemogenic driver maintaining the disease. Interestingly, withdrawal of AC220 (high dose) did not result in relapse of disease, suggesting cure. These results, however, are in contrast to cytarabine (AraC) induction treatment: First, although AraC significantly suppresses the diseases in blood, and to a lesser degree in bone marrow and spleen, the suppression is temporary and does not prevent eventual onset of disease\/death. Second, the withdrawal of AraC always resulted in rapid relapse in peripheral blood and eventually death. Our observation in this patient-derived model may provide useful information for clinical applications of the two drugs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002895","authors":["Xiaoyu An","Jinping Liu","Na Wang","Di Wang","Liang Huang","Likun Zhang","Jie Cai","Jean-Pierre Wery","Demin Zhou","Jianfeng Zhou","Qi-Xiang Li"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.exphem.2016.09.004","first_seen_on":"2017-03-27T16:23:12+00:00","issns":["0301472X"],"journal":"Experimental Hematology","last_mentioned_on":1503591781,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0301472X16306142"],"pmid":"27670587","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"AC220 and AraC cause differential inhibitory dynamics in patient-derived M5-AML with FLT3-ITD and, thus, ultimately distinct therapeutic outcomes","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0301472X16306142","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ac220-arac-cause-differential-inhibitory-dynamics-patientderived-m5aml-flt3itd-ultimately-distinct-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":6391252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1144427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248314,"mean":13.250834309923,"rank":178261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248314,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":494,"mean":2.7547464503043,"rank":349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":494,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.1916666666667,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/crownbioscience\/statuses\/846397149701160960","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18170286],"posted_on":"2017-03-27T16:23:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Crown Bioscience","url":"http:\/\/www.crownbio.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/721384781582180352\/jCGPmMII_normal.jpg","description":"We are the scientists and marketeers at CrownBio sharing the latest advances, articles, and blogs about Oncology & CVMD Drug Discovery.","id_on_source":"crownbioscience","tweeter_id":"156671800","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":14148},"tweet_id":"846397149701160960"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/crownbioscience\/statuses\/900755331969499136","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18170286],"posted_on":"2017-08-24T16:23:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Crown Bioscience","url":"http:\/\/www.crownbio.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/721384781582180352\/jCGPmMII_normal.jpg","description":"We are the scientists and marketeers at CrownBio sharing the latest advances, articles, and blogs about Oncology & CVMD Drug Discovery.","id_on_source":"crownbioscience","tweeter_id":"156671800","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":14148},"tweet_id":"900755331969499136"}]}}
