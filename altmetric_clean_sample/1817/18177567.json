This case-control study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these two approaches for the expanded resection of middle-late tongue cancer.\nA total of 56 matched patients with resectable middle-late squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue body were consecutively hospitalized for expanded resection using the MLR (n\u00a0=\u00a026) or MS approach (n\u00a0=\u00a030) between March 2004 and November 2012. Main outcome measures consisted of tumor exposure, surgical morbidity, maxillofacial motor-sensory return, and head\/neck-specific quality of life.\nThe two approaches achieved similar en bloc R0 resection with similar tumor exposure. The MLR approach was associated with a significantly lower frequency of maxillofacial pain (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and no incidence of mandible nonunion. The MLR approach was also associated with a significantly better quality of life with respect to local pain, facial appearance, and mood.\nCompared to the MS approach, the MLR approach was associated with significantly less surgical morbidity and a significantly better quality of life for middle-late tongue cancer patients undergoing expanded resection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f62","authors":["Hua Li","Jinzhong Li","Bin Yang","Ming Su","Rudong Xing","Zhengxue Han"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jcms.2015.05.008","first_seen_on":"2017-03-28T00:35:33+00:00","issns":["10105182"],"journal":"Journal of Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1490585932,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1010518215001511"],"pmid":"26116305","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Mandibular lingual release versus mandibular lip-split approach for expanded resection of middle\u2013late tongue cancer: A case-control study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1010518215001511","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mandibular-lingual-release-versus-mandibular-lipsplit-approach-expanded-resection-middlelate-tongue"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":7278453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248250,"mean":13.251869655063,"rank":205450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248250,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":434,"mean":1.5287113163972,"rank":292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":434,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":0.975,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
