The programmed death-1\/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1\/PD-L1) pathway plays an important role in immune evasion of tumor cells through T-cell exhaustion. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression of PD-L1 and PD-1 molecules in NNKTL. We detected the expression of PD-L1 in biopsy samples from all of the NNKTL patients studied. PD-L1 was found on both malignant cells and tumor-infiltrating macrophages, while PD-1-positive mononuclear cells infiltrated the tumor tissues in 36% of patients. Most significantly, soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) was present in sera of NNKTL patients at higher levels as compared to healthy individuals and the levels of serum sPD-L1 in patients positively correlated with the expression of PD-L1 in lymphoma cells of tumor tissues. In addition, the high-sPD-L1 group of patients showed significantly worse prognosis than the low-sPD-L1 group. Furthermore, we confirmed that membrane and soluble PD-L1 was expressed on the surface and in the culture supernatant, respectively, of NNKTL cell lines. The expression of PD-L1 was observed in tumor tissues and sera from a murine xenograft model inoculated with an NNKTL cell line. Our results suggest that sPD-L1 could be a prognostic predictor for NNKTL and open up the possibility of immunotherapy of this lymphoma using PD-1\/PD-L1 axis inhibitors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000249d","authors":["Toshihiro Nagato","Takayuki Ohkuri","Kenzo Ohara","Yui Hirata","Kan Kishibe","Yuki Komabayashi","Seigo Ueda","Miki Takahara","Takumi Kumai","Kei Ishibashi","Akemi Kosaka","Naoko Aoki","Kensuke Oikawa","Yuji Uno","Naoko Akiyama","Masatoshi Sado","Hidehiro Takei","Esteban Celis","Yasuaki Harabuchi","Hiroya Kobayashi"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00262-017-1987-x","first_seen_on":"2017-03-27T17:24:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0340-7004","1432-0851"],"journal":"Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1490912526,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00262-017-1987-x","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28349165?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00262-017-1987-x.pdf","pmid":"28349165","pubdate":"2017-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Programmed death-ligand 1 and its soluble form are highly expressed in nasal natural killer\/T-cell lymphoma: a potential rationale for immunotherapy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/programmed-deathligand-1-soluble-form-highly-expressed-nasal-natural-killertcell-lymphoma-potential-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":4007722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4241214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248643,"mean":13.256484375125,"rank":119065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":122252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248643,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":709,"mean":4.6528248587571,"rank":243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":709,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":2.8949056603774,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Ph.
