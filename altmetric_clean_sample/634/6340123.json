Clinical data have demonstrated early peaks of hazards for recurrence and emphasized the relationship of these to peri-operative events. More recently, clinical trial data with surgical oophorectomy at different times in the menstrual cycle, peri-operative progesterone, and anti-inflammatory drugs suggest that interventional studies are particularly well justified, given the increasing recognition of the costs both financially and clinically of current systemic regimens.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006cf8","authors":["Love, Richard R","Love, Susan M"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10549-016-3762-7","first_seen_on":"2016-03-26T11:49:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-7217","0167-6806"],"journal":"Breast Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1458987729,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27013472?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27013472","pubdate":"2016-03-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Peri-operative biology in primary breast cancer: a credible therapeutic target","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/perioperative-biology-primary-breast-cancer-credible-therapeutic-target"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7441664,"mean":6.4677569293272,"rank":6445548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7441664,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276432,"mean":11.011795616266,"rank":233911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276432,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1727,"mean":5.4454530706837,"rank":1452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1727,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":2.2031818181818,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/713672379386343424","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6340123],"posted_on":"2016-03-26T10:22:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"713672379386343424"}]}}
