This inflammation has been linked to several chronic diseases including cancer, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. Major biomarkers of inflammation include tumor necrosis factor, interleukins (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, chemokines, cyclooxygenase, 5-lipooxygenase, and C-reactive protein, all of which are regulated by the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB. Although examining inflammatory biomarkers in blood is a standard practice, its identification in saliva and\/or urine is more convenient and non-invasive. In this review, we aim to (1) discuss the detection of these inflammatory biomarkers in urine and saliva; (2) advantages of using salivary and urinary inflammatory biomarkers over blood, while also weighing on the challenges and\/or limitations of their use; (3) examine their role(s) in connection with diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and drug development for several chronic diseases with inflammatory consequences, including cancer; and (4) explore the use of innovative salivary and urine based biosensor strategies that may permit the testing of biomarkers quickly, reliably, and cost-effectively, in a decentralized setting.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073b7","authors":["Prasad, Sahdeo","Tyagi, Amit K","Aggarwal, Bharat B","Sahdeo Prasad","Amit K Tyagi","Bharat B Aggarwal"],"doi":"10.1177\/1535370216638770","first_seen_on":"2016-03-26T12:09:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1535-3699","1535-3702"],"journal":"Experimental Biology and Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1458991144,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27013544?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27013544","pubdate":"2016-03-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology","physiology"],"title":"Detection of inflammatory biomarkers in saliva and urine: Potential in diagnosis, prevention, and treatment for chronic diseases","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/1535370216638770","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detection-inflammatory-biomarkers-saliva-urine-potential-diagnosis-prevention-treatment-chronic-dise"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7441664,"mean":6.4677569293272,"rank":3828259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2083115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7441664,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276432,"mean":11.011837398844,"rank":150472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":97853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276432,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1189,"mean":4.1541548821549,"rank":852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1189,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":2.222972972973,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
