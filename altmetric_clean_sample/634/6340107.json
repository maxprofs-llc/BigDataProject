We validated TetRP by confirming the translation start sites of protein-coding genes in accordance with the 2006 version ofEscherichia coliK-12 annotation record (GenBankU000962) and found \u223c150 new start sites within 60 nucleotides of the annotated site. This analysis revealed 72 per cent of the genes whose initiation site annotations were changed from the 2006 GenBank record to the newer 2014 annotation record (GenBankU000963), indicating a high sensitivity. Also, results from reporter fusion and proteomics of N-terminally enriched peptides showed high specificity of the TetRP results. In addition, we discovered over 300 translation start sites within non-coding, intergenic regions of the genome, using a threshold that retains \u223c2,000 known coding genes. While some appear to correspond to pseudogenes, others may encode small peptides or have previously unforeseen roles. In summary, we showed that ribosome profiling upon translation inhibition by tetracycline offers a simple, reliable and comprehensive experimental tool for precise annotation of translation start sites of expressed genes in bacteria.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007156","authors":["Nakahigashi, Kenji","Takai, Yuki","Kimura, Michiko","Abe, Nozomi","Nakayashiki, Toru","Shiwa, Yuh","Yoshikawa, Hirofumi","Wanner, Barry L","Ishihama, Yasushi","Mori, Hirotada"],"doi":"10.1093\/dnares\/dsw008","first_seen_on":"2016-03-26T11:49:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1756-1663","1340-2838"],"journal":"DNA Research","last_mentioned_on":1458987727,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27013550?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27013550","pubdate":"2016-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"dsw008","subjects":["molecularbiology","genetics"],"title":"Comprehensive identification of translation start sites by tetracycline-inhibited ribosome profiling","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comprehensive-identification-translation-start-sites-tetracyclineinhibited-ribosome-profiling"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7441664,"mean":6.4677569293272,"rank":5631365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":996089,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7441664,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276432,"mean":11.011792903111,"rank":194342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276432,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318,"mean":4.1091293375394,"rank":270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":11.657272727273,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
