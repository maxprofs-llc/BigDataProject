The aim of the current study was to determine concentrations of mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and a metalloid arsenic (As) found in the species of most consumed fish species by citizens of Bogota D.C. (Colombia), and the consequent potential risk to human health was also calculated. Muscle samples of 8 fish species were obtained from 203 individuals collected through 2014. The highest metal concentrations detected were as follows: Pb in Oncorhynchus sp. (0.0595 mg\/kg), Cd and Hg in Pimelodus sp. (0.0072 and 0.0579 mg\/kg, respectively), and As in Scomberomorus sp (0.0471 mg\/kg). Further, the levels of metal accumulation from consumption of fish were calculated utilizing the metal pollution index (MPI), with elevated values noted in Pseudoplatystoma sp (0.06 mg\/kg), followed by Scomberomorus sp. and Centropomus sp. (0.05 and 0.04 mg\/kg, respectively). The multiple species exposure index (Em.j) denotes the level of exposure associated with consumption of various contaminated fish species, and this level occurred in decreasing order as follows: As > Pb > Cd > Hg. The multiple chemical exposure index (Ej.m), which accounts for exposure to multiple metals, identified Prochilodus sp. as the species displaying the highest level of exposure per consumption (8 \u00d7 10(-6) mg\/kg-d). The target hazard quotient (THQ) for human health indicated high levels for Hg and Cd in Prochilodus sp. (0.026 and 0.005, respectively), Pb in Oncorhynchus sp (0.025), and As in Pseudoplatistoma sp. and Centropomus sp. (0.023). Data emphasize the need for adequate nationwide public policies that promote assessment of exposure levels and potential adverse health risks associated with dietary consumption of different fish species in Colombia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001198","authors":["Ellie Anne L\u00f3pez-Barrera","L\u00f3pez-Barrera, Ellie Anne","Barrag\u00e1n-Gonzalez, Rafael G"],"doi":"10.1080\/15287394.2016.1149130","endpage":"12","first_seen_on":"2016-03-26T22:12:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1528-7394","1087-2620"],"journal":"Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A","last_mentioned_on":1458955714,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/15287394.2016.1149130","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/15287394.2016.1149130"],"pmid":"27010256","pubdate":"2016-03-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Metals and Metalloid in Eight Fish Species Consumed by Citizens of Bogota D.C., Colombia, and Potential Risk to Humans","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metals-metalloid-eight-fish-species-consumed-citizens-bogota-dc-colombia-potential-risk-humans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7441664,"mean":6.4677569293272,"rank":6445505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7441664,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276432,"mean":11.011794711881,"rank":233901,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276432,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":777,"mean":7.7767731958763,"rank":712,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":777,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.5,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
