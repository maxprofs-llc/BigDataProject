For each single patient, the time span until recurrence of seizures was analyzed after an index seizure with and without in-MDZ application. To prevent potential bias, we defined the first seizure with application of in-MDZ as the in-MDZ index seizure. The control index seizure was the preceding, alternatively the next successive seizure without application of in-MDZ.\nIn total, 75 epilepsy patients (mean age 34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.7\u00a0years; 42 male, 33 female) were treated with in-MDZ (mean dose 5.1\u00a0mg). Adverse events were observed in four patients (5.3%), and no serious adverse events occurred. The median time after EEG seizure onset before administration of in-MDZ was 2.17\u00a0min (interquartile range [IQR] 03.82; range 0.13-15.0 min). Over the next 12\u00a0h after in-MDZ, the number of seizures was significantly lower (p\u00a0=\u00a00.031). The median seizure-free interval was significantly longer following treatment with in-MDZ (5.83\u00a0h; IQR 6.83, range 0.4-23.87) than it was for those with no in-MDZ treatment (2.37\u00a0h; IQR 4.87, range 0.03-21.87; p\u00a0=\u00a00.015). Conversely, the likelihood of the patient developing a subsequent seizure was four times higher (odds ratio [OR] 4.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-14.47) in the first hour and decreased gradually after 12\u00a0h (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.06-2.12). The occurrence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures was lower in the in-MDZ group in the 24-h observation period (OR 4.67, 95% CI 1.41-15.45; p\u00a0=\u00a00.009).\nIctal and immediate postictal administration of in-MDZ was well tolerated and not associated with serious adverse events. We demonstrated a significant reduction of subsequent seizures (all seizure types) for a 12\u00a0h period and of generalized tonic-clonic seizures for 24\u00a0h following in-MDZ.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f4","authors":["Kay, Lara","Reif, Philipp S.","Belke, Marcus","Bauer, Sebastian","Fr\u00fcnd, Detlef","Knake, Susanne","Rosenow, Felix","Strzelczyk, Adam","Reif, Philipp S"],"doi":"10.1111\/epi.13088","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2015-07-27T09:59:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1528-1167"],"issue":"9","journal":"Epilepsia (Series 4)","last_mentioned_on":1448882736,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/epi.13088\/abstract;jsessionid=658701B31463B194AFD387F6816FD6D4.f02t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/epi.13088\/abstract;jsessionid=E0C87357D377B468527ABD4D8256B210.f02t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/epi.13088\/abstract;jsessionid=CD64CA34EAD3304DAB8B48CD755F0737.f03t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/epi.13088\/abstract;jsessionid=AAF0FF89B36015A4E812F47D2EFEDC2F.f01t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/epi.13088\/abstract;jsessionid=35B22E121CCAE67A271804F2AF09D317.f03t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/epi.13088\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/epi.13088\/abstract;jsessionid=7345C64399C093AD2C84D1745F9E96AF.f01t02","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/epi.13088","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1111\/epi.13088?hootPostID=1f7c8bf3f7528c3cd140f6c92c0feb18","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1111\/epi.13088?hootPostID=ab3eef9dbff32d65a9f754025011bda8","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1111\/epi.13088?hootPostID=5da5e2c95c556f04b530a4dfc53605bd"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/epi.13088\/pdf","pmid":"26216711","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["brain","neurology"],"title":"Intranasal midazolam during presurgical epilepsy monitoring is well tolerated, delays seizure recurrence, and protects from generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intranasal-midazolam-during-presurgical-epilepsy-monitoring-tolerated-delays-seizure-recurrence-prot"},"altmetric_score":{"score":27.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":27.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7711702,"mean":6.6147835493025,"rank":282186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":7429208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7711702,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227360,"mean":8.2591353938043,"rank":12248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":215098,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227360,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2594,"mean":5.2649625915927,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":2521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2594,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":9.9687659574468,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":3,"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":2,"ES":1},"mendeley":{"ET":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NatRevNeurol\/status\/625606281223634944","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4332026],"posted_on":"2015-07-27T09:58:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Nat Rev Neurology","url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrneurol\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1629167444\/nrneurol_Twitter_logo_normal.jpg","description":"Nature Reviews Neurology is a clinical review journal from Nature Publishing Group.
