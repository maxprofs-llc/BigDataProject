The results showed that commercial rice wine extracts of A. fistulosum contained 28.3-95.9\u03bcL\/mL allicin and exhibited significant antioxidant and antibacterial activities. The DPPH radical scavenging capacity ranged from 90.2% to 52.1%, and the IC50 value ranged from 14.6 to 26.0\u03bcg\/mL. The total phenolic content of wine extracts was 56.4-198.9mg GAE\/g extracts. The TEAC assay of extracts ranged from 6.2 to 15.5mmol\/g extracts. Antibacterial activities were tested against 4 bacteria by using agar disc diffusion and tube dilution tests. All extracts exhibited antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, and gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, A. fistulosum wine extracts could be used as natural and functional additives in cooking foods.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f5","authors":["Chang, Tsan-Chang","Jang, Hung-Der","Lin, Wang-De","Duan, Peng-Fu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.foodchem.2015.06.019","first_seen_on":"2015-07-28T13:28:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0308-8146"],"journal":"Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1438090083,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26213031?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26213031","pubdate":"2015-07-28T22:00:45+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of commercial rice wine extracts of Taiwanese Allium fistulosum.","type":"article","volume":"190","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antioxidant-antimicrobial-activities-commercial-rice-wine-extracts-taiwanese-allium-fistulosum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5422321,"mean":6.3134805950221,"rank":2879999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1842841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5422321,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189281,"mean":8.7062840553678,"rank":103473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":67302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189281,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2623,"mean":3.2366216628528,"rank":1044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":1237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2623,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":2.8212134831461,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
