Therefore, we sought to evaluate the time-dependent changes in platelet reactivity to aspirin during the acute stage after ischemic stroke and the clinical implications of variable patient responses to aspirin in acute ischemic stroke.\nWe conducted a single-center, prospective, observational study. The acute aspirin reaction unit (ARU) was measured after 3 hours of aspirin loading, with higher values indicating increased platelet reactivity despite aspirin therapy. The follow-up ARU was measured on the fifth day of consecutive aspirin intake. The numeric difference between the follow-up ARU and the acute ARU was defined as \u2206ARU and was stratified into quartiles. Early neurological deterioration was regarded as an early clinical outcome.\nBoth the acute ARU (476\u00b169 IU) and the follow-up ARU (451\u00b168 IU) were measured in 349 patients in this study. Early neurological deterioration was observed in 72 patients (20.6%). Changes in aspirin platelet reactivity over time showed an approximately Gaussian distribution. The highest \u2206ARU quartile was independently associated with early neurological deterioration (odds ratio, 3.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.43-7.10; P=0.005) by multivariate logistic regression analysis.\nThe results of our study showed that the increase in platelet reactivity to aspirin over time is independently associated with early neurological deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke. In addition, during the acute stage of ischemic stroke, serial platelet reactivity assays may be more useful than a single assay for identifying the clinical implications of aspirin platelet reactivity after ischemic stroke.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005cfc","authors":["Joon-Tae Kim","Suk-Hee Heo","Kang-Ho Choi","Tai-Seung Nam","Seong-Min Choi","Seung-Han Lee","Man-Seok Park","Byeong C.
