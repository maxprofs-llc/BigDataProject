Targeting silence survivin gene may provide an important approach for patient with ovarian cancer. However, UTMD mediated RNAi therapy typically uses non-targeted microbubbles with suboptimal gene transfection efficiency. In this work, a LHRHa targeted microbubble agent and recombinant expression plasmid of shRNA targeting survivin gene(pshRNA survivin) were constructed for UTMD mediated pshRNA survivin therapy in ovarian cancer A2780\/DDP cells that express LHRH receptor. The targeted microbubbles (TMBs) mixed with the pshRNA survivin were added to cultured ovarian cancer cells followed by ultrasound exposure (1 MHz, 0.5 W\/cm2) for 30 s. After transfected for 48 h, the expression of survivin mRNA and protein were (0.36\u00b10.036) and (0.05\u00b10.02), respectively. The cell survival rate at 24h\u300148h\u300172h after treatment are (42.08\u00b13.20)%\uff0c\uff0854.60\u00b11.02\uff09% and \uff0874.25\u00b12.14\uff09%\uff0crespectively, the apoptosis rate was (28.99\u00b12.70)%. The expression of apoptosis related protein caspase-9 and caspase-3 were (0.95\u00b10.09) and (2.6\u00b10.21). In comparison with the other treatment groups, ultrasound mediation of targeted microbubbles yielded higher RNAi efficiency and higher cell apoptosis rate and cell inhibition rate (p < 0.05). Our experiment verifies the hypothesis that ultrasound mediation of targeted microbubbles will enhance RNAi efficiency in ovarian cancer cells. This novel method for RNA interference represents a powerful, promising nonviral technology that can be used in the tumor gene therapy and research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c9","authors":["Zhang, Yong","Chang, Shufang","Sun, Jiangchuan","Zhu, Shenyin","Pu, Caixiu","Li, Yaowei","Zhu, Yi","Wang, Zhigang","Xu, Ronald X"],"doi":"10.1021\/mp500835z","first_seen_on":"2015-07-28T10:06:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1543-8392"],"journal":"Molecular Pharmaceutics","last_mentioned_on":1438078174,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26212628?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26212628","pubdate":"2015-07-28T22:00:53+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","pharmacology"],"title":"Targeted microbubbles for ultrasound mediated short hairpin RNA plasmid transfection to inhibit survivin gene expression and induce apoptosis of ovarian cancer A2780\/DDP cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeted-microbubbles-ultrasound-mediated-short-hairpin-rna-plasmid-transfection-inhibit-survivin-ge"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5422321,"mean":6.3134805950221,"rank":2691776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2567391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5422321,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189281,"mean":8.7062740173289,"rank":94028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":86923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189281,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":856,"mean":5.0392187134503,"rank":306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":856,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.205,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
