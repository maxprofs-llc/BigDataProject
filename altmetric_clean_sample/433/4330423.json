The average diagnostic yield of the CMA test is known to be about 12.2%, while that of conventional G-banding karyotype is below 3%. This study aimed to assess the usefulness of CMA for the purpose of clinical diagnostic testing in the Korean population.\nWe performed CMA and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) tests in 96 patients with normal karyotype and unexplained DD, MR, or ASD. The CMA was conducted with CytoScan 750K array (Affymetrix, USA) with an average resolution of 100 kb.\nPathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) were detected in 15 patients by CMA and in two patients by MLPA for four known microdeletion syndromes (Prader-Willi\/Angelman syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, Miller-Dieker syndrome and Williams syndrome) designated by National Health Insurance system in Korea. The diagnostic yield was 15.6% and 2.1%, respectively. Thirteen (13.5%) patients (excluding cases with pathogenic CNVs) had variants of uncertain clinical significance. There was one patient with a 17.1-megabase (Mb) region of homozygosity on chromosome 4q.\nOur findings suggest the necessity of CMA as a routine diagnostic test for unexplained DD, MR, and ASD in Korea.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbcd","authors":["Shin, Saeam","Yu, Nae","Choi, Jong Rak","Jeong, Seri","Lee, Kyung A"],"doi":"10.3343\/alm.2015.35.5.510","first_seen_on":"2015-07-26T17:37:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2234-3814"],"issue":"5","journal":"Annals of Laboratory Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1437932268,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26206688?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26206688","pubdate":"2015-07-26T22:01:31+00:00","subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Routine Chromosomal Microarray Analysis is Necessary in Korean Patients With Unexplained Developmental Delay\/Mental Retardation\/Autism Spectrum Disorder.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/routine-chromosomal-microarray-analysis-necessary-korean-patients-unexplained-developmental-delaymen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5402367,"mean":6.3006509303529,"rank":3801207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":908060,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5402367,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189221,"mean":8.7302118380722,"rank":131151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":37306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189221,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":1.0034137931034,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.45,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
