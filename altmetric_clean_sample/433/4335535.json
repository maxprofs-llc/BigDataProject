Ideal strategies for combating these diseases must balance the advantages and disadvantages of 'vertical' disease control programs and 'horizontal' capacity-building approaches. DISCUSSION: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) represents an important step forward in the struggle against these pathogens. While its goals are laudable, significant barriers persist. Most significant is the pitiful lack of funds committed by world governments, particularly those of the very G8 countries whose discussions gave rise to the Fund. A drastic scaling up of resources is the first clear requirement for the GFATM to live up to the international community's lofty intentions. A directly related issue is that of maintaining a strong commitment to the treatment of the three diseases along with traditional prevention approaches, with the ensuing debates over providing affordable access to medications in the face of the pharmaceutical industry's vigorous protection of patent rights. SUMMARY: At this early point in the Fund's history, it remains to be seen how these issues will be resolved at the programming level. Nevertheless, it is clear that significant structural changes are required in such domains as global spending priorities, debt relief, trade policy, and corporate responsibility. HIV\/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are global problems borne of gross socioeconomic inequality, and their solutions require correspondingly geopolitical solutions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007be","authors":["Darrell HS Tan","Ross EG Upshur","Nathan Ford"],"doi":"10.1186\/1472-698x-3-2","first_seen_on":"2015-07-28T08:22:21+00:00","issns":["1472-698X"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC International Health and Human Rights","last_mentioned_on":1438094592,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-698X\/3\/2"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-698X-3-2.pdf","pmcid":"PMC155543","pmid":"12667262","pubdate":"2003-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health\/Gesundheitswesen","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Global plagues and the Global Fund: Challenges in the fight against HIV, TB and malaria","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/global-plagues-global-fund-challenges-fight-against-hiv-tb-malaria-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5422321,"mean":6.3134805950221,"rank":332075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":5087619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5422321,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189282,"mean":8.7062346247115,"rank":17787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":171429,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189282,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":221,"mean":4.3613272727273,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":221,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":5.4064,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
