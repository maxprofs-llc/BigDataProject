NaRs have a conserved Asn, Asp, and Gln motif (NDQ) in the third transmembrane helix (helix C). The NDQ motif is thus expected to play a crucial role in the operation of the Na(+) pump. Herein, we studied the photocycles of the NDQ-motif mutants of Krokinobacter rhodopsin 2 (KR2), the first discovered NaR, by flash photolysis, to obtain insight into the mechanism of Na(+) transport. For example, the KR2 N112A mutant did not accumulate the transient red-shifted Na(+) -bound state, suggesting that Asn112 is vital for the binding of Na(+) ions. Additionally, Q123A and Q123V mutants showed significantly slower Na(+) uptake and recovery of the initial state. Overall, the Gln123 residue was found to contribute to the optimization of the kinetics of sodium-ion uptake and release. These results demonstrate that the cooperative operation of the three residues of the NDQ motif are important in the operation of the Na(+) pump.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Inoue, Keiichi","Konno, Masae","Abe\u2010Yoshizumi, Rei","Kandori, Hideki"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201504549","endpage":"11539","first_seen_on":"2015-07-28T03:34:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-3773"],"issue":"39","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
