Neurological syndromes such as acute flaccid paralysis following EV-D68 infection have also been reported in a small number of cases.\nTo summarize the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of laboratory confirmed EV-D68 cases in Australia.\nWe combined EV-D68 data acquired through laboratory surveillance in Western Australia with cases from national enterovirus surveillance and regional acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance. Clinical data was obtained for EV-D68 cases and capsid protein sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis.\nSporadic cases of EV-D68 were recorded in Australia since 2008, with peaks in activity during 2011 and 2013. EV-D68 was primarily associated with respiratory disease, but was also detected in cerebrospinal fluid of one patient and faeces of two patients presenting with AFP.\nEV-D68 has been circulating in Western Australia and is likely to have also been present in the wider region for a number of years, causing primarily respiratory disease. Detection of EV-D68 in cerebrospinal fluid of one patient and in faeces of two AFP cases reinforces the association between EV-D68 and neurological disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d09","authors":["Levy, Avram","Roberts, Jason","Lang, Jurissa","Tempone, Simone","Kesson, Alison","Dofai, Alfred","Daley, Andrew J","Thorley, Bruce","Speers, David J","Avram Levy","Jason Roberts","Jurissa Lang","Simone Tempone","Alison Kesson","Alfred Dofai","Andrew J.
