A functional relationship between TSHR and IGF-1R has long been postulated and recently bi-directional cross-talk between the receptors in GO fibroblasts was demonstrated. Because the transcription factor Forkhead box O-1 (FoxO1) was recently shown to be a critical downstream mediator of TSH and IGF-1 effects on thyrocyte proliferation, we designed studies to determine whether FoxO1 might similarly act as a common mediator of M22, a stimulatory TSHR antibody (TSAb), and IGF-1 in GO orbital fibroblasts.\nFOXO1 mRNA and protein were measured in orbital tissue specimens derived from normal individuals and patients with GO. In addition, we investigated the control of FoxO1 cellular localization using quantitative Western blotting of fractionated cell lysates from orbital fibroblasts treated with M22 and\/or IGF-1 with or without specific TSHR, IGF-1R, or PI3K\/Akt1\/2 inhibitors.\nWe found significantly lower levels of both FOXO1 mRNA and protein in GO orbital tissue specimens compared with normal orbital tissues (mean 39%; p=0.043 and 46.4%; p=0.028, respectively). In addition, treatment of GO orbital cultures with M22, IGF-1 or M22 plus IGF-1 increased cytoplasmic Fox-O1 compared with control (1.63 fold, p=0.008; 1.68, p=0.001; 1.61, p=<0.001, respectively) and decreased nuclear Fox-O1 (mean 28%, p=0.002; 38%, p=<0.001; 35%, p=0.007, respectively). These effects were inhibited by co-treatment with the respective, but not the opposite, receptor antagonist. Akt inhibition of M22 or IGF-1 treated cultures was found to increase nuclear (1.4 fold; p=0.026 and (1.3 fold; p=0.001, respectively) and decrease cytoplasmic (24.2%; p=0.001 and 36%; p=0.004, respectively) Fox-O1 localization.\nThese data point to FoxO1 as an important mediator of TSAb and IGF-1 action via their cognate receptors in GO orbital fibroblasts. These findings provide a link between the low FoxO1 protein levels demonstrated in GO orbital tissue and the tissue remodeling characteristic of GO, and suggest novel therapy for GO aimed at increasing nuclear expression of FoxO1 in GO target cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003667","authors":["Kumar, Seema","Coenen, Michael J","Iyer, Seethalakshmi","Bahn, Rebecca S"],"doi":"10.1089\/thy.2015.0254","first_seen_on":"2015-07-28T17:30:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-9077"],"journal":"Thyroid","last_mentioned_on":1438104649,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26213859?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26213859","pubdate":"2015-07-28T22:00:24+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"The forkhead transcription factor Fox01 is regulated by both a stimulatory thyrotropin receptor antibody and insulin-like growth factor-1 in orbital fibroblasts from patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/forkhead-transcription-factor-foxo1-regulated-both-stimulatory-thyrotropin-receptor-antibody-insulin-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5422321,"mean":6.3134805950221,"rank":4511727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5422321,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189281,"mean":8.7063012256975,"rank":151993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189281,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":765,"mean":4.4573795811518,"rank":646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":765,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.7458333333333,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/eyecenterllc\/status\/626082394773291008","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4337862],"posted_on":"2015-07-28T17:30:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Eye Center","url":"http:\/\/eyecenterllc.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/355341300\/apple-touch-icon_normal.png","description":"Ophthalmologists - Eye Physicians and Surgeons.
