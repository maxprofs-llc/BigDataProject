Therefore, in this work, Ti-6Al-4V Gyroid and Diamond TPMS lattices having an interconnected high porosity of 80-95% and pore sizes in the range of 560-1600\u03bcm and 480-1450\u03bcm respectively were manufactured by selective laser melting (SLM) for bone implants. The manufacturability, microstructure and mechanical properties of the Ti-6Al-4V TPMS lattices were evaluated. Comparison between 3D micro-CT reconstructed models and original CAD models of the Ti-6Al-4V TPMS lattices shows excellent reproduction of the designs. The as-built Ti-6Al-4V struts exhibit the microstructure of columnar grains filled with very fine and orthogonally oriented \u03b1' martensitic laths with the width of 100-300nm and have the microhardness of 4.01\u00b10.34GPa. After heat treatment at 680\u00b0C for 4h, the \u03b1' martensite was converted to a mixture of \u03b1 and \u03b2, in which the \u03b1 phase being the dominant fraction is present as fine laths with the width of 500-800nm and separated by a small amount of narrow, interphase regions of dark \u03b2 phase. Also, the microhardness is decreased to 3.71\u00b10.35GPa due to the coarsening of the microstructure. The 80-95% porosity TPMS lattices exhibit a comparable porosity with trabecular bone, and the modulus is in the range of 0.12-1.25GPa and thus can be adjusted to the modulus of trabecular bone. At the same range of porosity of 5-10%, the moduli of cortical bone and of the Ti-6Al-4V TPMS lattices are in a similar range. Therefore, the modulus and porosity of Ti-6Al-4V TPMS lattices can be tailored to the levels of human bones and thus reduce or avoid \"stress shielding\" and increase longevity of implants. Due to the biomorphic designs, and high interconnected porosity and stiffness comparable to human bones, SLM-made Ti-6Al-4V TPMS lattices can be a promising material for load bearing bone implants.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007ed5","authors":["Yan, Chunze","Hao, Liang","Hussein, Ahmed","Young, Philippe","Chunze Yan","Liang Hao","Ahmed Hussein","Philippe Young"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jmbbm.2015.06.024","endpage":"73","first_seen_on":"2015-07-27T15:34:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"10871\/20304","handles":["10871\/20304"],"issns":["1878-0180","17516161"],"journal":"Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials","last_mentioned_on":1438011233,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26210549","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jmbbm.2015.06.024"],"pmid":"26210549","pubdate":"2015-07-27T22:00:13+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"61","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Ti-6Al-4V triply periodic minimal surface structures for bone implants fabricated via selective laser melting.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1751616115002295","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ti6al4v-triply-periodic-minimal-surface-structures-bone-implants-fabricated-via-selective-laser-melt"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5407305,"mean":6.305638961301,"rank":4498911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5407305,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189285,"mean":8.6951790748294,"rank":151923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189285,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231,"mean":2.5732434782609,"rank":166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.77916666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
