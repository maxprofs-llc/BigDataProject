Particularly, information is currently unavailable regarding the possible influence of alterations in myocardial function on [Formula: see text] and performance during exercise in the heat. This study investigated the effects of environmental heat on [Formula: see text], peak work capacity, and myocardial function during a standard, progressive cycle test to exhaustion. Twelve euhydrated men (aged 20.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7\u00a0years) performed a maximal cycle test in an environmental chamber in both heat stress [35\u00b0C, 30% relative humidity (RH)] and temperate (20\u00b0C, 30% RH) conditions with measurement of standard gas exchange variables, core temperature, and echocardiographic measures of cardiac function.\nA small but statistically significant reduction of peak work capacity was observed in the heat stress versus temperate conditions (253\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030 and 259\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030\u00a0W, respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Mean [Formula: see text] was not statistically different in the two conditions (p\u00a0=\u00a00.16) but values were 3.4% lower in the heat, and 9 of 12 participants demonstrated lower values in the heat stress trial. No differences in responses of heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, core temperature, hydration status, or myocardial systolic or diastolic function were observed between the two conditions, but perceived body temperature was higher in the heat.\nThe small, negative impact of heat on exercise performance and [Formula: see text] could not be explained by disturbances in myocardial functional responses to exercise in young adult males.","altmetric_jid":"508ef8343cf058ec30000000","authors":["Denise L Smith","Jacob P DeBlois","Margaret Wharton","Thomas Rowland"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13728-015-0031-z","first_seen_on":"2015-07-27T14:21:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2046-7648"],"journal":"Extreme Physiology & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1438075138,"links":["http:\/\/www.extremephysiolmed.com\/content\/4\/1\/11","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1186\/s13728-015-0031-z\/fulltext.html"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.extremephysiolmed.com\/content\/pdf\/s13728-015-0031-z.pdf","pmid":"26207175","pubdate":"2015-07-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Emergency Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Intensive \/ Critical Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pneumology\/Respiratory System","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sports Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Myocardial functional responses do not contribute to maximal exercise performance in the heat.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/myocardial-functional-responses-not-contribute-maximal-exercise-performance-heat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5422321,"mean":6.3134805950221,"rank":2502764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2783376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5422321,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189460,"mean":8.6973472466339,"rank":85692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":97262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189460,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":9.344756097561,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.87,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
