It aimed to evaluate the mid-term progress of implementation and related factors. Altogether, 80 therapists had been educated through the implementation program by the point of the mid-term evaluation. Eligible information for evaluation was gathered using two questionnaires (q1, q2) with a one-year interval. A total of 45 of the 80 therapists completed q1, 30 completed q2, and 24 completed both questionnaires. Professional education was the only background factor associated with adopting the interventions (q1: p=0.059, q2: p=0.023), with higher education indicating greater activity. On the basis of trends such as changes in overall usefulness score from q1 to q2, the most involved therapists were slightly more likely to adopt MI\/BA. Our experience so far suggests that encouraging staff to begin using new interventions during education is very important. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was found to be a useful tool for constructing the evaluation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5933cf058f610004f36","authors":["Lindholm, Lars H","Koivukangas, Antti","Lassila, Antero","Kampman, Olli"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.evalprogplan.2015.05.004","first_seen_on":"2015-07-28T17:20:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-7870"],"journal":"Evaluation & Program Planning","last_mentioned_on":1438104908,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26113263?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26113263","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Urban And Regional Planning","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Business, Management and Accounting","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"Early assessment of implementing evidence-based brief therapy interventions among secondary service psychiatric therapists.","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/early-assessment-implementing-evidencebased-brief-therapy-interventions-among-secondary-service-psyc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5422157,"mean":6.3120406882422,"rank":4511210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5422157,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189293,"mean":8.7063214821546,"rank":151995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189293,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179,"mean":2.5917752808989,"rank":160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":9.5625,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
