Folic acid supplementation can help negate these detrimental effects by reducing tHcy. Recent evidence has suggested an additional anti-atherogenic property of folate in protecting lipoproteins against oxidation. This study utilized both an in vitro and in vivo approach. In vitro: Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) were isolated by rapid ultracentrifugation and then oxidized in the presence of increasing concentrations (0-->10 micromol\/L) of either folic acid or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF). In vivo: Twelve female subjects were supplemented with folic acid (1 mg\/day), and the pre- and post-VLDL and LDL isolates subjected to oxidation. In vitro: 5-MTHF, but not folic acid, significantly increased the resistance of VLDL and LDL to oxidation. In vivo: Following folic acid supplementation, tHcy decreased, serum folate increased, and both VLDL and LDL displayed a significant increase in their resistance to oxidation. These results indicated that in vitro, only the active form of folate, 5-MTHF, had antioxidant properties. In vivo results demonstrated that folic acid supplementation reduced tHcy and protected both VLDL and LDL against oxidation. These findings provide further support for the use of folic acid supplements to aid in the prevention of atherosclerosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61c3cf058f6100077fd","authors":["McEneny, Jane","Couston, Claire","McKibben, Bronac","Young, Ian S","Woodside, Jayne V"],"doi":"10.1024\/0300-9831.77.1.66","first_seen_on":"2015-07-27T19:51:25+00:00","issns":["0300-9831"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal for Vitamin and Nutrition Research","last_mentioned_on":1438026658,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17685097"],"pmid":"17685097","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Folate: in vitro and in vivo effects on VLDL and LDL oxidation.","type":"article","volume":"77","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/folate-vitro-vivo-effects-vldl-ldl-oxidation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5407015,"mean":6.3053667724917,"rank":3804831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":908381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5407015,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189285,"mean":8.6947839014391,"rank":131129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":37360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189285,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185,"mean":4.36525,"rank":121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CamWellness\/status\/625755278135332865","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4333782],"posted_on":"2015-07-27T19:50:58+00:00","author":{"name":"Cam Wellness","url":"http:\/\/www.cam-wellness.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000573443573\/1c19e70e7f2731336a7538d8eca7ad9a_normal.jpeg","description":"For Betterment of Human Life.
