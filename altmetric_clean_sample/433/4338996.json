The primary endpoint assessed non-inferiority and superiority on QLS total score analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measurements.\nOf 295 randomized patients, 100\/148 (67.6%) of AOM 400 and 83\/147 (56.5%) of PP patients completed 28weeks of treatment. A statistically significant least squares mean difference in change from baseline to week 28 on QLS total score (4.67 [95%CI: 0.32;9.02], p=0.036) confirmed non-inferiority and established superiority of AOM 400 vs PP. There were also significant improvements in Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale and the Investigator's Assessment Questionnaire for AOM 400 vs PP, and pre-defined sub-group analyses revealed a consistent pattern of significance favoring AOM 400 in patients \u226435years. Common treatment-emergent adverse events in the treatment continuation phase were more frequent with PP vs AOM 400, and adverse events were the most frequent reason for discontinuation (27\/137 [19.7%] for PP and 16\/144 [11.1%] for AOM 400). All-cause discontinuation was numerically lower with AOM 400.\nSuperior improvements on clinician-rated health-related quality of life and a favorable tolerability profile suggest greater overall effectiveness for aripiprazole once-monthly vs paliperidone palmitate.
