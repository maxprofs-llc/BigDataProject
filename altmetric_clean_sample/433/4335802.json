After propensity score matching, the cost for obese patients was higher at $1,826 (P < .0001) for mastectomy and $1,702 for BC (P < .0001). These costs were not significantly associated with overall complications and length of stay for mastectomy in the matched comparison group and not associated with overall complications and minimally associated with longer length of stay in the BC group.\nBy controlling for other patient factors, this study shows that obesity is attributable to a significantly higher cost for both BC (29%) and mastectomy (23%).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221f","authors":["Sun, Susie X","Greenleaf, Erin K","Hollenbeak, Christopher S","Leung, Anna M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjsurg.2015.06.003","first_seen_on":"2015-07-28T10:01:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1883"],"journal":"American Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1438078448,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26212389?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26212389","pubdate":"2015-07-28T22:00:56+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Attributable cost of obesity in breast surgery: a\u00a0matched cohort analysis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/attributable-cost-obesity-breast-surgery-matched-cohort-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5423667,"mean":6.3132129404735,"rank":3816644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":911129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5423667,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189302,"mean":8.7051996872706,"rank":131175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":37287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189302,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1492,"mean":2.2293118712274,"rank":893,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1492,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":1.4777272727273,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
