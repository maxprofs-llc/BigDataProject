Reintroduction of blood flow results in the production of free radicals and reactive oxygen species that damage cells. Skeletal muscle IRI is commonly seen in orthopedic trauma patients. Experimental studies in other organ systems have elucidated the importance of extracellular and intracellular matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) isoforms in regulating tissue damage in the setting of oxidant stress resulting from IRI. While the extracellular full-length isoform of MMP-2 (FL-MMP-2) has been previously studied in the setting of skeletal muscle IRI, studies investigating the role of the N-terminal truncated isoform (NTT-MMP-2) in this setting are lacking. In this study, we first demonstrated significant increases in FL- and NTT-MMP-2 gene expression in C2C12 myoblast cells responding to re-oxygenation following hypoxia in vitro. We then evaluated the expression of FL- and NTT-MMP-2 in modulating skeletal muscle IRI using a previously validated murine model. NTT-MMP-2, but not FL-MMP-2 expression was significantly increased in skeletal muscle following IRI. Moreover, the expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) -2 and -4, IL-6, OAS-1A, and CXCL1 was also significantly up-regulated following IRI. Treatment with the potent anti-oxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) significantly suppressed NTT-MMP-2, but not FL-MMP-2 expression and improved muscle viability following IRI. This data suggests that NTT-MMP-2, but not FL-MMP-2, is the major isoform of MMP-2 involved in skeletal muscle IRI. This article is protected by copyright.
