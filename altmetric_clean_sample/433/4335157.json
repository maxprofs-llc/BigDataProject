Further, such miRNAs may be useful to address chemotherapeutic resistance in cancer, which remains a primary clinical challenge in need of solutions. Thus, cytoprotective processes upregulated in cancer cells that are resistant to chemotherapy are a logical target for investigation. Here we report that overexpression of miR-634 activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by direct concurrent targeting of genes associated with mitochondrial homeostasis, anti-apoptosis, antioxidant ability and autophagy. In particular, we show how enforced expression of miR-634 enhanced chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity in a model of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), where resistance to chemotherpy remains clinically problematic. Our findings illustrate how reversing miR-634-mediated cytoprotective processes may offer a broadly useful approach to improving cancer therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["Naoto Fujiwara","Jun Inoue","Tatsuyuki Kawano","Kousuke Tanimoto","Ken-ichi Kozaki","Johji Inazawa"],"doi":"10.1158\/0008-5472.can-15-0257","first_seen_on":"2015-07-28T03:38:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1538-7445"],"journal":"Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1452013504,"links":["http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/27\/0008-5472.CAN-15-0257.short?rss=1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26216549?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/27\/0008-5472.CAN-15-0257.abstract?sid=9f4b0057-b0b8-40d4-acc7-7ce200414ce3"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/27\/0008-5472.CAN-15-0257.full.pdf","pmid":"26216549","pubdate":"2015-07-29T10:06:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"MiR-634 activates the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and enhances chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir634-activates-mitochondrial-apoptosis-pathway-enhances-chemotherapyinduced-cytotoxicity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6908690,"mean":6.2029462469629,"rank":2966482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":3785888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6908690,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223368,"mean":8.1138844054853,"rank":95869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":119538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223368,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6612,"mean":6.6810727575253,"rank":3776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":2580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6612,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270,"mean":4.6994423791822,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
