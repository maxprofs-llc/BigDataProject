Data from both human and murine systems demonstrate that cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) can recognize peptides derived from TERT and kill TERT-positive tumor cells of multiple histologies. Given the vast overexpression of hTERT in human tumors and its low-level expression in rare normal tissues, clinical trials have begun that test the credentials of hTERT as a broadly applicable target for immunotherapy of cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003240","authors":["Vonderheide, Robert H"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.onc.1205074","first_seen_on":"2015-07-28T05:31:10+00:00","issns":["0950-9232"],"issue":"4","journal":"Oncogene","last_mentioned_on":1435469423,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11850795"],"pmid":"11850795","pubdate":"2002-01-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","neoplasms"],"title":"Telomerase as a universal tumor-associated antigen for cancer immunotherapy.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/telomerase-universal-tumorassociated-antigen-cancer-immunotherapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5285691,"mean":6.2167864343182,"rank":1326544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3346011,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5285691,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186802,"mean":8.7003043024396,"rank":58485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":126061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186802,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3494,"mean":3.6440526767821,"rank":567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3494,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":5.9213684210526,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
