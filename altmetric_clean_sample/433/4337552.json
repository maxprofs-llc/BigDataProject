Fixed effect and logistic models were done to predict International Society of Nephrology\/Renal Pathology Society (ISN\/RPS) class; low\/moderate vs. high LN-activity [NIH Activity Index (NIH-AI) score:\u2009\u2264\u200910 vs.\u2009>\u200910; Tubulointerstitial Activity Index (TIAI) score:\u2009\u2264\u20095 vs.\u2009>\u20095) or the absence vs. presence of LN chronicity [NIH Chronicity Index (NIH-CI) score: 0 vs.\u2009\u2265\u20091].\nThere were 10, 50 and 23 patients with class I\/II, III\/IV and V, respectively. Scores of the clinical indices did not differentiate among patients by ISN\/RPS class. The SLEDAI-R and SLICC-RAS but not the BILAG-R differed with LN-activity status defined by NIH-AI scores, while only the SLEDAI-R scores differed between LN-activity status based on TIAI scores. The sensitivity and specificity of the SDI-R to capture LN chronicity was 23.5% and 91.7%, respectively. Despite designed to measure LN-activity, SLICC-RAS and SLEDAI-R scores significantly differed with LN chronicity status.\nCurrent clinical indices of LN fail to discriminate ISN\/RPS Class in children. Despite its shortcomings, the SLEDAI-R appears to best for measuring LN activity in a clinical setting. The SDI-R is a poor correlate of LN chronicity. This article is protected by copyright.
