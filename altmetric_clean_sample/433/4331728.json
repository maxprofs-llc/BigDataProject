Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) ameliorates libido, improves bone mass, improves insulin resistance, reduces fat mass and increases lean body mass with no change in body weight. There are no evidences that testosterone therapy increases the risk of prostate cancer but it is certain that testosterone stimulates growth of metastatic prostate cancer. TRT has an antiarrhythmic and a vasodilator effect, independent of the nitric oxide effect. Patients with heart failure have low levels of testosterone, and TRT improves exercise capacity. Men with low testosterone have risk for premature death. Cardiovascular adverse effects of testosterone therapy are under discussion. We need large prospective placebo-controlled randomized trials to determine definitively the cardiovascular risks of TRT.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9173cf058f61000d0d1","authors":["Ungureanu, Maria-Christina","Costache, Irina-Iuliana","Preda, Cristina","Mogo\u015f, Voichi\u0163a","Vulpoi, Carmen","Leu\u015ftean, Leti\u0163ia"],"first_seen_on":"2015-07-27T07:18:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0048-7848"],"issue":"2","journal":"Revista medico chirurgical\u0103\u0306 a Societ\u0103\u0306\u0163\u031cii de Medici \u015f\u0327i Naturali\u015f\u0327ti din Ia\u015f\u0327i","last_mentioned_on":1437981458,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26204632"],"pmid":"26204632","pubdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["medicine","generalsurgery"],"title":"MYTHS AND CONTROVERSIES IN HYPOGONADISM TREATMENT OF AGING MALES.","type":"article","volume":"119","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/myths-controversies-hypogonadism-treatment-aging-males"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5407305,"mean":6.305638961301,"rank":3805014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":908421,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5407305,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189286,"mean":8.6951344586206,"rank":131130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":37363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189286,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":1.454525,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
