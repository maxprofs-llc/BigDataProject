Nonetheless, recent studies in academia and industry have identified novel surface pockets accepting small-molecule ligands in both their active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound forms (Ras\u2022GTP and Ras\u2022GDP, respectively), which has led to a surge of investigations into the discovery of Ras-specific inhibitors particularly by utilizing their structural information for structure-based drug design (SBDD). We have been developing Ras inhibitors by SBDD targeting a novel conformation of Ras\u2022GTP called state 1, possessing \"druggable\" surface pockets, which emerges from the conformational dynamics. In this review article, we will survey Ras functions from the structural biological point of view and summarize the current status of the development of Ras inhibitors including our own.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f81","authors":["Fumi Shima","Shigeyuki Matsumoto","Yoko Yoshikawa","Takashi Kawamura","Masayuki Isa","Tohru Kataoka"],"doi":"10.1093\/jb\/mvv060","first_seen_on":"2015-07-28T16:48:22+00:00","issns":["1756-2651"],"journal":"Journal of Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1438102065,"links":["http:\/\/jb.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/158\/2\/91.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jb.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/158\/2\/91.full.pdf","pmid":"26100833","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Current status of the development of Ras inhibitors","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/current-status-development-ras-inhibitors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8006000,"mean":6.7576915960097,"rank":6070535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1078592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8006000,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228863,"mean":8.3314609939615,"rank":158218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":38270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228863,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":757,"mean":2.6346878306878,"rank":633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":757,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.1227272727273,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
