Primary corneoscleral cysts may arise from proliferation of anomalously situated epithelial or endothelial cells. We report the case of a 2-year-old girl with a primary enlarging cyst situated at the limbus of her left eye. Optical coherence tomography was used to determine whether there was any communication between the cyst and the anterior chamber and to help plan appropriate management.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b5b","authors":["AlQahtani, Elham","Godoy, Flavia","Lyons, Christopher"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jaapos.2015.03.020","first_seen_on":"2015-07-28T17:31:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1091-8531","1528-3933"],"journal":"Journal of AAPOS (Journal of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus)","last_mentioned_on":1438104646,"links":["http:\/\/www.jaapos.org\/article\/S1091-8531(15)00173-1\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jaapos.org\/article\/S1091853115001731\/pdf","pmid":"26228966","pubdate":"2015-08-01T22:00:43+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics","ophthalmology"],"title":"Enlarging corneoscleral cyst in\u00a0a\u00a02-year-old girl","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enlarging-corneoscleral-cyst-2yearold-girl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5422321,"mean":6.3134805950221,"rank":4511727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5422321,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189281,"mean":8.7063012256975,"rank":151993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189281,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":326,"mean":2.9116738461538,"rank":232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":326,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.82083333333333,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/eyecenterllc\/status\/626082380374245377","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4337864],"posted_on":"2015-07-28T17:30:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Eye Center","url":"http:\/\/eyecenterllc.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/355341300\/apple-touch-icon_normal.png","description":"Ophthalmologists - Eye Physicians and Surgeons.
