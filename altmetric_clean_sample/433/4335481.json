Despite advances in medical care, the prevalence of both community-acquired and hospital-acquired MRSA has progressively increased. Community-acquired MRSA typically occurs in patients without recent illness or hospitalization, presents as acute skin and soft tissue infections, and is usually not multidrug resistant. Hospital-acquired MRSA, however, presents in patients recently hospitalized or treated in long-term care settings and in those who have had medical procedures and is usually associated with multidrug-resistant strains. Both types of infections, if not properly treated, have the potential to become invasive. This article discusses current intravenous antibiotics that are available for the empiric treatment of MRSA infections along with a newer phenomenon known as the \"seesaw effect.\"","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005d57","authors":["Scordo, Kristine
