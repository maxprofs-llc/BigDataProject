The dendritic cell-associated C-type lectin receptor (Dectin-1), toll\u2011like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-4 are major pattern recognition receptors in alveolar macrophages that recognize A.\u00a0fumigatus components. The PU.1 transcription factor is known to be important for the transcriptional control of these three receptors in mature macrophages. The present study investigated whether alterations of PU.1 expression may affect the innate defense against A.\u00a0fumigatus in the human monocyte THP\u20111 cell line. THP-1-derived macrophages were transduced with PU.1 adenoviral vectors and transfected with PU.1 small interfering RNA, and the mRNA and protein expression levels of Dectin\u20111, TLR\u20112 and TLR\u20114 were measured. In addition, the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2011\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)\u20111\u03b2 were ascertained, and fungal phagocytosis and killing were assessed. The results demonstrated that overexpression of PU.1 by recombinant adenoviral vectors resulted in a significant upregulation of Dectin\u20111, TLR\u20112 and TLR\u20114 at the transcriptional and translational levels. In response to A.\u00a0fumigatus stimulation, PU.1 overexpression increased TNF\u2011\u03b1 and IL\u20111\u03b2 production. In addition, Dectin\u20111, TLR\u20112 and TLR\u20114 upregulation may have enhanced the phagocytosis and killing ability of THP\u20111\u2011derived macrophages. As expected, silencing of PU.1 led to downregulation of Dectin\u20111, TLR\u20112, TLR\u20114 and the expression of pro\u2011inflammatory cytokines, as well as decreased phagocytosis and the killing ability of THP1\u2011derived macrophages. In conclusion, the results indicate that PU.1 may be a critical factor for the innate defense against A.\u00a0fumigatus, and may therefore be a potential target for the prophylaxis and treatment of IPA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Liu, Chenyang ","Wang, Min ","Sun, Wenkui ","Cai, Feng ","Geng, Shen ","Su, Xin ","Shi, Yi "],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2017.6504","first_seen_on":"2017-04-26T23:58:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-2997","1791-3004"],"journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1493253828,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28440496?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28440496","pubdate":"2017-04-27T22:14:03+00:00","publisher":"Spandidos Publications","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"PU.1 serves a critical role in the innate defense against Aspergillus\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdfumigatus via dendritic cell-associated C-type lectin receptor-1 and toll-like receptors-2 and 4 in THP-1-derived macrophages","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pu1-serves-critical-role-innate-defense-against-aspergillus-fumigatus-via-dendritic-cellassociated-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8133607,"mean":6.8853774979927,"rank":4079979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3846961,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8133607,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234116,"mean":12.667528214766,"rank":118629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":105404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234116,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2067,"mean":1.6143426911907,"rank":269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2067,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":0.67978723404255,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
