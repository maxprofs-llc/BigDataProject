We intended to evaluate the expression of KIR3DL2 on blood T-cells as a diagnostic, prognostic and follow-up marker of SS.\n64 patients diagnosed with SS were included in this monocentric study. We collected the percentage of KIR3DL2+ cells among CD3+ T-cells, obtained by flow cytometry, and other classical diagnostic criteria for SS at diagnosis and during the follow-up.\nCompared to the classical diagnostic factors, KIR3DL2 was the most sensitive diagnostic factor for SS. Univariate and multivariate analyses established that an eosinophil cell count >700\/mm3 and a percentage of KIR3DL2+ cells within the CD3+ T-cells >85% at diagnosis were associated with a significantly reduced disease-specific survival. Moreover, KIR3DL2 immuno-staining allowed the assessment of treatment efficiency and specificity towards tumour cells, the detection of the residual disease following treatment, and the occurrence of relapse, even though patients clinically experienced complete remission and\/or undetectable circulating S\u00e9zary cells by cytomorphologic analysis.\nWe show that KIR3DL2 expression is the most sensitive diagnostic criterion of SS when compared with all other available biological criteria. It also represents the best independent prognostic factor for SS-specific death and the most relevant feature for the follow-up of SS, showing the invasion of the functional lymphocytes pool by S\u00e9zary cells. KIR3DL2 therefore represents a valuable tool for routine use as a clinical parameter at diagnosis, for prognosis and during patient follow-up.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efa","authors":["Charlotte Hurabielle","Nicolas Thonnart","Caroline Ram-Wolff","H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Sicard","Armand Bensussan","Martine Bagot","Anne Marie-Cardine"],"doi":"10.1158\/1078-0432.ccr-16-3185","first_seen_on":"2017-04-27T00:12:23+00:00","issns":["1078-0432","1557-3265"],"journal":"Clinical Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1500008692,"links":["http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2017\/04\/25\/1078-0432.CCR-16-3185?papetoc=","http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/23\/14\/3619?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/clincanres\/early\/2017\/04\/25\/1078-0432.CCR-16-3185.full.pdf","pmid":"28119365","pubdate":"2017-01-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for Cancer Research","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Usefulness of KIR3DL2 to Diagnose, Follow-Up and Manage the Treatment of S\u00e9zary Syndrome Patients","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/usefulness-kir3dl2-diagnose-followup-manage-treatment-patients-s%C3%A9zary-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8208063,"mean":6.9506291146371,"rank":4124191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3874694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8208063,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238152,"mean":12.728058030409,"rank":121184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":106802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238152,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5397,"mean":6.1867512972572,"rank":3338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1739,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5397,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":11.685107142857,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerCureNow\/statuses\/857386851858042880","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19617585],"posted_on":"2017-04-27T00:12:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Cure Cancer Now","url":"http:\/\/cancercure-d.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1128872809\/Hep_G2_Lab_test_normal.jpg","description":"Pure science is what it is taking to defeat cancer.
