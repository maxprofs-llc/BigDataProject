We hypothesize that athletic patients will be constrained regarding their sporting activities after surgically treated humeral head fractures. Despite a long rehabilitation program physical activities will change and an avoidance of overhead activities will be noticed.\nCase series with 65 Patients, with a minimum follow-up of 24\u00a0months participated in this study. All patients were treated using a locking plate fixation. Their sporting activity was investigated at the time of the injury and re-investigated after an average of 3.83\u00a0years. The questionnaire setup included the evaluation of shoulder function, sporting activities, intensity, sport level and frequency evaluation. Level of evidence IV.\nAt the time of injury 61 Patients (94%) were engaged in recreational sporting activities. The number of sporting activities declined from 26 to 23 at the follow-up examination. There was also a decline in sports frequency and duration of sports activities.\nThe majority of patients remains active in their recreational sporting activity at a comparable duration and frequency both pre- and postoperatively. Nevertheless, shoulder centered sport activities including golf, water skiing and martial arts declined or were given up.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ca","authors":["Philipp Ahrens","Frank Martetschl\u00e4ger","Sebastian Siebenlist","Johann Attenberger","Moritz Cr\u00f6nlein","Peter Biberthaler","Ulrich St\u00f6ckle","Gunther H.
