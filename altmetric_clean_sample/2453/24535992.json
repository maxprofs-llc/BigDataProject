From the perspective of cognitive load theory (CLT), cueing has a positive effect on learning outcomes because of the reduction in total cognitive load and avoidance of cognitive overload. However, this has not been systematically evaluated. Moreover, what remains ambiguous is the direct relationship between the cue-related cognitive load and learning outcomes. A meta-analysis and two subsequent meta-regression analyses were conducted to explore these issues. Subjective total cognitive load (SCL) and scores on a retention test and transfer test were selected as dependent variables. Through a systematic literature search, 32 eligible articles encompassing 3,597 participants were included in the SCL-related meta-analysis. Among them, 25 articles containing 2,910 participants were included in the retention-related meta-analysis and the following retention-related meta-regression, while there were 29 articles containing 3,204 participants included in the transfer-related meta-analysis and the transfer-related meta-regression. The meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant cueing effect on subjective ratings of cognitive load (d = -0.11, 95% CI = [-0.19, -0.02], p < 0.05), retention performance (d = 0.27, 95% CI = [0.08, 0.46], p < 0.01), and transfer performance (d = 0.34, 95% CI = [0.12, 0.56], p < 0.01). The subsequent meta-regression analyses showed that dSCL for cueing significantly predicted dretention for cueing (\u03b2 = -0.70, 95% CI = [-1.02, -0.38], p < 0.001), as well as dtransfer for cueing (\u03b2 = -0.60, 95% CI = [-0.92, -0.28], p < 0.001). Thus in line with CLT, adding cues in multimedia materials can indeed reduce SCL and promote learning outcomes, and the more SCL is reduced by cues, the better retention and transfer of multimedia learning.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Heping Xie","Fuxing Wang","Yanbin Hao","Jiaxue Chen","Jing An","Yuxin Wang","Huashan Liu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0183884","first_seen_on":"2017-08-30T17:40:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1504185392,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0183884","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0183884"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0183884&type=printable","pmid":"28854205","pubdate":"2017-08-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0183884","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"The more total cognitive load is reduced by cues, the better retention and transfer of multimedia learning: A meta-analysis and two meta-regression analyses","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/more-total-cognitive-load-reduced-cues-better-retention-transfer-multimedia-learning-metaanalysis-tw"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":6414608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1149432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175576,"mean":12.517832595757,"rank":124352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":32008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175576,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116447,"mean":10.678997423699,"rank":85074,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":18320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116447,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2400,"mean":12.674996248437,"rank":1645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2400,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aprendedorweb\/statuses\/902949021970509827","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24535992],"posted_on":"2017-08-30T17:39:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Alex","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/877344770355494917\/nOWNu028_normal.jpg","description":"Aprende de todo, Aprende de todos.","id_on_source":"aprendedorweb","tweeter_id":"2806836826","geo":{"lt":32.65002,"ln":-115.46107,"country":"MX"},"followers":1277},"tweet_id":"902949021970509827"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/uranus_2\/statuses\/903245117376442368","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24535992],"posted_on":"2017-08-31T13:16:32+00:00","author":{"name":"\u30de\u30fc\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30fc\uff12\u4e16","url":"http:\/\/smetc.blog120.fc2.com\/?sp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/650483455248064512\/EOJq3sZX_normal.png","description":"\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u3068\u3082\u5927\u5b66\u521d\u5e74\u6b21\u307e\u3067\u306f\u5834\u9762\u7dd8\u9ed9\u75c7\uff08\u81ea\u5df1\u8a3a\u65ad\uff09\u3060\u3063\u305f\u7537\u3002Twitter\u307e\u3068\u3081(http:\/\/psychobrain.seesaa.net\/)\u3002 \u6ce8\u610f\u4e8b\u9805\u2460\u8ad6\u6587\u306f\u8981\u7d04\u3057\u304b\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u3044\u306a\u3044\u5834\u5408\u304c\u591a\u3044\u2461\u9593\u9055\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3042\u308a\u2462\u79c1\u306f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002","id_on_source":"uranus_2","tweeter_id":"253847599","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3450},"tweet_id":"903245117376442368"}]}}
