Studies have suggested that miR-330-5p is involved in the progression of several cancers. However, the role of miR-330-5p in NSCLC remains unclear. We investigated the effect on and mechanism of miR-330-5p in the progression of NSCLC. We found that miR-330-5p was significantly downregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines as detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), colony formation and cell cycle assays showed that overexpression of miR-330-5p markedly inhibited cell growth. Annexin\u00a0V-FITC\/PI and caspase-3 activity assays showed that overexpression of miR-330-5p significantly promoted cell apoptosis of NSCLC cells. Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed NIN\/RPN12 binding protein\u00a01 (NOB1) as a target gene of miR-330-5p. RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis showed that overexpression of miR-330-5p inhibited the expression of NOB1 as well as cyclin\u00a0D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase\u00a04 in NSCLC cells. Moreover, overexpression of NOB1 markedly reversed the miR\u2011330-5p-mediated inhibitory effect on NSCLC cell growth. Correlation analysis showed that miR\u2011330-5p expression was inversely correlated with NOB1 mRNA expression in NSCLC tissues. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-330-5p inhibits NSCLC cell growth through downregulation of NOB1 expression. Our study suggests that miR-330-5p may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NSCLC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000837e","authors":["Ranran Kong","Wei Liu","Yurui Guo","Jie Feng","Chuantao Cheng","Xinwu Zhang","Yuefeng Ma","Shaomin Li","Jiantao Jiang","Jin Zhang","Zhe Qiao","Jie Qin","Teng Lu","Xijing He"],"doi":"10.3892\/or.2017.5927","first_seen_on":"2017-08-30T15:25:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1021-335X","1791-2431"],"journal":"Oncology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1504106698,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28849232?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28849232","pubdate":"2017-08-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Inhibition of NOB1 by microRNA-330-5p overexpression represses cell growth of non-small cell lung cancer","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":7302267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173985,"mean":12.525693960364,"rank":142222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173985,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1641,"mean":1.6488292682927,"rank":963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1641,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":0.4051724137931,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/902915053573218304","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24531918],"posted_on":"2017-08-30T15:24:58+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
