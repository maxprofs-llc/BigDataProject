J Vet Med Sci. 2017\u2026"],"citation":{"abstract":"A 10-month-old male Welsh Corgi with a history of acute blindness underwent neuro-ophthalmological testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Vision testing revealed complete visual deficits but the electroretinograph and pupillary light reflex were normal in both eyes. The motor and sensory functions of the eyelids and eyes were also normal. The MRI revealed compression of the optic chiasm caused by severe ventriculomegaly in the lateral and third ventricles. Such lesions are associated with inflammatory stenotic lesions in the mesencephalic aqueduct. Moderate neutrophilic pleocytosis was observed during cerebrospinal fluid analysis and Acinetobacter lwoffii was isolated, leading to a diagnosis of Acinetobacter-positive obstructive hydrocephalus. This is the first reported case of culture-proven Acinetobacter-associated postencephalitic hydrocephalus with acute blindness in a dog.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f1f","authors":["Jung-Hyun KIM","Ji-Hee JEON","Kang-Hyo PARK","Hun-Young YOON","Joon-Young KIM"],"doi":"10.1292\/jvms.17-0075","first_seen_on":"2017-08-30T16:26:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0916-7250","1347-7439"],"journal":"Journal of Veterinary Medical Science","last_mentioned_on":1504262703,"links":["https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/jvms\/advpub\/0\/advpub_17-0075\/_article","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28855429?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/jvms\/advpub\/0\/advpub_17-0075\/_pdf","pmid":"28855429","pubdate":"2017-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"JAPANESE SOCIETY OF VETERINARY SCIENCE","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Acute blindness in a dog with<i> Acinetobacter<\/i>-associated postencephalitic hydrocephalus","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.75,"3m":1.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":3898920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4473198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176603,"mean":12.525219476563,"rank":75533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":98095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176603,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1605,"mean":1.0885386533666,"rank":217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":1368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1605,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":3.99375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Albinovet\/statuses\/902930590797889536","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24533918],"posted_on":"2017-08-30T16:26:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefano Cattaneo DVM","url":"http:\/\/veterinarialbino.com\/\/twitter_en.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1673372763\/vet_tweet_normal.png","description":"Daily updates about pet health covering the last articles published in veterinary journals.","id_on_source":"Albinovet","tweeter_id":"418669767","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2115},"tweet_id":"902930590797889536"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/narumita\/statuses\/903289537664770048","license":"gnip","rt":["Albinovet"],"citation_ids":[24533918],"posted_on":"2017-08-31T16:13:02+00:00","author":{"name":"\u5800\u3000\u6210\u7f8e","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/729128494349746180\/r60zQ5W7_normal.jpg","description":"Narumi Hori, RN, MPH, M.Ed  (Prevention, Care for Infectious Diseases, FETP-2007-2009) \u4ed5\u4e8b\u306f\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u306e\u4e88\u9632\u3068\u30b1\u30a2\u3002\u5f31\u70b9\uff1a\u9ad8\u6240\u6050\u6016\u75c7\u3067\u65b9\u5411\u97f3\u75f4\u3002\u7279\u6280\uff1a\u3069\u3053\u3067\u3082\u3059\u3050\u7761\u7720\u53ef\u80fd\u3002TW\u306f\u500b\u4eba\u306e\u3082\u306e\u3002RT\u2192\u5168\u3066\u8cdb\u540c\u3067\u3082\u306a\u3044\u3002","id_on_source":"narumita","tweeter_id":"128217144","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":19847},"tweet_id":"903289537664770048"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mayayatomomo\/statuses\/903297410763329536","license":"gnip","rt":["Albinovet"],"citation_ids":[24533918],"posted_on":"2017-08-31T16:44:19+00:00","author":{"name":"\ud83c\udf0a \u307e\u30fc\u3084 \ud83d\udc33\u305d\u308c\u306f\u79c1","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/903483304925569025\/n_gFEP5g_normal.jpg","description":"\u3044\u308d\u3044\u308d\u306a\u65b9\u306b\u898b\u3064\u3051\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059","id_on_source":"mayayatomomo","tweeter_id":"140010442","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2493},"tweet_id":"903297410763329536"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jvms_japan\/statuses\/903569384731316225","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24533918],"posted_on":"2017-09-01T10:45:03+00:00","author":{"name":"jvms_japan","url":"http:\/\/jsvetsci.jp\/jvms\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1898235853\/twitter-icon_normal.gif","id_on_source":"jvms_japan","tweeter_id":"524151017","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":36},"tweet_id":"903569384731316225"}]}}
