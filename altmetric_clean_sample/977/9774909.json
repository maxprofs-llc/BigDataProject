The treatment phase compared psyllium (5.1 g b.d.) plus docusate placebo to docusate sodium (100 mg b.d.) plus psyllium placebo. Stools were collected and assessed.\nCompared to baseline, psyllium increased stool water content vs. docusate (psyllium 2.33% vs. docusate 0.01%, P = 0.007). Psyllium also increased stool water weight (psyllium 84.0 g\/BM; docusate 71.4 g\/BM; P = 0.04), total stool output (psyllium 359.9 g\/week: docusate 271.9 g\/week; P = 0.005), and O'Brien rank-type score combining objective measures of constipation (psyllium 475.1; docusate 403.9; P = 0.002). Bowel movement (BM) frequency was significantly greater for psyllium (3.5 BM\/week) vs. docusate (2.9 BM\/week) in treatment week 2 (P = 0.02), with no significant difference (P > 0.05) between treatment groups in treatment week 1 (3.3 vs. 3.1 BM\/week).\nPsyllium is superior to docusate sodium for softening stools by increasing stool water content, and has greater overall laxative efficacy in subjects with chronic idiopathic constipation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021d1","authors":["McRorie, J W","Daggy, B P","Morel, J G","Diersing, P S","Miner, P B","Robinson, M"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-16T20:16:21+00:00","issns":["0269-2813"],"issue":"5","journal":"Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1501570800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9663731","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9663731"],"pmid":"9663731","pubdate":"1998-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pharmacology","gastroenterology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Psyllium is superior to docusate sodium for treatment of chronic constipation.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/psyllium-superior-docusate-sodium-treatment-chronic-constipation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16,"score_history":{"1y":16,"6m":16,"3m":7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307635,"mean":7.0030489970953,"rank":536743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7766218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307635,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261423,"mean":11.821995555079,"rank":26099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":235222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261423,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2524,"mean":7.5802615933413,"rank":174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":2347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2524,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":14.504307692308,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Other":4,"Student  > Master":11,"Student  > Bachelor":15,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":17,"Chemistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":9,"Nursing and Health Professions":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":5,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1,"MY":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"13 Home Remedies to Relieve Constipation Naturally","url":"https:\/\/authoritynutrition.com\/13-constipation-home-remedies\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[7505506,4985377,2415224,4153941,9774890,9774897,4869392,2213935,9774900,385543,1173465,2174269,1279955,9774903,781818,1311880,4675940,545611,1994629,7353419,1288846,207559,3189260,1336727,3888017,9774906,7107017,9774909,3189274,2565427,544633,9774915,422204,9774920,1525503,654521,318301,3393002,1343392,493078,9774922,9774925,9774931,4439580,2305122,9774938,3099181,2576580,2350757,9760514,9774940,8585432,9150273,3731852,1788160,3941148,4665154,414561,2756682,414562,3223650,9774947,1409538,1441385,4438795,4397700,9774950,9774952,9774955,2399097,1815182,240859,2592526,112164,106533,1127221,2059638,1264353],"posted_on":"2016-07-16T14:32:00+00:00","summary":"Constipation is an incredibly common problem.
