Its nanoencapsulation might favor the oil stability and its incorporation into hydrophilic formulations, besides increasing the contact with the skin and prolonging its effect. The aim of the present investigation was to develop suitable rose-hip-oil-loaded nanocapsules, to verify the nanocapsule effect on the UV-induced oxidation of the oil and to obtain topical formulations by the incorporation of the nanocapsules into chitosan gel and film. The rose-hip oil (500 or 600\u00a0\u03bcL), polymer (Eudragit RS100\u00ae, 100 or 200\u00a0mg), and acetone (50 or 100\u00a0mL) contents were separately varied aiming to obtain an adequate size distribution. The results led to a combination of the factors acetone and oil. The developed formulation showed average diameter of 158\u2009\u00b1\u20096\u00a0nm with low polydispersity, pH of 5.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9, zeta potential of +9.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\u00a0mV, rose-hip oil content of 54\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00a0\u03bcL\/mL and tendency to reversible creaming. No differences were observed in the nanocapsules properties after storage. The nanoencapsulation of rose-hip oil decreased the UVA and UVC oxidation of the oil. The chitosan gel and film containing rose-hip-oil-loaded nanocapsules showed suitable properties for cutaneous use. In conclusion, it was possible to successfully obtain rose-hip-oil-loaded nanocapsules and to confirm the nanocapsules effect in protecting the oil from the UV rays. The chitosan gel and film were considered interesting alternatives for incorporating the nanoencapsulated rose-hip oil, combining the advantages of the nanoparticles to the advantages of chitosan.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067ed","authors":["Contri, Renata V","Kulkamp-Guerreiro, Irene C","da Silva, Sheila Janine","Frank, Luiza A","Pohlmann, Adriana R","Guterres, Silvia S"],"doi":"10.1208\/s12249-015-0379-9","first_seen_on":"2015-09-20T09:46:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1530-9932"],"journal":"AAPS PharmSciTech","last_mentioned_on":1442448000,"links":["http:\/\/pharmagateway.net\/ArticlePage.aspx?DOI=10.1208\/s12249-015-0379-9"],"pmid":"26381915","pubdate":"2015-09-20T22:01:50+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Nanoencapsulation of Rose-Hip Oil Prevents Oil Oxidation and Allows Obtainment of Gel and Film Topical Formulations.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nanoencapsulation-rosehip-oil-prevents-oil-oxidation-allows-obtainment-gel-film-topical-formulations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6354289,"mean":5.8389329725063,"rank":823583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":5480969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6354289,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198712,"mean":9.8745513534731,"rank":38373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":158846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198712,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287,"mean":2.7676713286713,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":2.6314814814815,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
