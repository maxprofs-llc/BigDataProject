These long-term plasticity-related processes are the leading candidate models to study the basis of memory formation and persistence at the cellular level. Both STC and cross-tagging involve two serial processes: (1) setting of the synaptic tag as triggered by a specific pattern of stimulation, and (2) synaptic capture, whereby the synaptic tag interacts with newly synthesized plasticity-related proteins (PRPs). Much of the understanding about the concepts of STC and cross-tagging arises from the studies done in CA1 region of the hippocampus and because of the technical complexity many of the laboratories are still unable to study these processes. Experimental conditions for the preparation of hippocampal slices and the recording of stable late-LTP\/LTD are extremely important to study synaptic tagging\/cross-tagging. This video article describes the experimental procedures to study long-term plasticity processes such as STC and cross-tagging in the CA1 pyramidal neurons using stable, long-term field-potential recordings from acute hippocampal slices of rats.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f23","authors":["Shetty, Mahesh Shivarama","Sharma, Mahima","Hui, Neo Sin","Dasgupta, Ananya","Gopinadhan, Suma","Sajikumar, Sreedharan"],"doi":"10.3791\/53008","first_seen_on":"2015-09-19T10:55:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-087X"],"issue":"103","journal":"Journal of Visualized Experiments","last_mentioned_on":1442660137,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26381286?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26381286","pubdate":"2015-09-19T22:01:12+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","biology"],"title":"Investigation of Synaptic Tagging\/Capture and Cross-capture using Acute Hippocampal Slices from Rodents.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/investigation-synaptic-taggingcapture-crosscapture-using-acute-hippocampal-slices-rodents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6368969,"mean":5.8427884125037,"rank":3002693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1908737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6368969,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199280,"mean":9.8310831648092,"rank":107526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":71678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199280,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3589,"mean":2.9552575250836,"rank":1788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3589,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":1.9111363636364,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Neuroscience":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SynapsePapers\/statuses\/645189496124739584","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4531542],"posted_on":"2015-09-19T10:55:37+00:00","author":{"name":"SynapsePapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/566055028952018944\/nOqlF7Cg_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot bringing you new papers on neuronal synapses.
