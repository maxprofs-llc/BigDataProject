Critical deficiencies in clotting factors have been noted in trauma-induced coagulopathy. However, the exact underlying conditions that result in devastating coagulopathies remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to elucidate these underlying deficiencies.\nBlood samples were drawn from 45 severely injured trauma patients on their arrival at the resuscitation room, and the activities of all soluble clotting factors and routine coagulation tests were assessed. The Mann-Whitney-U-test was used to assess differences in coagulation activity between the patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, Spearman's rank correlation was used to analyze the blood work.\nAfter severe trauma the levels of serum fibrinogen and calcium were significantly reduced. Furthermore, traumatized patients had a significantly increased International Normalized Ratio (INR) compared to healthy controls. The median activities of all clotting factors were reduced after severe multiple trauma, with the exception of factor VIII, which was increased. Statistically significant differences were observed for factors II (80 vs. 122\u00a0%, P\u2009<\u20090.0001), V (76 vs. 123\u00a0%, P\u2009<\u20090.0001), VII (90 vs. 114\u00a0%, P\u2009=\u20090.002), VIII (200 vs. 108\u00a0%, P\u2009<\u20090.0001), and X (86 vs. 122\u00a0%, P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Spearman's correlation indicated a significant negative correlation between INR on arrival with fibrinogen and levels of factors II, V, and VII, whereas Partial Thromboplastin Time was significantly negatively correlated with factor VIII (all P\u2009<\u20090.0001).\nThese findings suggest a general but rather moderate impairment of clotting factor activities following severe multiple trauma. In the concept of a calculated coagulation therapy, this could demand for the use of factor concentrates with higher ratios of clotting factors. Finally, the physiological importance of strongly elevated factor VIII activity remains unclear, but a possible interference with ex vivo measurements of Partial Thromboplastin Time has to be considered.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b7","authors":["Manuel Burggraf","Arzu Payas","Max D Kauther","Carsten Schoeneberg","Sven Lendemans"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13017-015-0038-1","first_seen_on":"2015-09-22T02:45:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1749-7922"],"issue":"1","journal":"World Journal of Emergency Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1442889946,"links":["http:\/\/www.wjes.org\/content\/10\/1\/43?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.wjes.org\/content\/pdf\/s13017-015-0038-1.pdf","pmid":"26396589","pubdate":"2015-09-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Emergency Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Traumatic Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"43","title":"Evaluation of clotting factor activities early after severe multiple trauma and their correlation with coagulation tests and clinical data","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-clotting-factor-activities-early-after-severe-multiple-trauma-correlation-coagulation-tes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6386702,"mean":5.8553449560254,"rank":2813093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3401549,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6386702,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200600,"mean":9.8822930622783,"rank":98150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":93765,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200600,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":214,"mean":2.3580187793427,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":214,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.0646153846154,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
