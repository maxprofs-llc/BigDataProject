The association of DNA methylation patterns based on clinically relevant subgroups with lung cancer is still unexplored and not clear. For this purpose, we performed a targeted DNA methylation analysis of whole genome using 450\u00a0K Illumina BeadArrays on 146 tumor cells and 15 normal lung tissues. A total of 92 adenocarcinomas, 2 adenosquamous cancer, 30 squamous-cell carcinomas, 7 large-cell carcinomas, 4 small-cell lung carcinomas, and 11 large-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas have contributed to the 146 lung cancer tissues. In order to identify DNA methylation subgroups, unsupervised bootstrap clustering was performed. Subgroups were validated in 135 squamous-cell carcinomas and 712 adenocarcinomas followed by their characterization through gene expression profiles, clinicopathologic factors and whole-exome sequencing data. Our analysis has revealed five epitypes (also said as DNA methylation subgroups). Among these five epitypes, four had shown quite an association between supervised and unsupervised gene expression phenotypes along with their differences in genomic instability, global hypomethylation, expression of proliferation-associated genes and promoter hypermethylation, and KRAS and EGFR mutations, while the one remaining epitype had a distinct association with small-cell and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. Thus we found a strong association of adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine epitypes with molecular and clinicopathologic characteristics of lung cancer patients. In this way we see a possibility of a more accurate classification of lung cancer and tailored patient therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c15","authors":["Zhao, Qing-Sheng","Hu, Ling-Ling","Tian, Peng","Wang, Zhi-Dong","Li, Zhao-Pei","Wang, Ai-Wen","Liu, Jing","Qing-Sheng Zhao","Ling-Ling Hu","Peng Tian","Zhi-Dong Wang","Zhao-Pei Li","Ai-Wen Wang","Jing Liu"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13277-015-3826-z","first_seen_on":"2015-09-21T10:20:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1423-0380"],"journal":"Tumor Biology","last_mentioned_on":1457636460,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26386722?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26386722","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s13277-015-3826-z","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s13277-015-3826-z","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs13277-015-3826-z"],"pmid":"26386722","pubdate":"2015-09-21T22:00:15+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Targeted DNA methylation analysis explores association of adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine epitypes with lung cancer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retracted-article-targeted-dna-methylation-analysis-explores-association-adenocarcinoma-neuroendocri"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7377337,"mean":6.4097701099652,"rank":528455,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":6847614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7377337,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232193,"mean":9.2480318443357,"rank":25132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":206965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232193,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1696,"mean":1.0746359882006,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":1687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1696,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":221,"mean":0.67927272727273,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":221,"percentile":99}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":2,"ES":1,"SE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Brianxbio\/statuses\/645905328853266434","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4535985],"posted_on":"2015-09-21T10:20:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Brian Ho","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"Brianxbio","tweeter_id":"215282928","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":54},"tweet_id":"645905328853266434"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Exome_seq\/statuses\/645907591420252160","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4535985],"posted_on":"2015-09-21T10:29:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Exome-seq","url":"http:\/\/genomics.cruk.cam.ac.uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/520305836476755970\/1oHrqeyl_normal.png","description":"A PubMed RSS feed for exome, by dlvr.it, http:\/\/bit.ly\/1qv7gmS, and @CIgenomics","id_on_source":"Exome_seq","tweeter_id":"2820127624","geo":{"lt":52.2,"ln":0.11667,"country":"GB"},"followers":620},"tweet_id":"645907591420252160"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pmctrawler\/statuses\/647428599096569856","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4535985],"posted_on":"2015-09-25T15:13:01+00:00","author":{"name":"PubMed Commons Trawl","url":"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/anonymous\/7167231","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000649264479\/999a1106baee29a2410d5f41eaa8040e_normal.jpeg","description":"Tweets when articles get their first Commons comment.
