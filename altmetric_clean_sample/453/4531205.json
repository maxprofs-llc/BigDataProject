In the present study, we reveal a combination of IFN-\u03b3-irreversible structural and epigenetic defects in HLA class I antigen-processing machinery in a recurrent melanoma metastasis following immunotherapy. These defects include loss of tapasin and one HLA haplotype, as well as selective silencing of HLA-A3 gene responsiveness to IFN-\u03b3. Tapasin loss is caused by a germline frame-shift mutation in exon 3 (TAPBP684delA) along with a somatic loss of the other gene copy. Selective silencing of HLA-A3 gene and its IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness is associated with promoter CpG methylation nearby site-\u03b1 and TATA box, reversible following DNA methyltransferase 1 depletion. This treatment, combined with tapasin reconstitution and IFN-\u03b3 stimulation restored the highest level of HLA class I expression and its ability to elicit cytotoxic T cell responses. These results represent a novel tumor immune evasion mechanism through impairing multiple components at various levels in the HLA class I antigen presentation pathway. These findings may suggest a rational design of combinatorial cancer immunotherapy harnessing DNA demethylation and IFN-\u03b3 response.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Chang, Chien-Chung","Pirozzi, Giuseppe","Wen, Shao-Hsuan","Chung, I-Hsin","Chiu, Bau-Lin","Errico, Simona","Luongo, Monica","Lombardi, Maria Luisa","Ferrone, Soldano"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m115.676130","first_seen_on":"2015-09-19T10:11:04+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1454738286,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26381407?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/290\/44\/26562.short?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26381407","pubdate":"2015-09-19T22:01:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Multiple Structural and Epigenetic Defects in the Human Leukocyte Antigen Class I Antigen Presentation Pathway in a Recurrent Metastatic Melanoma Following Immunotherapy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiple-structural-epigenetic-defects-human-leukocyte-antigen-class-i-antigen-presentation-pathway"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992147,"mean":6.7405564850737,"rank":3609902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4301828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992147,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235226,"mean":9.2816139270911,"rank":95563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":135277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235226,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30822,"mean":3.2093333117031,"rank":20345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":10215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30822,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":392,"mean":5.1301483375959,"rank":156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":392,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
