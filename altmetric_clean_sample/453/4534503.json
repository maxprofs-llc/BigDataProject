One of the immunodominant glycotopes, the trisaccharide Gal\u03b1(1,3)Gal\u03b2(1,4)GlcNAc\u03b1, is expressed on glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored mucins of the infective trypomastigote stage of T. cruzi and triggers high levels of protective anti-\u03b1-Gal antibodies in infected individuals. Here, we have efficiently synthesized the mercaptopropyl glycoside of that glycotope and conjugated it to maleimide-derivatized bovine serum albumin (BSA). Chemiluminescent-ELISA revealed that Gal\u03b1(1,3)Gal\u03b2(1,4)GlcNAc\u03b1-BSA is recognized by purified anti-\u03b1-Gal antibodies from chronic Chagas disease patients \u223c230-fold more strongly than by anti-\u03b1-Gal antibodies from sera of healthy individuals (NHS anti-\u03b1-Gal). Similarly, the pooled sera of chronic Chagas disease patients (ChHSP) recognized Gal\u03b1(1,3)Gal\u03b2(1,4)GlcNAc\u03b1 \u223c20-fold more strongly than pooled NHS. In contrast, the underlying disaccharide Gal\u03b2(1,4)GlcNAc\u03b1, and the monosaccharide GlcNAc\u03b1 or GlcNAc\u03b2 conjugated to BSA are poorly or not recognized by purified anti-\u03b1-Gal antibodies or sera from Chagasic patients or healthy individuals. Our results highlight the importance of the terminal Gal\u03b1 moiety for recognition by Ch anti-\u03b1-Gal antibodies and the lack of antibodies against nonself Gal\u03b2(1,4)GlcNAc\u03b1 and GlcNAc\u03b1 glycotopes. The substantial difference in binding of Ch vs. NHS anti-\u03b1-Gal antibodies to Gal\u03b1(1,3)Gal\u03b2(1,4)GlcNAc\u03b1-BSA suggests that this neoglycoprotein might be suitable for experimental vaccination. To this end, the Gal\u03b1(1,3)Gal\u03b2(1,4)GlcNAc\u03b1-BSA neoglycoprotein was then used to immunize \u03b11,3-galactosyltransferase-knockout mice, which produced antibody titers 40-fold higher as compared to pre-immunization titers. Taken together, our results indicate that the synthetic Gal\u03b1(1,3)Gal\u03b2(1,4)GlcNAc\u03b1 glycotope coupled to a carrier protein could be a potential diagnostic and vaccine candidate for Chagas disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000297c","authors":["Schocker, Nathaniel S","Portillo, Susana","Brito, Carlos R N","Marques, Alexandre F","Almeida, Igor C","Michael, Katja"],"doi":"10.1093\/glycob\/cwv081","first_seen_on":"2015-09-20T20:31:21+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["1460-2423"],"journal":"Glycobiology","last_mentioned_on":1451606400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26384953?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/glycob\/cwv081"],"pmid":"26384953","pubdate":"2015-09-20T22:00:42+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Synthesis of Gal\u03b1(1,3)Gal\u03b2(1,4)GlcNAc\u03b1-, Gal\u03b2(1,4)GlcNAc\u03b1- and GlcNAc-containing neoglycoproteins and their immunological evaluation in the context of Chagas disease","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-gal%CE%B113gal%CE%B214glcnac%CE%B1-gal%CE%B214glcnac%CE%B1-glcnaccontaining-neoglycoproteins-immunological-evaluati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6896042,"mean":6.1898417149761,"rank":687512,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":6199212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6896042,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229574,"mean":9.1311944000384,"rank":33071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":196017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229574,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":528,"mean":3.5339582542695,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":528,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":8.4736842105263,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
