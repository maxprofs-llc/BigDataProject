Mean visual acuities and significant refractive errors were estimated for all the cases. The frequency of amblyopia and strabismus was studied in cases without amblyopia and in cases with medium and high grade amblyopia.\nMean visual acuities were significantly higher in cases of bilateral myopia (p < 0.001) and hyperopia (p < 0.05) compared with unilateral ametropia. The frequency of myopic eyes (p < 0.01), eyes with high grade of myopia (p < 0.002) and anisomyopic eyes (p < 0.001) was significantly higher in cases of high amblyopia compared with cases without amblyopia. Strabismus (p < 0.05) were also significantly more frequent in cases of high amblyopia as well as in cases of myopic eyes (p < 0.01). Moreover, in the group of high amblyopia, 6 cases (6\/7) had developed an intolerance for contact lenses.\nThe risk of developing high grade amblyopia appeared significantly associated with unilateral medium and high level myopia. Strabismus and difficulties with good correction of anisometropia by contact lenses or spectacle appeared to be predisposing factors. This observation would suggest the indication of refractive surgery might be useful in these particular cases. To conclude, this study emphasizes the importance of early treatment of ametropia to reduce the incidence of amblyopia in children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b2c","authors":["Lesueur, L","Chapotot, E","Arne, J L","Perron-Buscail, A","Deneuville, S"],"first_seen_on":"2015-09-21T14:14:34+00:00","issns":["0181-5512"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal Fran\u00e7ais d'Ophtalmologie","last_mentioned_on":1436894399,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9759437?dopt=Citation"],"pmid":"9759437","pubdate":"1998-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"[Predictability of amblyopia in ametropic children.
