Two patients suffered early catastrophic failure and 1 patient developed fracture nonunion, all of wish underwent uneventful conversion to total hip arthroplasty. Three additional patients (11%) had removal of symptomatic implants. The clinical and radiographic outcomes were excellent. Twelve-month MRIs revealed either partial or complete osseous incorporation of 86% the fibular allografts without signs of adverse reaction of the host to the allograft. Femoral head osteonecrosis segments were noted in 76% of patients on MRI; however, radiographically, there were no signs of osteonecrosis or segmental collapse.\nThe fibular allograft reconstructs the comminuted femoral neck, and the osteointegration overtime increases the strength of the host bone-graft interface. This added strength seems to provide the stability needed to better preserve the intraoperative reduction, obtain good outcomes, and reduce the complications associated with FNF.\nTherapeutic Level IV.
