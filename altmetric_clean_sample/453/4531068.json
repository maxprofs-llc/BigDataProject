The same genomic segment encodes for a second shorter protein, termed PA-X, with the first 191 N-terminal aminoacids (aa) identical to PA, but with a completely different C-ter domain of 61 aa, due to a ribosomal frameshifting. In addition, it has been shown that several IAV isolates encode for a naturally truncated PA-X variant, PAX\u0394C20, missing the last 20 aa. The biochemical properties of PA-X and PAX\u0394C20 have been poorly investigated so far. Here, we have carried out an enzymatic characterization of PA-X and its naturally deleted form, in comparison with PA from the human IAV strain A\/WSN\/33 (H1N1). Our results showed, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, that PA-X possesses an endonucleolytic activity. Both PA and PA-X preferentially cut single stranded RNA regions, but with some differences. In addition, we showed that PAX\u0394C20 has severely reduced nuclease activity. These results point to a previously undetected role of the last C-ter 20 aa for the catalytic activity of PA-X and support distinct roles for these proteins in the viral life cycle.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["Bavagnoli, Laura","Cucuzza, Stefano","Campanini, Giulia","Rovida, Francesca","Paolucci, Stefania","Baldanti, Fausto","Maga, Giovanni"],"doi":"10.1093\/nar\/gkv926","first_seen_on":"2015-09-19T10:03:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1362-4962"],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","last_mentioned_on":1446199729,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26384413?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/43\/19\/9405.short?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26384413","pubdate":"2015-09-19T22:00:06+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The novel influenza A virus protein PA-X and its naturally deleted variant show different enzymatic properties in comparison to the viral endonuclease PA","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-influenza-virus-protein-pax-naturally-deleted-variant-show-different-enzymatic-properties-comp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6507444,"mean":6.0294063692903,"rank":2882727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3450240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6507444,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202152,"mean":9.9237893356945,"rank":99483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":93987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202152,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9602,"mean":4.0566272263306,"rank":6361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":2917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9602,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289,"mean":4.9601388888889,"rank":200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
