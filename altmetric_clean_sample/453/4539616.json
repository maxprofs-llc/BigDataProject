Unstimulated (UWS) and stimulated whole saliva (SWS) were collected during the menstrual cycle. The expression level of oral mucosal MUC1 was analyzed. 17\u03b2-Estradiol, progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), cortisol, chromogranin A (CgA), and blood contamination levels were measured from UWS and SWS.\nSignificant positive correlations were observed between 17\u03b2-estradiol and DHEA in UWS, cortisol and CgA in UWS, MUC1 expression and DHEA in SWS, and among cortisol, progesterone, and DHEA in UWS and SWS. Significant negative correlations were observed between MUC1 and cortisol\/DHEA ratio in UWS and SWS. When each phase was analyzed individually, MUC1 expression showed significant negative correlations with cortisol, progesterone, and cortisol\/DHEA ratio in UWS and with progesterone and cortisol\/DHEA ratio in SWS during the mid-luteal phase. A significant negative correlation was also observed between MUC1 and cortisol\/DHEA ratio in UWS during the late-luteal phase.\nStress-related psychoendocrinological interactions throughout the menstrual cycle resulted in a decrease in oral mucosal epithelial MUC1 expression and a weakening of oral mucosal defense.
