We then followed this cohort over a 7 year period, recording primary outcome measures of occurrence of first seizure, status epilepticus, stroke-like episode, and death.\nThe overall prevalence of epilepsy in the cohort was 23.1%. The mean age of epilepsy onset was 29.4 years. The prevalence varied widely between genotypes, with several genotypes having no cases of epilepsy, a prevalence of 34.9% in the most common genotype (m.3243A>G mutation), and 92.3% in the m.8344A>G mutation. Among the cohort as a whole, focal seizures, with or without progression to bilateral convulsive seizures, was the most common seizure type. Conversely, all of the patients with the m.8344A>G mutation and epilepsy experienced myoclonic seizures. Patients with the m.3243A>G mutation remain at high risk of developing stroke-like episodes (1.16% per year). However, although the standardized mortality ratio for the entire cohort was high (2.86), this ratio did not differ significantly between patients with epilepsy (2.96) and those without (2.83).\nEpilepsy is a common manifestation of mitochondrial disease. It develops early in the disease, and in the case of the m.3243A>G mutation often presents in the context of a stroke-like episode or status epilepticus. However, epilepsy does not itself appear to contribute to the increased mortality in mitochondrial disease. This article is protected by copyright.
