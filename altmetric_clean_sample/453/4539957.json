Treatment was well tolerated with only occasional, mild-moderate, transient injection reactions. Lymphocytosis decreased in all patients (maximum decrease, 5-91%), with 12 patients obtaining >50% decreases. Of 14 patients with lymphadenopathy on CT imaging, 5 (36%) achieved 14-61% reductions (sum of perpendicular diameters). By NCI-WG criteria, 2 patients achieved partial responses (10%). SC veltuzumab appeared active in all dose groups, with no obvious exposure-response relationship, despite cumulative doses ranging from 320 to 5120 mg. Overall median progression-free survival was 7.7 months; 3 patients remained progression-free >1 year (2 ongoing at 2-year study completion). These data suggest further studies of SC veltuzumab in CLL are warranted.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004181","authors":["Kalaycio, Matt E","Negrea, O George","Allen, Steven L","Rai, Kanti R","Abbasi, Rashid M","Horne, Heather","Wegener, William A","Goldenberg, David M"],"doi":"10.3109\/10428194.2015.1085531","first_seen_on":"2015-09-22T10:09:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1029-2403"],"journal":"Leukemia & Lymphoma","last_mentioned_on":1445381858,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26389849?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.3109\/10428194.2015.1085531"],"pmid":"26389849","pubdate":"2015-09-22T22:00:19+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["neoplasms","hematology"],"title":"Subcutaneous injections of low doses of humanized anti-CD20 veltuzumab: A phase I study in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/subcutaneous-injections-low-doses-humanized-anticd20-veltuzumab-phase-i-study-chronic-lymphocytic-le"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6348733,"mean":5.9808086398984,"rank":2988718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1898561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6348733,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191114,"mean":10.179496444512,"rank":101655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":69784,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191114,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":933,"mean":1.7580751072961,"rank":363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":933,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.8116666666667,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
