Here, the metabolic response of both tomato and Arabidopsis thaliana to V. dahliae infection was analysed by first using non-targeted GC-MS profiling. The leaf content of both major cell wall components glucuronic acid and xylose was reduced in the presence of the pathogen in tomato but enhanced in A. thaliana. The leaf content of the two tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates fumaric acid and succinic acid was increased in the leaf of both species, reflecting a likely higher demand for reducing equivalents required for defence responses. A prominent group of affected compounds was amino acids and based on the targeted analysis in the root, it was shown that the level of 12 and four free amino acids was enhanced by the infection in, respectively, tomato and A. thaliana, with leucine and histidine being represented in both host species. The leaf content of six free amino acids was reduced in the leaf tissue of diseased A. thaliana plants, while that of two free amino acids was raised in the tomato plants. This study emphasizes the role of primary plant metabolites in adaptive responses when the fungus has colonized the plant.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Anja Buhtz","Katja Witzel","Nadine Strehmel","J\u00f6rg Ziegler","Steffen Abel","Rita Grosch","Buhtz, Anja","Witzel, Katja","Strehmel, Nadine","Ziegler, J\u00f6rg","Abel, Steffen","Grosch, Rita"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0138242","first_seen_on":"2015-09-20T06:46:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1465527969,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0138242","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26381754?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0138242.PDF","pmid":"26381754","pubdate":"2015-09-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0138242","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Perturbations in the Primary Metabolism of Tomato and Arabidopsis thaliana Plants Infected with the Soil-Borne Fungus Verticillium dahliae","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/perturbations-primary-metabolism-tomato-arabidopsis-thaliana-plants-infected-soilborne-fungus-vertic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7879571,"mean":6.6725285125901,"rank":5694837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1903816,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7879571,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234348,"mean":9.2967897946208,"rank":146663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":72372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234348,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110818,"mean":10.313010440637,"rank":75292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":30024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110818,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5856,"mean":8.76821588386,"rank":3927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":1583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5856,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
