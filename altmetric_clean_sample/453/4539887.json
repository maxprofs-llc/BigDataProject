Since transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and its signaling also are principally implicated in either modulating gastric mucosal inflammatory responses or causing carcinogenesis and are attenuated after H. pylori infection, we hypothesized that dysregulated Smad signaling and repressed TGF-\u03b2 might be core pathogenic mechanism for H. pylori-associated gastritis or carcinogenesis. Until now, no precise underlying mechanism how deranged TGF-\u03b2 signaling developed after H. pylori infection relevant to various clinical manifestations remains unclear. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism about the inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by H. pylori CagA protein. H. pylori CagA significantly suppressed TGF-\u03b2\/Smad transcriptional responses through critical inhibition of Smad3, though CagA interacted constitutively with Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4. CagA inhibited TGF-\u03b2-induced suppression of proinflammatory chemokines, such as IL-8, CXCL1 and CXCL3, as well as TGF-\u03b2-induced transcription of target genes. In conclusion, repressed TGF-\u03b2 signaling associated with CagA-positive H. pylori infection could be an important determinant for the outcome of H. pylori infection. Therefore, TGF-\u03b2 signaling is one of the important determinants to avoid from H. pylori CagA pathogenicity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc3e","authors":["Nguyen, Thuy Trang","Kim, Seong-Jin","Park, Jong Min","Hahm, Ki Baik","Lee, Ho-Jae"],"doi":"10.3164\/jcbn.15-38","first_seen_on":"2015-09-22T10:05:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0912-0009"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Clinical Biochemistry and Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1442916304,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26388668?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26388668","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Repressed TGF-\u03b2 signaling through CagA-Smad3 interaction as pathogenic mechanisms of Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis.","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/repressed-tgf%CE%B2-signaling-through-cagasmad3-interaction-pathogenic-mechanisms-helicobacter-pyloriasso"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6387250,"mean":5.8558623845718,"rank":5442263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6387250,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200606,"mean":9.8823232521622,"rank":160136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200606,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160,"mean":3.9118993710692,"rank":128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.8923076923077,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
