However, the response of descendants from heteromorphic seeds to stress has not been well documented. Suaeda aralocaspica is a typical annual halophyte, which produces heteromorphic seeds with disparate forms and different germination characteristics. To gain an understanding of the salt tolerance of descendants and the impact of seed heteromorphism on progeny of this species, we performed a series of experiments to investigate the plant growth and physiological parameters (e.g. osmolytes, oxidative\/antioxidative agents and enzymes), as well as expression patterns of corresponding genes. Results showed osmolytes (proline and glycinebetaine) were significantly increased and that excess reactive oxygen species (O2 (-), H2O2) produced under high salinity were scavenged by increased levels of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase) and corresponding antioxidants (ascorbic acid and glutathione). Moreover, enhancement of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) activity at high salt intensity had a positive effect on photosynthesis. The descendants from heteromorphic seeds presented no significant difference in performance with or without salinity. In conclusion, we found that high salinity induced the same active physiological responses in plants from heteromorphic seeds of S. aralocaspica, there was no carry-over of seed heteromorphism to plants: all the descendants required salinity for optimal growth and adaptation to their natural habitat.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a7b","authors":["Cao, Jing","Lv, Xiu Yun","Chen, Ling","Xing, Jia Jia","Lan, Hai Yan"],"doi":"10.1093\/aobpla\/plv112","first_seen_on":"2015-09-20T13:02:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-2851"],"journal":"AoB Plants","last_mentioned_on":1450217717,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26386128?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/aobpla.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/7\/plv112.full.pdf?ct"],"pmid":"26386128","pubdate":"2015-09-17T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Effects of salinity on the growth, physiology and relevant gene expression of an annual halophyte grown from heteromorphic seeds","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-salinity-growth-physiology-relevant-gene-expression-annual-halophyte-grown-heteromorphic-see"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6771968,"mean":6.1646290473641,"rank":4783309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1744105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6771968,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229111,"mean":9.115996394745,"rank":140967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":72993,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229111,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":339,"mean":6.1786272189349,"rank":256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":339,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":5.43775,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
