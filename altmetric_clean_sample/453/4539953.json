Exciting developments made possible by modern tools of synthetic biology has stimulated emergence of modular VLPs, whereby parts of one pathogen are by design integrated into a less harmful VLP which has preferential physical and manufacturing character. This strategy allows the immunologically protective parts of a pathogen to be displayed on the most-suitable VLP. However, the field of modular VLP design is immature, and robust design principles are yet to emerge, particularly for larger antigenic structures. Here we use a combination of molecular dynamic simulation and experiment to reveal two key design principles for VLPs. First, the linkers connecting the integrated antigenic module with the VLP-forming protein must be well designed to ensure structural separation and independence. Second, the number of antigenic domains on the VLP surface must be sufficiently below the maximum such that a \"steric barrier\" to VLP formation cannot exist. This second principle leads to designs whereby co-expression of modular protein with unmodified VLP-forming protein can titrate down the amount of antigen on the surface of the VLP, to the point where assembly can proceed. In this work we elucidate these principles by displaying the 18.1kDa VP8* domain from rotavirus on the murine polyomavirus VLP, and show functional presentation of the antigenic structure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ea","authors":["Lua, Linda H L","Fan, Yuanyuan","Chang, Cindy","Connors, Natalie K","Middelberg, Anton P J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vaccine.2015.09.017","first_seen_on":"2015-09-22T10:09:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2518"],"journal":"Vaccine","last_mentioned_on":1442929896,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26387437?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26387437","pubdate":"2015-09-22T22:01:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Synthetic biology design to display an 18kDa rotavirus large antigen on a modular virus-like particle.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthetic-biology-design-display-18kda-rotavirus-large-antigen-modular-viruslike-particle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6387250,"mean":5.8558623845718,"rank":4720084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":945092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6387250,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200606,"mean":9.882322005932,"rank":138003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":40471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200606,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3741,"mean":6.740114973262,"rank":2700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3741,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149,"mean":6.8361756756757,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
