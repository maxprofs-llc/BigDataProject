In addition to visual acuities and treatments throughout the clinical course, specific dimensions of the macular hole, including diameters, height, configuration, shape, and the presence of a cuff of fluid were examined using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT).\nTwenty-eight patients were identified with a mean initial visual acuity (VA) of logMAR 1.3 (20\/400) and a mean follow-up of 2.2 years. Eleven holes (39.3%) closed spontaneously in median 5.7 weeks. Eleven underwent vitrectomy with a median time to intervention of 35.1 weeks. Median time to surgery for the 5 eyes with successful hole closure was 11.0 weeks vs. 56.3 weeks for the 6 eyes that failed to close (P=.02). VA improved in closed holes (P<.01), whether spontaneously (P<.01) or via vitrectomy (P=.04), but VA did not improve in holes that did not close (P=.22). There was no relation between initial OCT dimensions and final hole closure status, although there was a trend that did not reach statistical significance towards small dimensions for those that closed spontaneously.\nA fairly high spontaneous closure rate was observed, with a trend towards smaller OCT dimensions. We found no relationship between hole closure and the OCT characteristics of the hole. Surgical intervention was less successful at hole closure when elected after 3 months.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002205","authors":["Miller, John B","Yonekawa, Yoshihiro","Eliott, Dean","Kim, Ivana K","Kim, Leo A","Loewenstein, John I","Sobrin, Lucia","Young, Lucy H","Mukai, Shizuo","Vavvas, Demetrios G"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajo.2015.09.004","first_seen_on":"2015-09-20T00:27:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0002-9394","1879-1891"],"journal":"American Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1448479472,"links":["http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002-9394(15)00556-5\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002-9394(15)00556-5\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002-9394(15)00556-5\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002-9394(15)00556-5\/fulltext","http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002-9394(15)00556-5\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002939415005565\/pdf","pmid":"26393438","pubdate":"2015-09-24T22:02:10+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Long-term Follow-up and Outcomes in Traumatic Macular Holes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-followup-outcomes-traumatic-macular-holes-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6606474,"mean":6.1300731649094,"rank":2277927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4278898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6606474,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203351,"mean":9.977935234817,"rank":71152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":130220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203351,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1804,"mean":2.2369872434831,"rank":564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":1229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1804,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":2.8694805194805,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BO":1,"GB":1,"PE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rocoar73\/statuses\/645393703968702464","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4532890],"posted_on":"2015-09-20T00:27:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Rodrigo Cortes, M.D.","url":"http:\/\/www.fbo-bo.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/519622712302379008\/ApgrbZyF_normal.jpeg","description":"Medico -
