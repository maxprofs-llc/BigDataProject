Eight fluorescent glycosides containing either galactose or 5-thiogalactose as the terminal sugar were enzymatically synthesized using galactosyltransferases, with lactosyl glycosides as acceptors and UDP-galactose or UDP-5'-thiogalactose, respectively, as donors. The glycosides were incubated with human \u03b1-galactosidase A (CAZy family GH27, a retaining glycosidase), Bacteroides fragilis \u03b1-1,3-galactosidase (GH110, an inverting glycosidase), or homogenates of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells or NG108-15 rat glioma cells. Substrate hydrolysis was monitored by capillary electrophoresis with fluorescence detection. All compounds containing terminal O-galactose were readily degraded. Their 5-thiogalactose counterparts were resistant to hydrolysis by human \u03b1-galactosidase A and the enzymes present in the cell extracts. B. fragilis \u03b1-1,3-galactosidase hydrolyzed both thio- and O-galactoside substrates; however, the thiogalactosides were hydrolyzed at only 1-3 % of the rate of O-galactosides. The hydrolytic resistance of 5-thiogalactose was also confirmed by an in vivo study using cells in culture. The results suggest that 5-thiogalactosides may be useful tools for the study of anabolic pathways in cell extracts or in single cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dd9","authors":["Adlercreutz, Dietlind","Yoshimura, Yayoi","Mannerstedt, Karin","Wakarchuk, Warren W.","Bennett, Eric P.","Dovichi, Norman J.","Hindsgaul, Ole","Palcic, Monica M."],"doi":"10.1002\/cbic.201200155","endpage":"1679","first_seen_on":"2012-07-03T07:53:37+00:00","issns":["1439-7633","1439-4227"],"issue":"11","journal":"ChemBioChem","last_mentioned_on":1341302002,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201200155\/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+7+July+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201200155\/pdf","pmid":"22740420","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1673","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Thiogalactopyranosides are Resistant to Hydrolysis by \u00e2\u0080\u0090Galactosidases","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thiogalactopyranosides-resistant-hydrolysis-%CE%B1galactosidases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6324436,"mean":5.9767388233103,"rank":2974487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1891710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6324436,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82085,"mean":5.5063925734613,"rank":38711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":32015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82085,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1472,"mean":1.6983562202583,"rank":367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":988,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1472,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":4.5371428571429,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
