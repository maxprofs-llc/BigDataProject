Virus-specific CTLs recognize specific viral peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex class-I (MHC-I) on the surface of virus-infected target cells via their T cell receptor (TCR) and eliminate target cells by both direct and indirect mechanisms. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections, host immune responses fail to contain the virus and allow persistent viral replication, leading to AIDS progression. CTL responses exert strong suppressive pressure on HIV\/SIV replication and cumulative studies have indicated association of HLA\/MHC-I genotypes with rapid or slow AIDS progression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc10","authors":["Takushi Nomura","Tetsuro Matano"],"doi":"10.3389\/fmicb.2012.00234","first_seen_on":"2012-07-04T13:06:12+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1664-302X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1341407151,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22754552?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3386493","pmid":"22754552","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Association of MHC-I genotypes with disease progression in HIV\/SIV infections","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-mhci-genotypes-disease-progression-hivsiv-infections"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3070952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":947722,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75426,"mean":5.0944542260524,"rank":48397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":14949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75426,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2654,"mean":2.8298477195628,"rank":1946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":491,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2654,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
