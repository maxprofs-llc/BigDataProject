PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"Angioneurines are a family of molecules that include vascular growth factors such as VEGF, neurotrophins such as BDNF, IGF-I, and Erythropoietin, among others. They affect both neural and vascular processes. Due to the fact that all of them act over glia, we propose the term angioglioneurins to name them. They play a key role in the neurogliovascular unit that represents the functional core maintaining BBB. Although delivery to CNS is still an unsolved problem nowadays, exogenous angioglioneurin administration represents a promising therapeutic strategy for many neurological pathologies due to their neurotrophic and neurogenic role. In brains, VEGF is produced by neurons and astrocytes in different stages and situation, binding to tyrosine kinase receptors and also to neuropilin family. This fact reinforces its key role in the cross talk between neural and vascular development and activity. Angioglioneurins described in this report might become an important therapeutic resource in CNS restoration, especially in pathologies as stroke or traumatic brain injury.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9113cf058f61000cc78","authors":["Lafuente, Jos\u00e9 Vicente","Ortuzar, Naiara","Bengoetxea, Harkaitz","Bulnes, Susana","Argando\u00f1a, Enrike G"],"doi":"10.1016\/b978-0-12-386986-9.00012-0","first_seen_on":"2012-07-04T10:23:52+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0074-7742","2162-5514"],"journal":"International review of neurobiology","last_mentioned_on":1341412440,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22748835?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22748835","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["biology","neurology"],"title":"Vascular endothelial growth factor and other angioglioneurins: key molecules in brain development and restoration.","type":"article","volume":"102","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vascular-endothelial-growth-factor-other-angioglioneurins-key-molecules-brain-development-restoratio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":4207178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77807,"mean":5.3551243862941,"rank":64435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77807,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235,"mean":2.8612820512821,"rank":175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
