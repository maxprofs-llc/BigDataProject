The ASSR has been suggested to reflect the efficiency of \u03b3-amino butyric acid (GABA) inhibitory interneuronal activity. Although a potential role for GABAergic dysfunction has been previously proposed, the role of neural synchronization in the ASSR in people with bipolar disorder (BD) has received little attention. In the current study, we investigated ASSRs to 20 Hz, 30 Hz, 40 Hz and 80 Hz click trains in BD patients. A total of 14 (4 males) BD patients and 25 (10 males) healthy controls participated in this study. ASSRs were obtained using whole-head 306-channel magnetoencephalography to calculate, ASSR power values and phase locking factors (PLF). BD patients exhibited significantly reduced mean ASSR power and PLF values bilaterally at frequencies of 30, 40, and 80 Hz (p<0.05 for these frequencies). At 20 Hz, bipolar patients showed no significant reduction in mean ASSR power and PLF values. There was a significant negative correlation between 80 Hz-ASSR-power values obtained from the right hemisphere and scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (rho\u200a=\u200a-0.86, p\u200a=\u200a0.0003). The current study showed reduced low and high gamma band ASSR power and PLF bilaterally with no significant beta band ASSR reduction in BD patients. BD patients are characterized by deficits in gamma band oscillations, which may be associated with GABA inhibitory interneuronal activity dysfunction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yuko Oda","Toshiaki Onitsuka","Rikako Tsuchimoto","Shogo Hirano","Naoya Oribe","Takefumi Ueno","Yoji Hirano","Itta Nakamura","Tomofumi Miura","Shigenobu Kanba"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0039955","first_seen_on":"2012-07-05T21:18:42+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1343606400,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0039955?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0039955.pdf","pmid":"22792199","pubdate":"2012-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e39955","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Gamma Band Neural Synchronization Deficits for Auditory Steady State Responses in Bipolar Disorder Patients","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gamma-band-neural-synchronization-deficits-auditory-steady-state-responses-bipolar-disorder-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8059414,"mean":6.8395785174396,"rank":3431968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4592540,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8059414,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94508,"mean":5.774230670744,"rank":34201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":59811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94508,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112178,"mean":10.547821318096,"rank":47016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":64473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112178,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3143,"mean":8.2003004455761,"rank":1288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3143,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
