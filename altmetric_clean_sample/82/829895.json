A full-length fragment of MfMIPS1 cDNA was cloned from Medicago falcata that is more cold-tolerant than Medicago sativa. While MfMIPS1 transcript was induced in response to cold, dehydration and salt stress, MIPS transcript and myo-inositol were maintained longer and at a higher level in M. falcata than in M. sativa during cold acclimation at 5 \u00b0C. MfMIPS1 transcript was induced by hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2)) and nitric oxide (NO), but was not responsive to abscisic acid (ABA). Pharmacological experiments revealed that H(2) O(2) and NO are involved in the regulation of MfMIPS1 expression by cold and dehydration, but not by salt. Overexpression of MfMIPS1 in tobacco increased the MIPS activity and levels of myo-inositol, galactinol and raffinose, resulting in enhanced resistance to chilling, drought and salt stresses in transgenic tobacco plants. It is suggested that MfMIPS1 is induced by diverse environmental factors and confers resistance to various abiotic stresses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003340","authors":["TAN, JIALI","WANG, CONGYING","XIANG, BIN","HAN, RUIHONG","GUO, ZHENFEI","Tan, Jiali","Wang, Congying","Xiang, Bin","Han, Ruihong","Guo, Zhenfei"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-3040.2012.02573.x","endpage":"299","first_seen_on":"2012-07-10T00:48:03+00:00","issns":["1365-3040","0140-7791"],"issue":"2","journal":"Plant, Cell & Environment","last_mentioned_on":1343914581,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-3040.2012.02573.x\/abstract;jsessionid=B223EAA17FB71EC516826B7C2B964E1E.d01t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-3040.2012.02573.x\/abstract;jsessionid=9D1B17D925A7EF8D459B7F8BE6A6B152.d04t04?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+4+August+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-3040.2012.02573.x\/abstract;jsessionid=D5BBF430218ED2EC4133CAC47C63FC17.d04t01?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+4+August+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-3040.2012.02573.x\/abstract;jsessionid=57F251F6209B2365DE4F35867345457A.d01t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-3040.2012.02573.x\/pdf","pmid":"22774933","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"288","subjects":["cellbiology","botany"],"title":"Hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide mediated cold\u00e2\u0080\u0090 and dehydration\u00e2\u0080\u0090induced myo\u00e2\u0080\u0090inositol phosphate synthase that confers multiple resistances to abiotic stresses","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hydrogen-peroxide-nitric-oxide-mediated-cold-dehydrationinduced-myoinositol-phosphate-synthase-confe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6279205,"mean":5.9864315817751,"rank":2953896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1875538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6279205,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81880,"mean":5.5529095616702,"rank":38842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":31780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81880,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":703,"mean":2.5111225071225,"rank":246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":703,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":3,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
