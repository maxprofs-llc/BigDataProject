Here we present the broadest tissue catalogue of phosphoproteins to date, covering 31,480 phosphorylation sites on 7,280 proteins quantified across 14 rat organs and tissues. We provide the data set as an easily accessible resource via a web-based database, the CPR PTM Resource. A major fraction of the presented phosphorylation sites are tissue-specific and modulate protein interaction networks that are essential for the function of individual organs. For skeletal muscle, we find that phosphotyrosines are over-represented, which is mainly due to proteins involved in glycogenolysis and muscle contraction, a finding we validate in human skeletal muscle biopsies. Tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in both skeletal and cardiac muscle contraction, whereas glycogenolytic enzymes are tyrosine phosphorylated in skeletal muscle but not in the liver. The presented phosphoproteomic method is simple and rapid, making it applicable for screening of diseased tissue samples.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012NatCo...3E.876L","altmetric_jid":"ads","authors":["Lundby A","Secher A","Lage K","Nordsborg NB","Dmytriyev A","Lundby C","Olsen JV"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms1871","first_seen_on":"2012-07-06T19:15:29+00:00","issns":["","2041-1733","2041-1723"],"issue":"","journal":"Astrophysics Data System (ADS)","last_mentioned_on":1474126187,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22673903","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ncomms1871","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22673903"],"pmid":"22673903","pubdate":"2012-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"876","subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"Quantitative maps of protein phosphorylation sites across 14 different rat organs and tissues","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-maps-protein-phosphorylation-sites-across-14-different-rat-organs-tissues"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":1850956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6480283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95365,"mean":5.831289249612,"rank":20308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":74356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95365,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16552,"mean":4.6737502265724,"rank":3707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":12580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16552,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151,"mean":5.3020133333333,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":11,"Researcher":31,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
