However, synchronization also plays a fundamental role in cognitive processing, and the level of theta and higher frequency band synchronization is modulated during WM. Yet, little is known about the link between BOLD, EEG power, and EEG synchronization during WM, and how these measures develop with human brain maturation or relate to behavioral changes. We examined EEG-BOLD signal correlations from 18 young adults and 15 school-aged children for age-dependent effects during a load-modulated Sternberg WM task. Frontal load (in-)dependent EEG theta power was significantly enhanced in children compared to adults, while adults showed stronger fMRI load effects. Children demonstrated a stronger negative correlation between global theta power and the BOLD signal in the default mode network relative to adults. Therefore, we conclude that theta power mediates the suppression of a task-irrelevant network. We further conclude that children suppress this network even more than adults, probably from an increased level of task-preparedness to compensate for not fully mature cognitive functions, reflected in lower response accuracy and increased reaction time. In contrast to power, correlations between instantaneous theta global field synchronization and the BOLD signal were exclusively positive in both age groups but only significant in adults in the frontal-parietal and posterior cingulate cortices. Furthermore, theta synchronization was weaker in children and was--in contrast to EEG power--positively correlated with response accuracy in both age groups. In summary we conclude that theta EEG-BOLD signal correlations differ between spectral power and synchronization and that these opposite correlations with different distributions undergo similar and significant neuronal developments with brain maturation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Lars Michels","Rafael L\u00fcchinger","Thomas Koenig","Ernst Martin","Daniel Brandeis"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0039447","first_seen_on":"2012-07-08T13:03:31+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1399496657,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0039447?buffer_share=0ff9c","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3391196\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0039447.pdf","pmid":"22792176","pubdate":"2012-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e39447","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Developmental Changes of BOLD Signal Correlations with Global Human EEG Power and Synchronization during Working Memory","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/developmental-changes-bold-signal-correlations-global-human-eeg-power-synchronization-during-working-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3728350,"mean":4.9786509961014,"rank":1486937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2194514,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3728350,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73255,"mean":4.7270925000682,"rank":20688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":51646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73255,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65790,"mean":8.2973814771466,"rank":23519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":41099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65790,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3217,"mean":5.7957325870647,"rank":1023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3217,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
