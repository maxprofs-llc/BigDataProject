HUB1-mediated regulation of gene expression played a role in periodic and inducible processes such as the cell cycle, dormancy, flowering time and defense responses. Here, we determined the effects of the hub1-1 mutation on expression of a set of diurnally induced circadian clock genes identified from a comparative microarray analysis between the hub1-1 mutant and an HUB1 over-expression line. The hub1-1 mutation reduced the amplitudes of a number of induced clock gene expression peaks, as well as the HUB1-mediated histone H2BUb and H3K4Me3 marks associated with the coding regions, suggesting a role for HUB1 in facilitating transcriptional elongation in plants. Furthermore, double mutants between hub1-1 and elongata (elo) showed an embryo-lethal phenotype, indicating a synergistic genetic interaction. The double mutant embryos arrested at the torpedo stage, implying that together histone ubiquitination and acetylation marks are essential to activate expression of target genes in multiple pathways.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003338","authors":["Himanen K","Woloszynska M","Boccardi TM","De Groeve S","Bruno L","Vuylsteke M","Van Lijsebettens M","Himanen, Kristiina","Woloszynska, Magdalena","Boccardi, Tommaso M.","De Groeve, Steven","Nelissen, Hilde","Bruno, Leonardo","Vuylsteke, Marnik","Van Lijsebettens, Mieke"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-313x.2012.05071.x","endpage":"260","first_seen_on":"2012-07-05T14:25:19+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-3062551","handles":["1854\/LU-3062551"],"issns":["1365-313X","0960-7412","09607412"],"issue":"2","journal":"Plant Journal","last_mentioned_on":1341498298,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-313X.2012.05071.x\/abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1365-313X.2012.05071.x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-313X.2012.05071.x\/pdf","pmid":"22762858","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"249","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","botany"],"title":"Histone H2B monoubiquitination is required to reach maximal transcript levels of circadian clock genes in Arabidopsis","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/histone-h2b-monoubiquitination-required-reach-maximal-transcript-levels-circadian-clock-genes-arabid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230816,"mean":5.9681227261619,"rank":2927340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1858865,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230816,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81451,"mean":5.5146552486187,"rank":38541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":31727,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81451,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1726,"mean":2.7673344927536,"rank":851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1726,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
