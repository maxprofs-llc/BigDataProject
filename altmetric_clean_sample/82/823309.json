Such SiNPs feature excellent aqueous dispersibility, are strongly fluorescent, storable, photostable, stable at different pH values, and biocompatible. The method opens new avenues for designing multifunctional SiNPs and related silicon nanostructures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Zhong, Yiling","Peng, Fei","Wei, Xinpan","Zhou, Yanfeng","Wang, Jie","Jiang, Xiangxu","Su, Yuanyuan","Su, Shao","Lee, Shuit\u2010Tong","He, Yao","Zhong Y","Peng F","Wei X","Zhou Y","Wang J","Jiang X","Su Y","Su S","Lee ST","He Y"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201202085","endpage":"8489","first_seen_on":"2012-07-05T01:38:03+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"34","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
