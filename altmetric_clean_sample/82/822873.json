Based on the findings of this study, several conclusions were drawn: (1) There is a significant difference in changes over time in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure between petting a dog with whom a companion bond has been established and petting a dog with whom no bond exists; (2) the decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that occur during petting a dog with whom a companion bond has been established parallel the relaxation effect of quiet reading; and (3) there is a \" greeting response\" to the entry of a dog with whom a companion bond has been established, which results in significantly higher systolic and diastolic pressures than the response either to an unknown dog or to reading.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa70a3cf058f61000a620","authors":["Baun, M M","Bergstrom, N","Langston, N F","Thoma, L"],"first_seen_on":"2012-07-04T17:23:15+00:00","issns":["0029-6562"],"issue":"3","journal":"Nursing Research (New York)","last_mentioned_on":1490121780,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6563527","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6563527"],"pmid":"6563527","pubdate":"1984-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Physiological effects of human\/companion animal bonding.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physiological-effects-humancompanion-animal-bonding"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.58,"score_history":{"1y":5.08,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.58},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":1052896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7337420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95354,"mean":5.8768193764224,"rank":11764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":83581,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95354,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":727,"mean":3.5942975206612,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":727,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.82,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
