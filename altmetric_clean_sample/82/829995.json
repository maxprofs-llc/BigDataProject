The slightly distorted octa-hedral coordination environment of the two Fe(II) ions is completed by two monodentate aqua ligands and two thio-cyanate ligands. One of the 1,4-bis-(4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)benzene mol-ecules lies across an inversion center. In the crystal, O-H\u22efN hydrogen bonds connect the components, forming a two-dimensional network parallel to (011). In addition, \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking inter-actions involving the benzene and triazole rings, with centroid-centroid distances in the range 3.502\u2005(5)-3.787\u2005(6)\u2005\u00c5, connect the two-dimensional hydrogen-bonded network into a three-dimensional network.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ea","authors":["Du, G.-X."],"doi":"10.1107\/s1600536812026141","first_seen_on":"2012-07-10T02:39:01+00:00","issns":["1600-5368"],"journal":"Acta Crystallographica: Section E (International Union of Crystallography - IUCr)","last_mentioned_on":1341887518,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper_yard?lh5483&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/e\/issues\/2012\/08\/00\/lh5483\/lh5483.pdf","pmid":"22904716","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"title":"The triclinic form of di-\u00ce\u00bc-aqua-bis\u00c2\u00ad[diaqua\u00c2\u00adbis\u00c2\u00ad(thio\u00c2\u00adcyanato-\u00ce\u00baN)iron(II)]\u00e2\u0080\u00931,4-bis\u00c2\u00ad(4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)benzene (1\/3)","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/triclinic-form-di%CE%BCaquabisdiaquabisthiocyanatokn-ironii14bis4h124triazol4ylbenzene-13"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3070754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":947532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75492,"mean":5.1412356969705,"rank":48567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":14836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75492,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1462,"mean":0.57065297741273,"rank":330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1462,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":0.96127272727273,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/IUCr\/status\/222518497241079808","citation_ids":[829995],"posted_on":"2012-07-10T02:31:58+00:00","author":{"name":"IUCr","url":"http:\/\/www.iucr.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/586153889533145088\/vS5Kc1h5_normal.jpg","description":"Publications and activities of the International Union of Crystallography","id_on_source":"IUCr","tweeter_id":"84666459","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1784},"tweet_id":"222518497241079808"}]}}
