PH is usually diagnosed in patients presenting with a seizure disorder, when neuroimaging demonstrates the ectopically placed nodules of neurons. PH is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder. The most commonly identified genetic cause is the X-linked dominant inheritance of mutations in the Filamin A (FLNA) gene. Multiple lines of evidence support the contribution of genetic factors in dyslexia. As dyslexia does not show a single-gene pattern of inheritance, it is classified as a complex genetic disorder. We have recently identified a specific reading fluency deficit in a variable group of patients with PH, in the context of normal intelligence. Here, we present a study of a mother-daughter pair who share bilateral widespread gray matter heterotopia caused by a novel mutation in FLNA and the same pattern of X-chromosome inactivation but who exhibit divergent reading and cognitive profiles. This novel observation highlights the uncertainty of using heterotopia anatomy in clinical practice to predict behavioral outcome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f61000697d","authors":["Reinstein, Eyal","Chang, Bernard S.","Robertson, Stephen P.","Rimoin, David L.","Katzir, Tami"],"doi":"10.1002\/ajmg.a.35455","endpage":"1901","first_seen_on":"2012-07-05T09:56:45+00:00","issns":["1552-4833","1552-4825"],"issue":"8","journal":"American Journal of Medical Genetics.
