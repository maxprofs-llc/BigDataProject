In neo-vascularized (NV) brains, we analyzed the number and area of blood vessels and the expression of VEGF and HIF-1\u03b1. The IHC results showed that the number and area of blood vessels, as assessed by immunolabeling for von Willebrand factor, was higher in the NV brain than in the control brain. The Western blot results showed that the level of VEGF was increased, predominantly in NV brain of the cerebral cortex relative to the clinically normal cerebral cortex, whereas the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in NV brains was not different from the control brains. Our study showed that dilatation of vessels and development of new vessels in the cerebral cortex were observed in cases of canine CNS disease and found increased expression of VEGF in canine brains with neo-vascularization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dbb","authors":["Yu, Chi-Ho","Yhee, Ji-Young","Kim, Jong-Hyuk","Im, Keum-Soon","Kim, Na-Hyun","Kwon, So-Young","Hur, Tai-Young","Sur, Jung-Hyang"],"first_seen_on":"2012-07-04T10:17:40+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0830-9000","1928-9022"],"issue":"1","journal":"Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research","last_mentioned_on":1341397043,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22754097?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3244290","pmid":"22754097","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in neo-vascularized canine brain tissue.","type":"article","volume":"76","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-expression-vascular-endothelial-growth-factor-neovascularized-canine-brain-tissue-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":4206764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77809,"mean":5.355180161423,"rank":64457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77809,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":1.8838969072165,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.0333333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VEGFRSSfeeds\/statuses\/220461295852453891","license":"public","citation_ids":[822187],"posted_on":"2012-07-04T10:17:23+00:00","author":{"name":"VEGF RSS Feeds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516588600\/VEGF_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"VEGFRSSfeeds","tweeter_id":"88511740","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":363},"tweet_id":"220461295852453891"}]}}
