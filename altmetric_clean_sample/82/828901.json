In contrast, the wide array of species with very well-characterized natural history have, until recently, lacked genomics tools. It is now possible to address significant evolutionary genomics questions by applying high-throughput sequencing to discover the majority of genes for ecologically tractable species, and by subsequently developing microarray platforms from which to investigate gene regulatory networks that function in natural systems. We used GS-FLX Titanium Sequencing (Roche\/454-Sequencing) of two normalized libraries of pooled RNA samples to characterize a transcriptome of the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), a North American sparrow that is a classically studied species in the fields of photoperiodism, speciation, and hormone-mediated behavior.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Mark P Peterson","Mark P Peterson","Danielle J Whittaker","Shruthi Ambreth","Suhas Sureshchandra","Aaron Buechlein","Ram Podicheti","Jeong-Hyeon Choi","Zhao Lai","Keithanne Mockatis","John Colbourne","Haixu Tang","Ellen D Ketterson"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-13-305","first_seen_on":"2012-07-09T12:20:37+00:00","issns":["","1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1341836401,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/13\/305\/abstract"],"pmid":"22776250","pubdate":"2012-07-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"305","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"De novo transcriptome sequencing in a songbird, the dark-eyed junco ( Junco hyemalis ): genomic tools for an ecological model system","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novo-transcriptome-sequencing-songbird-darkeyed-junco-junco-hyemalis-genomic-tools-ecological-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":2939019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1425629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75494,"mean":5.0932808074921,"rank":45749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":26905,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75494,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4113,"mean":3.3469435797665,"rank":2855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4113,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":3.8377986577181,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Ph.
