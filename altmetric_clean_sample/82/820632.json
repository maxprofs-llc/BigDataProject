Treatment arms were balanced for most clinical and molecular characteristics. Median progression-free survival (PFS; primary end point) was 2.86 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.91; two-sided P = .012); in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors, median PFS was 3.71 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.91 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.85; two-sided P = .006); and in patients with KRAS wild-type\/EGFR wild-type tumors, median PFS was 2.21 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 1.84 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.99; two-sided P = .043). Median overall survival was 9.53 months for patients treated with dacomitinib and 7.44 months for patients treated with erlotinib (HR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.13; two-sided P = .205). Adverse event-related discontinuations were uncommon in both arms. Common treatment-related adverse events were dermatologic and gastrointestinal, predominantly grade 1 to 2, and more frequent with dacomitinib.\nDacomitinib demonstrated significantly improved PFS versus erlotinib, with acceptable toxicity. PFS benefit was observed in most clinical and molecular subsets, notably KRAS wild-type\/EGFR any status, KRAS wild-type\/EGFR wild-type, and EGFR mutants.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a18","authors":["Michael Boyer","Ramalingam, Suresh S","Blackhall, Fiona","Krzakowski, Maciej","Barrios, Carlos H","Park, Keunchil","Bover, Isabel","Seog Heo, Dae","Rosell, Rafael","Talbot, Denis C","Frank, Richard","Letrent, Stephen P","Ruiz-Garcia, Ana","Taylor, Ian","Liang, Jane Q","Campbell, Alicyn K","O'Connell, Joseph","Boyer, Michael","Suresh S.
