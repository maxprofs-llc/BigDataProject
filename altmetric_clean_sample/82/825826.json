The discovery of botulinum toxins and development into a useful drug is unique and fascinating, dating back to the early 19th century, when Justinus Kerner first recognized that botulism was caused by a biological toxin and suggested its use for medicinal purposes. This was translated into reality in 1980, when Alan Scott for the first time used the toxins to successfully treat strabismus. Now a subset of botulinum toxins are widely used for cosmetic applications, treatment of various movement disorders, pain and many other syndromes, and further developments using other botulinum toxins or recombinant molecules engineered from subdomains are promising.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a5","authors":["Pellett S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mib.2012.05.005","first_seen_on":"2012-07-06T14:46:19+00:00","issns":["1369-5274","13695274"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1341741658,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1369527412000598"],"pmid":"22651975","pubdate":"2012-06-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Learning from the past: historical aspects of bacterial toxins as pharmaceuticals ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/learning-past-historical-aspects-bacterial-toxins-pharmaceuticals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1622770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2869759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75477,"mean":5.0523941385341,"rank":20879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":54317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75477,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":575,"mean":3.8926236933798,"rank":287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":575,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":4.4037272727273,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
