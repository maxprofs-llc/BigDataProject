Despite this, the mechanisms by which these pathways synergize to prevent rejection are not completely understood. Utilizing a BALB\/c (H2-K(d)) to B6 (H2-K(b)) fully allogeneic skin transplant model system, we performed a detailed longitudinal analysis of the kinetics and magnitude of CD8(+) T cell expansion and differentiation in the presence of CD154\/CD40 pathway blockade. Results demonstrated that treatment with anti-CD154 vs. DST had distinct and opposing effects on activated CD44(high) CD62L(low) CD8(+) T cells in skin graft recipients. Specifically, CD154 blockade delayed alloreactive CD8(+) T cell responses, while DST accelerated them. DST inhibited the differentiation of alloreactive CD8(+) T cells into multi-cytokine producing effectors, while CD40\/CD154 blockade led to the diminution of the KLRG-1(low) long-lived memory precursor population compared with either untreated or DST treated animals. Moreover, only CD154 blockade effectively inhibited CXCL1 expression and neutrophil recruitment into the graft. When combined, anti-CD154 and DST acted synergistically to profoundly diminish the absolute number of IFN-\u03b3 producing alloreactive CD8(+) T cells, and intra-graft expression of inflammatory chemokines. These findings demonstrate that the previously described ability of anti-CD154 and DST to result in alloreactive T cell deletion involves both delayed kinetics of T cell expansion and differentiation and inhibited development of KLRG-1(low) memory precursor cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Ivana R.
