The highly efficient total synthesis of natural (E)-isomer (E)-1 and its artificial (Z)-isomer (Z)-1 by employing a full solid-phase strategy is reported. The (E)- and (Z)-2-amino-2-butenamide moieties were stereoselectively constructed by applying traceless Staudinger ligation on the resin. Interestingly, (E)- and (Z)-1 showed comparable antimicrobial activity (MIC = 4 \u03bcg\/mL).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Yamashita, Tomoya","Kuranaga, Takefumi","Inoue, Masayuki"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.orglett.5b00769","first_seen_on":"2015-10-03T10:23:21+00:00","issns":["1523-7052"],"journal":"Organic Letters","last_mentioned_on":1443867785,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25866994?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25866994","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Solid-Phase Total Synthesis of Bogorol A: Stereocontrolled Construction of Thermodynamically Unfavored (E)-2-Amino-2-butenamide.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/solidphase-total-synthesis-bogorol-stereocontrolled-construction-thermodynamically-unfavored-e2amino"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6422619,"mean":5.8865586600353,"rank":5470684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6422619,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203552,"mean":9.9518884702114,"rank":162297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203552,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3435,"mean":3.3800663948748,"rank":3208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3435,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122,"mean":2.6776694214876,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":7,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AntibioticResis\/statuses\/650254737296588800","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4582496],"posted_on":"2015-10-03T10:23:05+00:00","author":{"name":"AntibioticResistance","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/551766191962746880\/GlO2QteM_normal.jpeg","description":"Keep abreast of the latest developments in the fight against Antibiotic Resistance #AMR with the latest publications curated from PubMed.
