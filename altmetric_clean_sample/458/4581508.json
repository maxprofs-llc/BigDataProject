Horm Metab Res. 2015"],"citation":{"abstract":"Recent experimental data suggest that circulating serotonin interacts with bone metabolism, although this is less clear in humans. This study investigated whether serum serotonin interferes with bone metabolism in young women with anorexia nervosa (AN), a clinical model of energy deprivation. Serum serotonin, markers of bone turnover [osteocalcin (OC), procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP), type I-C telopeptide breakdown products (CTX)], leptin, soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its binding protein (IGFBP-3) were assessed. Whole body, spine, hip, and radius areal bone mineral density BMD (aBMD) were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 21 patients with AN and 19 age-matched controls. Serum serotonin, leptin, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, OC, PINP, and aBMD at all sites, radius excepted, were significantly reduced in AN whereas CTX and sOB-R were increased compared with controls. Serum serotonin levels were positively correlated with weight, body mass index, whole body fat mass, leptin, and IGF-1, and negatively with CTX for the entire population. Low serum serotonin levels are observed in patients with AN. Although no direct link between low serum serotonin levels and bone mass was identified in these patients, the negative relationship between serotonin and markers of bone resorption found in all population nevertheless suggests the implication of serotonin in bone metabolism. Impact of low serum serotonin on bone in AN warrants further studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029fb","authors":["Ma\u00efmoun, L","Guillaume, S","Lefebvre, P","Philibert, P","Bertet, H","Picot, M-C","Courtet, P","Mariano-Goulart, D","Renard, E","Sultan, C"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0035-1559632","first_seen_on":"2015-10-02T23:40:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1439-4286"],"journal":"Hormone & Metabolic Research","last_mentioned_on":1443829204,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26418163"],"pmid":"26418163","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Is Serum Serotonin Involved in the Bone Loss of Young Females with Anorexia Nervosa?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serum-serotonin-involved-bone-loss-young-females-anorexia-nervosa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6420515,"mean":5.8843321179586,"rank":5468395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6420515,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201539,"mean":10.036151733172,"rank":160615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201539,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":310,"mean":3.1593721682848,"rank":229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":310,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.8214285714286,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
