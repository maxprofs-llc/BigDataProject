Abnormal immune response serves a central role in the initiation, progression and exacerbation of inflammatory lung diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\/acute lung injury (ALI). Dysregulation of ncRNAs has been linked to various immunopathologies. In this review, we highlighted the role of ncRNAs in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity, as well as summarized recent findings that ncRNAs participate in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung diseases via their regulation of pulmonary immunity. We also discussed therapeutic potentials for targeting ncRNAs to treat these lung disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002211","authors":["Xie, Na","Liu, Gang"],"doi":"10.1152\/ajplung.00286.2015","first_seen_on":"2015-10-04T10:51:54+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1522-1504"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology: Lung Cellular & Molecular Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1456535107,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26432871?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26432871","pubdate":"2015-10-04T22:00:12+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","physiology","cellbiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"ncRNA regulated immune response and its role in inflammatory lung diseases.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ncrna-regulated-immune-response-role-inflammatory-lung-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7295661,"mean":6.3692208345751,"rank":3185061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4038892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7295661,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235648,"mean":9.282070503762,"rank":94338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":136916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235648,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":776,"mean":2.9828206451613,"rank":203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":776,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":1.4818181818182,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/statuses\/650624174524731392","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4584684],"posted_on":"2015-10-04T10:51:05+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
