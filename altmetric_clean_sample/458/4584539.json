However, it is not known if maintaining NEDA has a positive impact on cognition or brain atrophy.\nTo evaluate NEDA status after two years, addressing its implications on cognition and brain atrophy.\nForty-two relapsing-remitting MS patients and 30 controls underwent MRI (3T) and cognitive evaluation (BRB-N). Forty patients performed additional evaluations, after 12 and 24 months. NEDA was defined as the absence of clinical (relapses\/disability progression) and MRI activity (new T2\/gadolinium-enhancing lesions). Repeated measures and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the contribution of NEDA criteria to GM atrophy.\nAfter two years, 30.8% of the cohort had NEDA. From these, 58.3% still had worsening in \u2a7e2 cognitive domains. Patients with MRI activity had more cortical thinning and slightly more thalamus volume decrease. Absence of new\/enlarging T2 lesions was the only predictor of cortical thinning, subcortical GM and thalamic atrophy rates.\nNEDA status was achieved in a small proportion of our cohort, and did not preclude cognitive deterioration. Absence of MRI activity and especially of new\/enlarging T2 lesions was associated with less cortical and subcortical GM atrophy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000312e","authors":["Damasceno, Alfredo","Damasceno, Benito Pereira","Cendes, Fernando","Alfredo Damasceno","Benito Pereira Damasceno","Fernando Cendes"],"doi":"10.1177\/1352458515604383","endpage":"72","first_seen_on":"2015-10-04T10:17:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-0970"],"issue":"1","journal":"Multiple Sclerosis (13524585)","last_mentioned_on":1489626080,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26432855?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26432855","http:\/\/msj.sagepub.com\/content\/22\/1\/64.abstract?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/msj.sagepub.com\/content\/22\/1\/64.full.pdf","pmid":"26432855","pubdate":"2015-10-04T22:00:12+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"64","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"No evidence of disease activity in multiple sclerosis: Implications on cognition and brain atrophy","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidence-disease-activity-multiple-sclerosis-implications-cognition-brain-atrophy-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.304,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.304},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":764331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7601723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242017,"mean":9.5435456333465,"rank":30367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":211649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242017,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1878,"mean":6.3322354821524,"rank":249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":1626,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1878,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":8.9233793103448,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
