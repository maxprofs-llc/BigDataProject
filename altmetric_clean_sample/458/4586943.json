The overexpression system for miR-208a of cardiomyocytes of neonatal rats was built. The flow cytometry assay was employed to detect the incidence of apoptosis in the over-expressed miR-208a. The mitochondrial staining technique was used to detect the change in the mitochondrial morphology of over-expressed miR-208a. The bioinformatic analysis was chosen to analyze and predict the target gene of miR-208a.\nFirstly, the primary culture system of cardiomyocytes of neonatal rats was successfully built. The miR-208a was over-expressed in cardiomyocytes of neonatal rats by miR-208a Mimics. Results of flow cytometry assay showed that the over-expressed miR-208a could significantly reduce the incidence of apoptosis; while results of mitochondrial staining indicated the change in the mitochondrial morphology of over-expressed miR-208a and the mitochondrial fission process was inhibited. In conclusion, it was supposed that miR-208a could inhibit the activation of mitochondrial fission process to keep the cardiomyocytes from apoptosis.\nThe over-expressed miR-208a can reduce the incidence of apoptosis in the cardiomyocytes of neonatal rats, significantly change the mitochondrial morphology and inhibit the mitochondrial fission process.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b6b","authors":["Meng, Ling-Dong","Meng, Ai-Chun","Zhu, Qing","Jia, Ru-Yi","Kong, Qing-Zan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.apjtm.2015.07.023","first_seen_on":"2015-10-05T11:03:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1995-7645"],"issue":"9","journal":"Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1444043914,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26433661?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26433661","pubdate":"2015-10-05T22:00:14+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Effect of microRNA-208a on mitochondrial apoptosis of cardiomyocytes of neonatal rats.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-microrna208a-mitochondrial-apoptosis-cardiomyocytes-neonatal-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6346128,"mean":5.9206781241548,"rank":4689089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":947000,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6346128,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203463,"mean":9.9945314997396,"rank":139824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":41293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203463,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275,"mean":1.2946642335766,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.1236923076923,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
