A unified theory that links almost all of these findings is proposed. Chronic cardiac Chagas' disease represents the result of a close interaction between the host and the parasite, causing different clinical pictures: patients with an efficient immune response may adequately circumvent the parasitic infection and the individual will develop the indeterminate form. Deficient immune response of the host and\/or a high initial parasitemia favor an immune imbalance that might lead to development of a permanent inadequate immunological response against the parasite. The inflammatory response, which is probably recurrent, undergoing periods of more accentuated exacerbation, is most likely responsible for progressive neuronal damage, microcirculatory alterations, heart matrix deformations and consequent organ failure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024b0","authors":["Maria de Lourdes Higuchi","Luiz Alberto Benvenuti","Marcia Martins Reis","Martin Metzger"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0008-6363(03)00361-4","first_seen_on":"2015-10-03T21:53:05+00:00","issns":["0008-6363","1755-3245"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cardiovascular Research","last_mentioned_on":1443909155,"links":["http:\/\/m.cardiovascres.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/60\/1\/96"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cardiovascres.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/cardiovascres\/60\/1\/96.full.pdf","pmid":"14522411","pubdate":"2003-10-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Pathophysiology of the heart in Chagas\u2019 disease: current status and new developments","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pathophysiology-heart-chagas-disease-current-status-new-developments-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6427836,"mean":5.8881348108638,"rank":5476247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6427836,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203628,"mean":9.9502373555569,"rank":162359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203628,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":894,"mean":2.1260134378499,"rank":729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":894,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":0.88035714285714,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
