We analyzed age-dependent manifestation rates using Poisson regression. We compared the women's rates in intervals where they had been pregnant with their age-matched nonpregnant intervals. We investigated possible long-term effects using pregnancy intervals of increasing lengths of 1, 3, and 5 years after conception. Furthermore, we compared age-related manifestation rates for women and men.\nFrom birth to the participants' current age, 581 manifestations were diagnosed; mean age was 37.5 years (range 2-64 years). Seventeen women had completed 30 pregnancies. Manifestation rates in women's pregnant intervals were lower compared with their age-matched nonpregnant intervals (1 year: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.439, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.131-1.474, p = 0.18; 3 years: HR = 0.412, 95% CI 0.214-0.796, p = 0.0083; and 5 years: HR = 0.450, 95% CI 0.136-1.489, p = 0.19). Men and women had similar manifestation rates, both increasing from their 20s.\nPregnancy does not aggravate vHL tumor development, and we neither discourage pregnancy in VHL mutation carriers nor recommend intensified surveillance during pregnancy. The pregnancy effect is not due to concurrence of a naturally milder tumor development in women's fertile ages, as the rate of new tumor development increases for both men and women from 20 years of age, even more in men than in women.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b59","authors":["Marie Louise M\u00f8lgaard Binderup","Esben Budtz-J\u00f8rgensen","Marie Luise Bisgaard"],"doi":"10.1212\/wnl.0000000000002064","first_seen_on":"2015-10-02T21:02:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-632X"],"journal":"Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1454467510,"links":["http:\/\/www.neurology.org\/content\/early\/2015\/09\/25\/WNL.0000000000002064.abstract","http:\/\/neurology.org\/lookup\/doi\/10.1212\/WNL.0000000000002064","http:\/\/www.neurology.org\/content\/85\/17\/1500.abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26408493?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.neurology.org\/content\/early\/2015\/09\/25\/WNL.0000000000002064.full.pdf","pmid":"26408493","pubdate":"2015-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"New von Hippel-Lindau manifestations develop at the same or decreased rates in pregnancy.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-von-hippellindau-manifestations-develop-same-decreased-rates-pregnancy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8445925,"mean":7.1011257148337,"rank":1822699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6609838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8445925,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240447,"mean":9.6033051412791,"rank":59232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":180749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240447,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9994,"mean":13.899505053537,"rank":3780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":6172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9994,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240,"mean":22.205690376569,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":4,"SA":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeurologyToday\/statuses\/650053206286929920","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4581278],"posted_on":"2015-10-02T21:02:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Neurology Today","url":"http:\/\/www.neurotodayonline.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/474220858295078914\/vUs3O0B__normal.png","description":"The official news source of the American Academy of Neurology, published by Wolters Kluwer.","id_on_source":"NeurologyToday","tweeter_id":"21938868","geo":{"lt":44.97997,"ln":-93.26384,"country":"US"},"followers":31353},"tweet_id":"650053206286929920"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/davidevanstx\/statuses\/650056179037569024","license":"gnip","rt":["NeurologyToday"],"citation_ids":[4581278],"posted_on":"2015-10-02T21:14:05+00:00","author":{"name":"David Evans","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/854078495768461312\/-ZnB1SCe_normal.jpg","description":"Healthcare Executive in Neurosciences.
