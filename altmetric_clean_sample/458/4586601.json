This study aims to explore parental beliefs concerning involvement, facilitators\/barriers and benefits of PA in young people.\nSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 parents of young people with Down syndrome.\nThree facilitation themes were identified: (i) the support derived from family; (ii) the availability of APA (Adapted Physical Activity) expert instructors and coaches; (iii) the challenging nature of sport activities. Three barrier themes were identified: (i) the lack of APA expert coaches and specialized gyms; (ii) the characteristics of Down syndrome; and (iii) the parental beliefs and worries.\nFamily plays a key role, as facilitator and barrier, to the participation of their children with Down syndrome in PA. Crucial is the implementation of evidence-based exercise programmes involving people with Down syndrome and their families.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002c9c","authors":["Alesi, Marianna","Pepi, Annamaria"],"doi":"10.1111\/jar.12220","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2015-10-05T09:40:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1468-3148"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities","last_mentioned_on":1481737453,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/jar.12220","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26434558","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jar.12220\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jar.12220\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jar.12220\/pdf","pmid":"26434558","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Physical Activity Engagement in Young People with Down Syndrome: Investigating Parental Beliefs","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physical-activity-engagement-young-people-down-syndrome-investigating-parental-beliefs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7885400,"mean":6.6781117138083,"rank":1548271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6330458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7885400,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239316,"mean":9.3817831728057,"rank":54849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":184176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239316,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":424,"mean":4.2699574468085,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":424,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":3.9857142857143,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
