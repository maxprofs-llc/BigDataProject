Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, exerts prolongevity effects in evolutionarily diverse species. However, its impact on the intestinal homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that rapamycin can slow down the proliferation rate of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in the aging guts and induce autophagy in the intestinal epithelium in Drosophila. Rapamycin can also significantly affect the FOXO associated genes in intestine and up-regulate the negative regulators of IMD\/Rel pathway, consequently delaying the microbial expansion in the aging guts. Collectively, these findings reveal that rapamycin can delay the intestinal aging by inhibiting mTOR and thus keeping stem cell proliferation in check. These results will further explain the mechanism of healthspan and lifespan extension by rapamycin in Drosophila.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Fan, Xiaolan","Liang, Qing","Lian, Ting","Wu, Qi","Gaur, Uma","Li, Diyan","Yang, Deying","Mao, Xueping","Jin, Zhihua","Li, Ying","Yang, Mingyao"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.5895","first_seen_on":"2015-10-03T10:09:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"34","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1443869649,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26431326?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4742104","pmid":"26431326","pubdate":"2015-10-03T22:00:09+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Rapamycin preserves gut homeostasis during Drosophila aging.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rapamycin-preserves-gut-homeostasis-during-drosophila-aging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6422619,"mean":5.8865586600353,"rank":4745215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":951677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6422619,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203551,"mean":9.951938590027,"rank":139933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":41255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203551,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5823,"mean":1.813504294057,"rank":2584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":2300,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5823,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":923,"mean":1.3320281995662,"rank":454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":923,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
