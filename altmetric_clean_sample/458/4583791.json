The participants were assessed twice, with a 1-year interval. Word associations were coded as paradigmatic, syntagmatic, phonological, other and no answer. This study reports analyses of the semantically-related syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations. Using repeated measures ANOVA, main and interaction effects of Group, Time and Language were examined for paradigmatic and syntagmatic associations separately.\nThe interaction between Group and Time was significant for both associations. The BLI group increased syntagmatic associations from time 1 to time 2, while the BTD group increased paradigmatic associations. Results showed a significant main effect of Language for both types of associations, with better performance in Swedish. Significant Group by Language interactions resulted from lower Arabic than Swedish syntagmatic and paradigmatic scores for the BLI and BTD groups, respectively.\nDiffering developmental trajectories indicate that bilingual children with LI develop lexical organisation at a slower pace than bilingual peers with typical language development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100059b6","authors":["Ketty Holmstr\u00f6m"],"doi":"10.3109\/17549507.2015.1060524","first_seen_on":"2015-10-03T22:30:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1754-9515"],"issue":"2","journal":"International Journal of Speech-Language Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1438090063,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/17549507.2015.1060524"],"pmid":"27172852","pubdate":"2016-05-14T22:03:28+00:00","subjects":["speechlanguagepathology"],"title":"A descriptive study of lexical organisation in bilingual children with language impairment: Developmental changes","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/descriptive-study-lexical-organisation-bilingual-children-language-impairment-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5422157,"mean":6.3120406882422,"rank":4511160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5422157,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196622,"mean":10.013935001856,"rank":156022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196622,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280,"mean":3.5889247311828,"rank":266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":5.6,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
