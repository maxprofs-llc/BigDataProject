However, the function of angiogenic factors in the canine corpus luteum (CL) of pregnancy and in the pregnant uterus and placenta has not yet been elucidated. Therefore, here we investigated the expression and localization of VEGFA and its receptors (VEGFR1\/FLT1 and VEGFR2\/FLK1\/KDR) in the canine CL and utero-placental compartments (ut-pl) throughout pregnancy until prepartum luteolysis. Antigestagen-mediated effects on expression of VEGF system in ut-pl were elucidated in mid-pregnant dogs. While displaying high individual variation, the luteal VEGFA was elevated during pre-implantation and post-implantation, followed by a decrease during mid-gestation, which was more pronounced at the mRNA level, and showed constant expression afterwards. Within the uterus, it increased following implantation and during mid-gestation in ut-pl compartments, but was downregulated at prepartum luteolysis. Luteal VEGFR1 expression resembled that of VEGFA; VEGFR2 remained unaffected throughout pregnancy. In ut-pl compartments, both receptors increased gradually towards mid-gestation; a prepartum decrease was observed for VEGFR1. Antigestagen-treatment resulted in decreased expression of ut-pl VEGFR1. In the CL, VEGFA stained in luteal cells. Uterine signals of VEGFA and its two receptors were observed in epithelial and vascular compartments, and in myometrium. In placental labyrinth, additionally, trophoblast stained positively. Luteal VEGFR1 was localized to the luteal cells and tunica media of blood vessels, whereas VEGFR2 stained only in capillary endothelial cells. The upregulation of luteal and the ut-pl VEGF system during early gestational stages supports the increased vascularization rate during this time. The diminishing effects of the prepartum endocrine milieu on VEGFA function seem to be more pronounced in the ut-pl units.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002936","authors":["Gram, Aykut","Hoffmann, Bernd","Boos, Alois","Kowalewski, Mariusz P"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ygcen.2015.09.020","first_seen_on":"2015-10-05T15:36:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1095-6840","00166480"],"journal":"General & Comparative Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1444059364,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0016648015002646"],"pmid":"26414127","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Expression and localization of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and its two receptors (VEGFR1\/FLT1 and VEGFR2\/FLK1\/KDR) in the canine corpus luteum and utero-placental compartments during pregnancy and at normal and induced parturition ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-localization-vascular-endothelial-growth-factor-vegfa-two-receptors-vegfr1flt1-vegfr2flk1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6349067,"mean":5.9217662156934,"rank":5402049,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6349067,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203455,"mean":9.9941673498679,"rank":162161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203455,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":644,"mean":1.9851135303266,"rank":442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":644,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.8625,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":4,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Albinovet\/statuses\/651058279012040704","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4587798],"posted_on":"2015-10-05T15:36:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefano Cattaneo DVM","url":"http:\/\/veterinarialbino.com\/\/twitter_en.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1673372763\/vet_tweet_normal.png","description":"Daily updates about pet health covering the last articles published in veterinary journals.","id_on_source":"Albinovet","tweeter_id":"418669767","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2113},"tweet_id":"651058279012040704"}]}}
