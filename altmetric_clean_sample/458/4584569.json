In this study, we offer evidence for a generalized strategy to blunt Treg activity that can limit immune escape and promote tumor rejection. Activation of innate immunity with Toll-like receptor (TLR) or RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) ligands prevented accumulation of Treg in tumors by blocking their immigration. Mechanistic investigations indicated Treg blockade was a consequence of reduced intratumoral CCL22 levels caused by type I interferon. Notably, stable expression of CCL22 abrogated the antitumor effects of treatment with RLR or TLR ligands. Taken together, our findings argue that type I interferon blocks the Treg-attracting chemokine CCL22 and thus helps limit the recruitment of Treg to tumors, a finding with implications for cancer immunotherapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["Anz, David","Rapp, Moritz","Eiber, Stephan","Koelzer, Viktor H","Thaler, Raffael","Haubner, Sascha","Knott, Max","Nagel, Sarah","Golic, Michaela","Wiedemann, Gabriela M","Bauernfeind, Franz","Wurzenberger, Cornelia","Hornung Prof, Veit","Scholz, Christoph","Mayr, Doris","Rothenfusser, Simon","Endres, Stefan","Bourquin, Carole"],"doi":"10.1158\/0008-5472.can-14-3499","first_seen_on":"2015-10-04T10:23:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1538-7445"],"journal":"Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1456519988,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26432403?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/75\/21\/4483.short?rss=1","http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/10\/02\/0008-5472.CAN-14-3499.long"],"pmid":"26432403","pubdate":"2015-10-04T22:00:22+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Suppression of intratumoral CCL22 by type I interferon inhibits migration of regulatory T cells and blocks cancer progression.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/suppression-intratumoral-ccl22-type-i-interferon-inhibits-migration-regulatory-t-cells-blocks-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7289383,"mean":6.3680766857843,"rank":1382859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5900565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7289383,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235639,"mean":9.2799512387645,"rank":53406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":181967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235639,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6783,"mean":6.6702692421115,"rank":1276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6783,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":7.1987352941176,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
