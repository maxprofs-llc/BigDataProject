Identification of risk factors for central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) in patients with PTC could assist surgeons in determining whether to perform selective pCLND.\nThe National Cancer database was queried from 1998 to 2011 for patients with clinical staging T1-4cN0M0 PTC. All patients underwent near, sub-, or total thyroidectomy with or without pCLND. Univariate and multivariable logistic regressions were performed on the following clinical variables: age, sex, race and tumor size as risk factors for pathologic CLNM (pN1a).\nIn 39,562 patients with T1-4cN0M0 PTC, 61% underwent pCLND. Patients with age >45\u00a0years, African American race, tumor size \u22641\u00a0cm, unifocal tumors, follicular variant PTC, no insurance, and treatment at community cancer facilities were less likely to have pCLND (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). In the pCLND group, 15.6% of patients had CLNM. On adjusted multivariable logistic regression, age \u226445\u00a0years, Asian race, male sex, and larger tumors were statistically significantly associated with CLNM.\nAge \u226445\u00a0years, Asian race, male sex, and larger tumors are associated with the presence of CLNM, which allows for selective pCLND in PTC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008a97","authors":["Suman, Paritosh","Wang, Chi-Hsiung","Abadin, ShabirHusain S","Moo-Young, Tricia A","Prinz, Richard A","Winchester, David J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.surg.2015.08.032","first_seen_on":"2015-10-02T22:42:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0039-6060","1532-7361"],"journal":"Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1444127730,"links":["http:\/\/www.surgjournal.com\/article\/S0039-6060(15)00700-X\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26435436?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.surgjournal.com\/article\/S003960601500700X\/pdf","pmid":"26435436","pubdate":"2015-10-06T10:18:05+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Risk factors for central lymph node metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinoma: A National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-factors-central-lymph-node-metastasis-papillary-thyroid-carcinoma-national-cancer-data-base-ncd"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6290900,"mean":5.9493822682593,"rank":2718125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3520274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6290900,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194788,"mean":10.224904865314,"rank":92816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":100004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194788,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1856,"mean":2.72954393531,"rank":671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1856,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155,"mean":1.9271428571429,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UnivSurg\/statuses\/650078319958970374","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4581454],"posted_on":"2015-10-02T22:42:04+00:00","author":{"name":"University Surgeons","url":"http:\/\/www.susweb.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/499280422446985217\/2g9MERTh_normal.png","description":"Supporting and advancing leaders in academic surgery\n\nDRIVEN TO LEAD","id_on_source":"UnivSurg","tweeter_id":"2727044768","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2490},"tweet_id":"650078319958970374"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/651340388020584451","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4581454],"posted_on":"2015-10-06T10:17:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":441},"tweet_id":"651340388020584451"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/adonistupac\/statuses\/651345026874785792","license":"gnip","rt":["cirugiaF"],"citation_ids":[4581454],"posted_on":"2015-10-06T10:35:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Adonis Ramirez","url":"http:\/\/www.adonistupacmd.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/873008338367328258\/yFXon2l7_normal.jpg","description":"Cirujano de cabeza y cuello, Superunner, IM aficionado, poeta y so\u00f1ador.
