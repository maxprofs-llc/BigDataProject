Sixteen polysaccharides obtained were examined for antitumor effects on Sarcoma 180 in mice. The three active polysaccharides obtained were as follows: FIo-a: A glycan-protein complex containing 9.3% protein, and having a hetero-glyco-chain of mannose and xylose. FIo-b-alpha: Molecular weight 10,000, glucan-protein complex containing 25.8% protein. The inhibition ratio was 61.8% against the solid cancer Sarcoma 180\/mice; the survival ratio was more than 194% of the control group (100). FA-1-b-alpha: Molecular weight 16,000, a complex of glycan:protein = 42:58 w\/w, consisting of glucose as a main component, and associated with arabinose, mannose, xylose, and galactose. This had a tumor inhibition ratio of 56% and a survival ratio of more than 182%. Comparison of active glycan with the fruiting body and mycelium: Among water-soluble polysaccharides of fruiting body, FIo-a and FA-1, with antitumor activity, were both glucogalactan-protein complexes of molecular weight 10,000, but that of mycelium was a homoglucan protein complex in FIo-b-alpha and heteroglucan protein in both FA-1-a and FA-1-b-alpha. The heteroglucan had a low tumor inhibition ratio, but caused a high survival ratio in mice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c94","authors":["Zhang, J","Wang, G","Li, H","Zhuang, C","Mizuno, T","Ito, H","Mayuzumi, H","Okamoto, H","Li, J"],"first_seen_on":"2016-03-23T10:12:45+00:00","issns":["0916-8451"],"issue":"7","journal":"Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1458904803,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7765245"],"pmid":"7765245","pubdate":"1994-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"Antitumor active protein-containing glycans from the Chinese mushroom songshan lingzhi, Ganoderma tsugae mycelium.","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antitumor-active-proteincontaining-glycans-chinese-mushroom-songshan-lingzhi-ganoderma-tsugae-myceli"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7438587,"mean":6.4662340552314,"rank":607525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":6829917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7438587,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275937,"mean":10.990761263481,"rank":34079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":241791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275937,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":955,"mean":3.1022243186583,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":955,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":1.1059523809524,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":13,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":13,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
