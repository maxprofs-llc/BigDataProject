We previously found ATZ attenuated oxidative liver injury, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose frequently induces life-threatening oxidative hepatitis. In the present study, the potential hepatoprotective effects of ATZ on oxidative liver injury and the underlying mechanisms were further investigated in a mouse model with APAP poisoning. The experimental data indicated that pretreatment with ATZ dose- and time-dependently suppressed the elevation of plasma aminotransferases in APAP exposed mice, these effects were accompanied with alleviated histological abnormality and improved survival rate of APAP-challenged mice. In mice exposed to APAP, ATZ pretreatment decreased the CAT activities, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels, malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels in liver and reduced TNF-\u03b1 levels in plasma. Pretreatment with ATZ also downregulated APAP-induced cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) expression and JNK phosphorylation. In addition, posttreatment with ATZ after APAP challenge decreased the levels of plasma aminotransferases and increased the survival rate of experimental animals. Posttreatment with ATZ had no effects on CYP2E1 expression or JNK phosphorylation, but it significantly decreased the levels of plasma TNF-\u03b1. Our data indicated that the LD50 of ATZ in mice was 5367.4 mg\/kg body weight, which is much higher than the therapeutic dose of ATZ in the present study. These data suggested that ATZ might be effective and safe in protect mice against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity, the beneficial effects might resulted from downregulation of CYP2E1 and inhibiton of inflammation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yuping Jing","Kunwei Wu","Jiashuo Liu","Qing Ai","Pu Ge","Jie Dai","Rong Jiang","Dan Zhou","Qian Che","Jingyuan Wan","Li Zhang"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0122781","first_seen_on":"2017-04-30T03:35:22+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1496547146,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0122781"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0122781&type=printable","pmid":"25884831","pubdate":"2015-04-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Aminotriazole Alleviates Acetaminophen Poisoning via Downregulating P450 2E1 and Suppressing Inflammation","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aminotriazole-alleviates-acetaminophen-poisoning-via-downregulating-p450-2e1-suppressing-inflammatio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":7191480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245024,"mean":12.665605808434,"rank":199275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245024,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115028,"mean":10.607384144592,"rank":97006,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115028,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4293,"mean":10.270095060578,"rank":3521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4293,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
