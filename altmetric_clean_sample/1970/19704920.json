This longitudinal study examined the processes by which Mexican-origin adolescent mothers' coparenting conflict with their 3-year-old children's grandmothers and biological fathers (N\u00a0=\u00a0133 families) were linked to children's academic and social skills at 5\u00a0years of age, and whether children's effortful control at 4\u00a0years of age mediated the link between coparenting conflict and indices of children's academic readiness. Findings revealed that adolescent mothers' coparenting conflict with their child's biological father was linked to indices of children's academic and social school readiness through children's effortful control among girls, but not boys, whereas conflict with grandmothers was directly linked to boys' and girls' social functioning 2\u00a0years later. Findings offer information about different mechanisms by which multiple coparenting units in families of adolescent mothers are related to their children's outcomes, and this work has important implications for practitioners working with families of adolescent mothers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028ad","authors":["Jahromi, Laudan B.","Zeiders, Katharine H.","Updegraff, Kimberly A.","Uma\u00f1a\u2010Taylor, Adriana J.","Bayless, Sara Douglass"],"doi":"10.1111\/famp.12290","first_seen_on":"2017-04-29T20:34:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00147370","1545-5300"],"journal":"Family Process","last_mentioned_on":1496212020,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/famp.12290\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/famp.12290\/abstract?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/famp.12290\/abstract;jsessionid=16BD2536F4D76CA0EFFB63F30A371644.f04t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/famp.12290\/pdf","pmid":"28436587","pubdate":"2017-04-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["socialsciences","primaryhealthcare","psychology"],"title":"Coparenting Conflict and Academic Readiness in Children of Teen Mothers: Effortful Control as a Mediator","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.58,"score_history":{"1y":8.58,"6m":8.58,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.58},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8431275,"mean":7.091115454667,"rank":1059934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7369466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8431275,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248373,"mean":12.774805557792,"rank":46046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":202211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248373,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":472,"mean":5.9690955414013,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":472,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":5.955,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/joseluissariego\/statuses\/858419162577866752","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19704920],"posted_on":"2017-04-29T20:34:11+00:00","author":{"name":"jose luis sariego","url":"http:\/\/gestionconflictosfamilia.blogspot.com.es\/?m=1","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/475368079359479808\/gc02z2V5_normal.jpeg","description":"Abogado de familias, mediador, gesti\u00f3n pac\u00edfica y colaborativa de conflictos de familias.
