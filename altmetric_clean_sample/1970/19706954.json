Although previous investigations have demonstrated the importance of the TMD of Ostb for its activity, further studies were conducted to assess the contributions of other regions of the Ostb subunit. Transport activity was retained when Ostb was truncated to contain only the TMD with 15 additional residues on each side and co-expressed with Osta, whereas shorter fragments were inactive. To probe the broader functions of Ostb segments, chimeric proteins were constructed in which N-terminal, TMD or C-terminal regions of Ostb were fused to corresponding regions of receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP1), a single TMD protein required by several seven TMD G protein-coupled receptors including the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR). Ostb\/RAMP1 chimeras were expressed with Osta and CLR. As expected, replacing the Ostb TMD abolished transport activity; however, replacing either the entire N-terminal or entire C-terminal domain of Ostb with RAMP1 sequences did not prevent plasma membrane localization or ability to support [(3)H]taurocholate uptake. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the C-terminus of Ostb is a previously unrecognized site of interaction with Osta. All chimeras containing N-terminal RAMP1 segments allowed co-expressed CLR to respond to agonists with strong increases in cyclic AMP. These results provide new insights into the structure and function of the heteromeric Ost transporter complex.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c1","authors":["Whitney V Christian","Patricia M.
