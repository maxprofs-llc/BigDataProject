This paper describes a unit costing estimation system developed in England (cost calculator) together with a pilot test of its utility in the United States where unit costs are routinely available for health services but not for child welfare services. The cost calculator approach uses a unified conceptual model that focuses on eight core child welfare processes. Comparison of these core processes in England and in four counties in the United States suggests that the underlying child welfare processes generated from England were perceived as very similar by child welfare staff in California county systems with some exceptions in the review and legal processes. Overall, the adaptation of the cost calculator for use in the United States child welfare systems appears promising. The paper also compares the cost calculator approach to the workload approach widely used in the United States and concludes that there are distinct differences between the two approaches with some possible advantages to the use of the cost calculator approach, especially in the use of this method for estimating child welfare costs in relation to the incorporation of evidence-based interventions into routine practice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000250d","authors":["Lisa Holmes","John Landsverk","Harriet Ward","Jennifer Rolls-Reutz","Lisa Saldana","Fred Wulczyn","Patricia Chamberlain","Holmes, Lisa","Landsverk, John","Ward, Harriet","Rolls-Reutz, Jennifer","Saldana, Lisa","Wulczyn, Fred","Chamberlain, Patricia"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.childyouth.2013.10.003","endpage":"176","first_seen_on":"2016-02-22T19:02:32+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["01907409","0190-7409"],"journal":"Children & Youth Services Review","last_mentioned_on":1451606400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.childyouth.2013.10.003"],"pmcid":"PMC4580336","pmid":"26412917","pubdate":"2014-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"169","title":"Cost calculator methods for estimating casework time in child welfare services: A promising approach for use in implementation of evidence-based practices and other service innovations","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0190740913003058","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cost-calculator-methods-estimating-casework-time-child-welfare-services-promising-approach-implement"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8096639,"mean":6.890087373789,"rank":2035991,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4955659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8096639,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289617,"mean":10.705324629854,"rank":91207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":191997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289617,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":867,"mean":5.40792147806,"rank":255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":867,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":10.26675,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
