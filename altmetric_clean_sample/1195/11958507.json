We first present a brief overview of existing works on the effect of channel correlations on the system performance. We then focus on our main contribution which is analyzing the outage probability of a multi-AnF-relay system with the best relay selection (BRS) scheme under a condition that two channels of each relay, source-relay and relay-destination channels, are correlated. Using lower and upper bounds on the end-to-end received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination, we derive corresponding upper and lower bounds on the system outage probability. We prove that the system can achieve a diversity order (DO) equal to the number of relays. In addition, and importantly, we show that the considered correlation form has a constructive effect on the system performance. In other words, the larger the correlation coefficient, the better system performance. Our analytic results are corroborated by extensive Monte-Carlo simulations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Binh Van Nguyen"],"doi":"10.3390\/s16091472","first_seen_on":"2016-09-12T10:20:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"9","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1473675613,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/16\/9\/1472"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/16\/9\/1472\/pdf","pmid":"27626426","pubdate":"2016-09-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Performance Analysis of Amplify-and-Forward Systems with Single Relay Selection in Correlated Environments","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/performance-analysis-amplifyandforward-systems-single-relay-selection-correlated-environments"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":6348645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1134084,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252579,"mean":12.460398427416,"rank":178092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42682,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252579,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3453,"mean":1.9826077636153,"rank":1891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3453,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194,"mean":1.3093264248705,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Sensors_MDPI\/statuses\/775277829017575424","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11958507],"posted_on":"2016-09-12T10:20:13+00:00","author":{"name":"@Sensors_MDPI","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/rPrToAqh0i","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/644194401313361920\/_TWXMHk9_normal.jpg","description":"Sensors (ISSN 1424-8220; IF: 2.245) is the leading international, peer-reviewed, open access journal on the science and technology of sensors and biosensors.","id_on_source":"Sensors_MDPI","tweeter_id":"3584565133","followers":136},"tweet_id":"775277829017575424"}]}}
