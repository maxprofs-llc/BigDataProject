However, the passive diffusion-driven cellular uptake of currently available radiotracers results in slow kinetics and low tumor-to-background ratios. With the aim to develop a compound that is actively transported into cells, 1-(6'-deoxy-6'-[(18)F]fluoro-\u03b2-d-allofuranosyl)-2-nitroimidazole (\u03b2-[(18)F]1), a putative nucleoside transporter substrate, was synthetized by nucleophilic [(18)F]fluoride substitution of an acetyl protected labeling precursor with a tosylate leaving group (\u03b2-6) in a final radiochemical yield of 12\u00b18% (n=10, based on [(18)F]fluoride starting activity) in a total synthesis time of 60min with a specific activity at end of synthesis of 218\u00b158GBq\/\u03bcmol (n=10). Both radiolabeling precursor \u03b2-6 and unlabeled reference compound \u03b2-1 were prepared in multistep syntheses starting from 1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-\u03b1-d-allofuranose. In vitro experiments demonstrated an interaction of \u03b2-1 with SLC29A1 and SLC28A1\/2\/3 nucleoside transporter as well as hypoxia specific retention of \u03b2-[(18)F]1 in tumor cell lines. In biodistribution studies in healthy mice \u03b2-[(18)F]1 showed homogenous tissue distribution and excellent metabolic stability, which was unaffected by tissue oxygenation. PET studies in tumor bearing mice showed tumor-to-muscle ratios of 2.13\u00b10.22 (n=4) at 2h after administration of \u03b2-[(18)F]1. In ex vivo autoradiography experiments \u03b2-[(18)F]1 distribution closely matched staining with the hypoxia marker pimonidazole. In conclusion, \u03b2-[(18)F]1 shows potential as PET hypoxia radiotracer which merits further investigation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f1","authors":["Wanek, Thomas","Kreis, Katharina","Kri\u017ekov\u00e1, Petra","Schweifer, Anna","Denk, Christoph","Stanek, Johann","Mairinger, Severin","Filip, Thomas","Sauberer, Michael","Edelhofer, Patricia","Traxl, Alexander","Muchitsch, Viktoria E","Mereiter, Kurt","Hammerschmidt, Friedrich","Cass, Carol E","Damaraju, Vijaya L","Langer, Oliver","Kuntner, Claudia"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmc.2016.08.053","first_seen_on":"2016-09-12T11:14:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1464-3391","09680896"],"journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1473678695,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27614920?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27614920","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Synthesis and preclinical characterization of 1-(6\u0301-deoxy-6\u0301-[18F]fluoro-\u03b2-D-allofuranosyl)-2-nitroimidazole (\u03b2-6\u0301-[18F]FAZAL) as a positron emission tomography radiotracer to assess tumor hypoxia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-preclinical-characterization-16deoxy618ffluorodallofuranosyl2nitroimidazole-618ffazal-posi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":7231992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252579,"mean":12.460356064265,"rank":209882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252579,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1363,"mean":2.3927063142438,"rank":983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1363,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":5.558085106383,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
