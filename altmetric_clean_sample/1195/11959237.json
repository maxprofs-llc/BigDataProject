Three patients had Aicardi syndrome, and one patient had tuberous sclerosis. Associated focal cortical dysplasia was noted in all 14 cases. Patterns of dysplasia observed included International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) type I Ib (n\u2009=\u20097), ILAE type Ib (n\u2009=\u20094), ILAE type Ic (n\u2009=\u20092), and ILAE type IIa (n\u2009=\u20091). Additional pathologic findings included evidence of contusional damage (n\u2009=\u20095), gray matter nodular heterotopias (n\u2009=\u20093), polymicrogygria (n\u2009=\u20092), hemimegalencephaly (n\u2009=\u20092), and hippocampal sclerosis (ILAE type II, CA1 sclerosis) (n\u2009=\u20091). Postoperative follow-up intervals ranged from two to 93 months (mean, 31.2 months). Seven patients were free of seizures or had only rare disabling seizures (Engel I\/II) at most recent follow-up. Two patients had recurrent seizures with no worthwhile improvement (Engel IV) at follow-up.\nThe current series supports an association of Aicardi syndrome (21% of cases) and focal cortical dysplasia (100% of cases) and hyaline protoplasmic astrocytopathy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f4","authors":["Prayson, Richard A"],"doi":"10.1093\/ajcp\/aqw136","first_seen_on":"2016-09-12T11:34:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1943-7722","0002-9173"],"journal":"American Journal of Clinical Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1473684536,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27614668?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27614668?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27614668","pubdate":"2016-09-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"aqw136","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Hyaline Protoplasmic Astrocytopathy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hyaline-protoplasmic-astrocytopathy-clinicopathologic-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":4462342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2328744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252579,"mean":12.460320233749,"rank":139122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":88853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252579,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1380,"mean":4.3719680928209,"rank":883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1380,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":3.8046875,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
