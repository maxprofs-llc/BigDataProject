Here we examined the mechanisms of regulation of MSCs responsiveness to noradrenaline. Using flow cytometry, we demonstrated that \u03b11A adrenergic receptors isoform was the most abundant in adipose tissue-derived MSCs. Using calcium imaging in single cells, we demonstrated that only 6.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8% of MSCs responded to noradrenaline by intracellular calcium release. Noradrenaline increases MSCs sensitivity to catecholamines in a transitory mode. Within 6\u2009hrs after incubation with noradrenaline the proportion of cells responding by Ca(2+) release to the fresh noradrenaline addition has doubled but declined to the baseline after 24\u2009hrs. Increased sensitivity was due to the elevated quantities of \u03b11A-adrenergic receptors on MSCs. Such elevation depended on the stimulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase activation. The data for the first time clarify mechanisms of regulation of MSCs sensitivity to noradrenaline.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Pyotr A. Tyurin-Kuzmin","Julia I.
