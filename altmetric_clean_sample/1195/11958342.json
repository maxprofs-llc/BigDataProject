We describe clinical features and management strategies of cervicofacial nontuberculous mycobacterium lymphadenitis in a tertiary pediatric hospital.\nRetrospective analysis of medical records of children discharged from 1992 to 2014 with a diagnosis of cervicofacial nontuberculous mycobacterium was made. Diagnosis certainty was based on microhistological investigations. Clinical stage was evaluated according to lymph node size and presence of fistulas. Successful therapy was defined by the regression of the lymph node enlargement (>75%) or complete surgical excision without relapse.\nCervicofacial nontuberculous mycobacterium was diagnosed in 33 patients. Complete excision was performed in 73% of cases primarily observed in our hospital, while 83% of those referred from other hospitals required further surgical treatment. No case of relapse was observed after one year of follow-up.\nWe recommend surgical approach as the first therapeutic option in the management of cervicofacial nontuberculous mycobacterium lymphadenitis.\nPrognosis and Retrospective Study - Level II.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dd6","authors":["Naselli, Aldo","Losurdo, Giuseppe","Avanzini, Stefano","Tarantino, Vincenzo","Cristina, Emilio","Bondi, Elisabetta","Castagnola, Elio"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jpedsurg.2016.08.005","first_seen_on":"2016-09-12T10:07:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1531-5037","00223468"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatric Surgery (Science Direct)","last_mentioned_on":1473684961,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27614809?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27614809","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pediatrics"],"title":"Management of non-tuberculous mycobacterial lymphadenitis in a tertiary care children's hospital: a 20year experience","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-lymphadenitis-tertiary-care-childrens-hospital-20year-experi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":4462340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2328745,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252579,"mean":12.460313503155,"rank":139120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":88854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252579,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2057,"mean":2.149439688716,"rank":922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2057,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":2.3973404255319,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NTM_papers\/statuses\/775274680164818944","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11958342],"posted_on":"2016-09-12T10:07:42+00:00","author":{"name":"NTM-Papers","url":"http:\/\/www.ntm-net.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/556077140546834432\/IysSZZGo_normal.jpeg","description":"Publications related to Nontuberculous mycobacteria.","id_on_source":"NTM_papers","tweeter_id":"2981035635","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":76},"tweet_id":"775274680164818944"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/775275586797264896","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11958342],"posted_on":"2016-09-12T10:11:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":441},"tweet_id":"775275586797264896"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/D_Papaventsis\/statuses\/775317039288315904","license":"gnip","rt":["NTM_papers"],"citation_ids":[11958342],"posted_on":"2016-09-12T12:56:01+00:00","author":{"name":"D.
