In the study, 72 Purebred Arabian racehorses were included. The study was implemented during the full race season. The horses from control and experimental groups were included in regular race training 6 days a week. The horses from the experimental group were additionally subject to the relaxing massage 3 days a week during the whole study. HR and HRV were assumed as indicators of the emotional state of the horses. The measurements were taken six times, every 4-5\u2009weeks. The HRV parameters were measured at rest, during grooming and saddling the horse and during warm-up walking under a rider. The changes of the parameters throughout the season suggest that the relaxing massage may be effectively used to make the racehorses more relaxed and calm. Moreover, the horses from the experimental group had better race performance records.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000225f","authors":["Kowalik, Sylwester","Janczarek, Iwona","K\u0119dzierski, Witold","Stachurska, Anna","Wilk, Izabela"],"doi":"10.1111\/asj.12671","endpage":"677","first_seen_on":"2016-09-12T03:11:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1740-0929","13443941"],"issue":"4","journal":"Animal Science Journal","last_mentioned_on":1498139896,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/asj.12671\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/asj.12671","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/asj.12671\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/asj.12671\/pdf","pmid":"27594340","pubdate":"2016-09-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"669","title":"The effect of relaxing massage on heart rate and heart rate variability in purebred Arabian racehorses","type":"article","volume":"88","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-relaxing-massage-heart-rate-heart-rate-variability-purebred-arabian-racehorses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":2.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":3438179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4911470,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252953,"mean":12.49109589171,"rank":94973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":155911,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252953,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261,"mean":1.7709,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.1,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"The effect of relaxing massage on heart rate and heart rate variability in purebred Arabian racehorses - Kowalik - 2016 - Animal Science Journal - Wiley Online Library","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=10154341924052626&id=194549292625","license":"public","citation_ids":[11955029],"posted_on":"2016-09-12T00:01:45+00:00","summary":"Bodyworkers and performance horse owners may be interested in this study -\n\"... relaxing massage may be effectively used to make the racehorses more relaxed and calm.
