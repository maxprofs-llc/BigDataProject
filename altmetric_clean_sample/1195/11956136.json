Seventeen [20.0%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.5-28.5%] patients reported important symptoms up to 3 weeks before index presentation. In the Emergency Department, most patients complained of abdominal and\/or back pain, seven (8.2%, 95% CI 2.4-14.0%) additionally reported atypical pain and ten (11.8%, 95% CI 4.9-18.7%) denied pain altogether. Hypotension (36.5%, 95% CI 26.3-46.7%), tachycardia (18.8%, 95% CI 10.5-27.1%) and syncope (36.5%, 95% CI 26.3-46.7%) were documented in a minority of cases. Distracting symptoms were present in 33 (38.8%, 95% CI 28.4-49.2%) patients. The median time to diagnosis was 17.5\u2009min (range immediate-12 days), and 21 (25.6%, 95% CI 16.3-34.9%) patients were misdiagnosed during clinical assessment.\nThe classical signs and symptoms or rAAA are not always present and patients frequently show additional features that may confound the diagnosis. A high level of suspicion should be adopted for rAAA alongside a low threshold for immediate computed tomography. Further research is required to develop an objective clinical risk score or predictive tool for characterizing patients at risk.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000734a","authors":["Metcalfe, David","Sugand, Kapil","Thrumurthy, Sri G.","Thompson, Matthew M.","Holt, Peter J.","Karthikesalingam, Alan Prasanna","Thrumurthy, Sri G","Thompson, Matthew M","Holt, Peter J"],"doi":"10.1097\/mej.0000000000000281","endpage":"390","first_seen_on":"2016-09-12T06:35:57+00:00","funders":["dohuk"],"issns":["1473-5695","0969-9546"],"issue":"5","journal":"European Journal of Emergency Medicine: Official Journal of the European Society for Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1475591940,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/euro-emergencymed\/Abstract\/2016\/10000\/Diagnosis_of_ruptured_abdominal_aortic_aneurysm__.12.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25969344"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/euro-emergencymed\/2016\/10000\/Diagnosis_of_ruptured_abdominal_aortic_aneurysm__.12.pdf","pmid":"25969344","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"386","subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Diagnosis of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/euro-emergencymed\/Fulltext\/2016\/10000\/Diagnosis_of_ruptured_abdominal_aortic_aneurysm__.12.aspx","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diagnosis-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-multicentre-cohort-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.5,"score_history":{"1y":7.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7476637,"mean":6.4841716895094,"rank":977008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":6494215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7476637,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241367,"mean":12.216996784965,"rank":47821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":193352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241367,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":807,"mean":3.3361836228288,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":807,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.9795652173913,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Librarian":1,"Unspecified":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EJ_EmergencyMed\/statuses\/775221322347536384","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11956136],"posted_on":"2016-09-12T06:35:40+00:00","author":{"name":"EJ_Emergency_Med","url":"http:\/\/www.euro-emergencymed.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1801120310\/European_Journal_of_Emergency_Medicine_square_cover_normal.jpg","description":"Devoted to serving the European emergency medicine community and to promoting European standards of training, diagnosis and care in this rapidly growing field.","id_on_source":"EJ_EmergencyMed","tweeter_id":"482034086","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1377},"tweet_id":"775221322347536384"}],"blogs":[{"title":"Articles of the Month (September 2016)","url":"https:\/\/first10em.com\/2016\/10\/04\/articles-of-the-month-september-2016\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[12448121,12448121,6535922,12422688,12448127,6256566,12448130,5626431,11956136,2552609,12448140],"posted_on":"2016-10-04T14:39:00+00:00","summary":"It&rsquo;s time for another edition of the articles of the month.
