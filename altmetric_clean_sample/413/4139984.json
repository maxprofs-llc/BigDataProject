These patients were divided into two groups: a sedation group (n=28) and a non-sedation group (n=63). The patients were also grouped in two groups: deep sedation group and daily interruption and \/or light sedation group.\nOverall, the 91 patients who had received ventilation \u226548 hours were analyzed. Multivariate analysis demonstrated two independent risk factors for in-hospital death: sequential organ failure assessment score (P=0.019, RR 1.355, 95%CI 1.051-1.747, B=0.304, SE=0.130, Wald=50483) and sedation (P=0.041, RR 5.015, 95%CI 1.072-23.459, B=1.612, SE=0.787, Wald=4.195). Compared with the patients who had received no sedation, those who had received sedation had a longer duration of ventilation, a longer stay in intensive care unit and hospital, and an increased in-hospital mortality rate. The Kaplan-Meier method showed that patients who had received sedation had a lower 60-month survival rate than those who had received no sedation (76.7% vs. 88.9%, Log-rank test=3.630, P=0.057). Compared with the patients who had received deep sedation, those who had received daily interruption or light sedation showed a decreased in-hospital mortality rate (57.1% vs. 9.5%, P=0.008). The 60-month survival of the patients who had received deep sedation was significantly lower than that of those who had daily interruption or light sedation (38.1% vs. 90.5%, Log-rank test=6.783, P=0.009).\nSedation was associated with in-hospital death. The patients who had received sedation had a longer duration of ventilation, a longer stay in intensive care unit and in hospital, and an increased in-hospital mortality rate compared with the patients who did not receive sedation. Compared with daily interruption or light sedation, deep sedation increased the in-hospital mortality and decreased the 60-month survival for patients who had received sedation.","authors":["Xing, Xue-Zhong","Gao, Yong","Wang, Hai-Jun","Qu, Shi-Ning","Huang, Chu-Lin","Zhang, Hao","Wang, Hao","Xiao, Qing-Ling","Sun, Ke-Lin"],"doi":"10.5847\/wjem.j.1920-8642.2015.02.011","first_seen_on":"2015-06-12T10:20:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1920-8642"],"issue":"2","journal":"World journal of emergency medicine","last_mentioned_on":1433931918,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26056547?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26056547","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Effect of sedation on short-term and long-term outcomes of critically ill patients with acute respiratory insufficiency.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-sedation-shortterm-longterm-outcomes-critically-ill-patients-acute-respiratory-insufficiency-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/status\/608580689907191808","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4139984],"posted_on":"2015-06-10T10:25:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
