The complexity of the known signaling pathways involved in PAD, including various growth factor pathways and their crosstalks, suggests that analyses of high-throughput experimental data could lead to a new level of understanding of the disease as well as novel and heretofore unanticipated potential targets. Such bioinformatic analyses have not been systematically performed for PAD. We constructed the global protein-protein interaction networks of angiogenesis (Angiome), immune response (Immunome) and arteriogenesis (Arteriome) using our previously developed algorithm GeneHits. The term \"PADPIN\" refers to the angiome, immunome and arteriome in PAD. Here we analyze four microarray gene expression datasets from ischemic and nonischemic gastrocnemius muscles at day 3 post hindlimb ischemia (HLI) in two genetically different C57BL\/6 and BALB\/c mouse strains that display differential susceptibility to HLI to identify potential targets and signaling pathways in angiogenesis, immune, and arteriogenesis networks. We hypothesize that identification of the differentially expressed genes in ischemic and nonischemic muscles between the strains that recovers better (C57BL\/6) vs. the strain that recovers worse (BALB\/c) will help for the prediction of target genes in PAD. Our bioinformatics analysis identified several genes that are differentially expressed between the two mouse strains with known functions in PAD including TLR4, THBS1, and PRKAA2, and several genes with unknown functions in PAD including EphA4, TSPAN7, SLC22A4 and EIF2a.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003322","authors":["Chu, Liang-Hui","Vijay, Chaitanya G","Annex, Brian H","Bader, Joel S","Popel, Aleksander S"],"doi":"10.1152\/physiolgenomics.00125.2014","first_seen_on":"2015-06-11T12:01:20+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi","nci"],"issns":["1531-2267","1094-8341"],"issue":"8","journal":"Physiological Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1462487107,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26058837?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26058837","pubdate":"2015-06-11T22:04:16+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"PADPIN: Protein-Protein Interaction Networks of Angiogenesis, Arteriogenesis, and Inflammation in Peripheral Arterial Disease.","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/padpin-proteinprotein-interaction-networks-angiogenesis-arteriogenesis-inflammation-peripheral-arter"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7657182,"mean":6.5797688551388,"rank":3198361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4348291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7657182,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220046,"mean":8.1933375264152,"rank":85512,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":130035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220046,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":438,"mean":3.4722151029748,"rank":166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":438,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":3.4285714285714,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
