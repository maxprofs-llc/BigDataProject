Mast cells have been speculated to play a role in DENV disease although their precise roles are unclear. In this study, we used mast cell-deficient Kit(W-sh\/W-sh) mice to investigate the involvement of mast cells after intradermal DENV infection. An approximately 2 to 3-fold higher level of DENV NS3 antigen was detected at the skin inoculation site in DENV-infected Kit(W-sh\/W-sh) mice than in DENV-infected wild-type (WT) mice (using a dose of 1 \u00d7 10(9) PFU\/mouse). Moreover, as an indicator of heightened pathogenesis, a more prolonged bleeding time was observed in DENV-infected Kit(W-sh\/W-sh) mice than in WT mice. Since monocytes\/macrophages are considered to be important targets for DENV infection, we investigated the susceptibility and chemokine response of DENV-infected peritoneal macrophages from Kit(W-sh\/W-sh) and WT mice both ex vivo and in vivo. There was a tendency for higher DENV infection and higher secretion of CCL2 (MCP-1) from peritoneal macrophages isolated from Kit(W-sh\/W-sh) mice than those from WT mice. In vivo studies using intradermal inoculation of DENV showed about 2-fold higher levels of infiltrating macrophages and CCL2 (MCP-1) at the inoculation site in both mock control and DENV-inoculated Kit(W-sh\/W-sh) mice than in corresponding WT mice. In summary, compared to WT mice, Kit(W-sh\/W-sh) mice show enhanced DENV infection and macrophage infiltration at the skin inoculation site as well as increased DENV-associated bleeding time. The results indicate an intriguing interplay between mast cells and tissue macrophages to restrict DENV replication in the skin. This article is protected by copyright.
