Proteins from the tetraspanin family in parasites have recently become regarded as crucial molecules in interaction with hosts in parasitism and are therefore suitable for the development of vaccines and diagnostic agents. However, no information is available to date on E. granulosus tetraspanin.\nIn this study, a uroplakin-I-like tetraspanin (Eg-TSP1) of E. granulosus was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The immunolocalization of Eg-TSP1 in different life stages of E. granulosus was determined using specific polyclonal antibody. The antibody and cytokine profiles of mice that immunized with recombinant Eg-TSP1 (rEg-TSP1) were measured for the immunogenicity analysis of this protein. Additionally, we use RNA interference method to explore the biological function of Eg-TSP1 in larva of E. granulosus.\nImmunofluorescence analysis showed that endogenous Eg-TSP1 mainly localized in the tegument of larvae and adults. Significantly elevated levels of antibodies IgG1 and IgG2a and of cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 were observed in the sera of mice after immunization with rEg-TSP1, suggesting a typical T helper (Th)1-mediated immune response elicited by rEg-TSP1. On further probing the role of Eg-TSP1 in E. granulosus by RNA interference, we found that a thinner tegmental distal cytoplasm was induced in protoscoleces treated with siRNA-132 compared to controls.\nThis is the first report characterizing a tetraspanin from the tapeworm E. granulosus. Our results suggest that Eg-TSP1 is associated with biogenesis of the tegument and maintenance of structural integrity of E. granulosus and could therefore be a candidate intervention target for control of hydatid disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000883","authors":["Hu, Dandan","Song, Xingju","Xie, Yue","Zhong, Xiuqin","Wang, Ning","Zheng, Yu","Gu, Xiaobin","Wang, Tao","Peng, Xuerong","Yang, Guangyou","Dandan Hu","Xingju Song","Yue Xie","Xiuqin Zhong","Ning Wang","Yu Zheng","Xiaobin Gu","Tao Wang","Xuerong Peng","Guangyou Yang"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13071-015-0926-y","first_seen_on":"2015-06-11T01:08:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1756-3305"],"issue":"1","journal":"Parasites & Vectors","last_mentioned_on":1457738529,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26055542?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26055542","pubdate":"2015-06-11T22:07:17+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Molecular insights into a tetraspanin in the hydatid tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.parasitesandvectors.com\/content\/8\/1\/311","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-insights-tetraspanin-hydatid-tapeworm-echinococcus-granulosus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7380163,"mean":6.412201927,"rank":3054601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4219027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7380163,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":218038,"mean":8.1210677637283,"rank":84344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":129296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":218038,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1990,"mean":3.559872297637,"rank":706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":1221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1990,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":3.1071401869159,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
