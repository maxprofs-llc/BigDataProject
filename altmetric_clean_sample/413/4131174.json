It is well known that serine-phosphorylation of beta-catenin by the Axin-glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta complex targets beta-catenin for ubiquitination-degradation, and mutations at critical phosphoserine residues stabilize beta-catenin and cause human cancers. How beta-catenin phosphorylation results in its degradation is undefined. Here we show that phosphorylated beta-catenin is specifically recognized by beta-Trcp, an F-box\/WD40-repeat protein that also associates with Skp1, an essential component of the ubiquitination apparatus. beta-catenin harboring mutations at the critical phosphoserine residues escapes recognition by beta-Trcp, thus providing a molecular explanation for why these mutations cause beta-catenin accumulation that leads to cancer. Inhibition of endogenous beta-Trcp function by a dominant negative mutant stabilizes beta-catenin, activates Wnt\/beta-catenin signaling, and induces axis formation in Xenopus embryos. Therefore, beta-Trcp plays a central role in recruiting phosphorylated beta-catenin for degradation and in dorsoventral patterning of the Xenopus embryo.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Liu, C","Kato, Y","Zhang, Z","Do, V M","Yankner, B A","He, X"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-10T18:47:58+00:00","issns":["0027-8424"],"issue":"11","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1322531442,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10339577"],"pmcid":"PMC26871","pmid":"10339577","pubdate":"1999-05-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"beta-Trcp couples beta-catenin phosphorylation-degradation and regulates Xenopus axis formation.","type":"article","volume":"96","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/%CE%B2trcp-couples-catenin-phosphorylationdegradation-regulates-xenopus-axis-formation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4005088,"mean":5.03309580761,"rank":919156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2531872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4005088,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114040,"mean":6.9422243036556,"rank":32049,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":79191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114040,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35529,"mean":14.025885661206,"rank":14058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":14538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35529,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":947,"mean":18.373350951374,"rank":479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":947,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
