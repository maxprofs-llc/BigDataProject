In Western countries the usual calcium intake is of the order of 800-1000 mg\/day; in many developing countries figures of 300-500 mg\/day are found. There is no evidence that people with such a low intake have any problems with bones or teeth. It seems likely that normal people can adapt to have a normal calcium balance on calcium intakes as low as 150-200 mg\/day and that this adaptation is sufficient even in pregnancy and lactation. Inappropriate concern about calcium intake may divert attention and resources from more important nutritional problems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003370","authors":["Paterson, C R"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-11T05:45:25+00:00","issns":["0032-5473"],"issue":"630","journal":"Postgraduate Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1434001504,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/351589"],"pmcid":"PMC2425246","pmid":"351589","pubdate":"1978-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Calcium requirements in man: a critical review.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/calcium-requirements-man-critical-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5218786,"mean":6.1556744974188,"rank":2766100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1772773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5218786,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177517,"mean":8.6521126433675,"rank":99331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":60678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177517,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1106,"mean":5.6956669683258,"rank":696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1106,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":6.5435294117647,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/allanhaddad1991\/status\/608872558679715840","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4133786],"posted_on":"2015-06-11T05:45:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Allan Haddad","url":"http:\/\/www.AllanLife.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/582185096637120512\/klGYcdZN_normal.jpg","description":"Embracing the mission of promoting a healthy lifestyle and inspiring people to find their highest values and live on their purpose.","id_on_source":"allanhaddad1991","tweeter_id":"61969005","geo":{"lt":-33.86785,"ln":151.20732,"country":"AU"},"followers":44},"tweet_id":"608872558679715840"}]}}
