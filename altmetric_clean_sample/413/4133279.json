Previously, we reported an increase of NK cells expressing NKG2C, CD57 and inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) in response to CMV reactivation post-HCT. These NK cells persist after the resolution of infection and display 'adaptive' or memory properties. Despite these findings, the differential impact of persistent\/inactive vs. reactivated CMV on NK vs. T cell maturation following HCT from different graft sources has not been defined. We compared the phenotype of NK and T cells from 292 recipients of allogeneic sibling (n = 118) or umbilical cord blood (UCB; n = 174) grafts based on recipient pre-transplant CMV serostatus and post-HCT CMV reactivation. This cohort was utilized to evaluate CMV-dependent increases in KIR-expressing NK cells exhibiting an 'adaptive' phenotype (NKG2C(+)CD57(+)). Compared to CMV seronegative recipients, those who reactivated CMV (React(+)) had the highest adaptive cell frequencies, while intermediate frequencies were observed in CMV seropositive recipients harboring persistent\/non-replicating CMV. The same effect was observed in T cells and CD56(+) T cells. These adaptive lymphocyte subsets were increased in CMV seropositive recipients of sibling, but not UCB grafts, and correlated with lower rates of CMV reactivation (sibling 33% vs. UCB 51%; p<0.01). These data suggest that persistent\/non-replicating recipient CMV induces rapid production of adaptive NK and T cells from mature cells from sibling, but not UCB grafts. These adaptive lymphocytes are associated with protection from CMV reactivation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e3","authors":["Davis, Zachary B","Cooley, Sarah A","Cichocki, Frank","Felices, Martin","Wangen, Rose","Luo, Xianghua","DeFor, Todd E","Bryceson, Yenan T","Diamond, Don J","Brunstein, Claudio","Blazar, Bruce R","Wagner, John E","Weisdorf, Daniel J","Horowitz, Amir","Guethlein, Lisbeth A","Parham, Peter","Verneris, Michael R","Miller, Jeffrey S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbmt.2015.05.025","endpage":"1662","first_seen_on":"2015-06-11T03:26:35+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci","nhlbi","niaid"],"issns":["1523-6536","10838791"],"issue":"9","journal":"Biology of Blood & Marrow Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1449278698,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26055301?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26055301?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26055301?dopt=Citation"],"pmid":"26055301","pubdate":"2015-06-11T22:07:30+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1653","subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Adaptive NK cell and KIR-expressing T cell responses are induced by CMV and are associated with protection against CMV reactivation after allogeneic donor hematopoietic cell transplantation(1).","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adaptive-natural-killer-cell-killer-cell-immunoglobulinlike-receptorexpressing-t-cell-responses-indu-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6650505,"mean":6.1597281108294,"rank":2229588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4399281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6650505,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":214939,"mean":8.0127625454784,"rank":69279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":144321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":214939,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1100,"mean":2.9538234758872,"rank":316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":777,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1100,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":4.3173076923077,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
