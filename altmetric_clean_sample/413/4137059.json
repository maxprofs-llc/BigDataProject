To estimate the potential added benefit of routine infant HB immunization, notifiable disease reports were analyzed (1990-2013). Clinical and demographic information about cases was retrieved from standard questionnaires used by local public health units to investigate HB cases.\nThe Quebec provincial registry of notifiable diseases was used to identify confirmed HB cases reported between 1990 and 2013. Clinical and demographic information on cases was retrieved from the standard questionnaires used by local public health units to investigate reported HB cases.\nBetween 1990-2013, acute-HB incidence per 100,000 population decreased by 97\u00a0% from 6.5 to 0.2. Compared to 1990, incidence fell from 0.6 to zero since 2010 among children \u22649\u00a0years of age (yoa), from 3.2 to zero since 2007 in those 10-19 yoa, and from 15 to zero in 2013 among adults 20-29 yoa, previously the age group of highest incidence (all p\u2009<\u20090.0001). During the same period, the newly-reported chronic HB rate per 100,000 decreased by 66\u00a0% from 17.7 to 6.1 (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), with a reduction of 92\u00a0% (2.4 to 0.2;p\u2009<\u20090.001) in children \u22649 yoa and 83\u00a0% (7.2 to 1.2;p\u2009=\u20090.003) in those 10-19 yoa. The incidence of unspecified HB cases did not decrease significantly overall (5.9 vs. 5.4; p\u2009=\u20090.24), in children\u2009\u2264\u20099 yoa (0.3 vs. 0.2;p\u2009=\u20090.70) or 10-19 yoa (1.6 vs. 1.5;p\u2009=\u20090.45). Overall, 91\u00a0% of cases \u226419 yoa were immigrants likely infected before arrival in Canada. Among those \u22649 yoa, there were 9 acute-HB case reports between 2005 and 2013, of whom 8 were not preventable by infant immunization.\nTwo decades of school-based immunization coupled with prenatal screening achieved striking reduction in disease burden in the low-endemicity province of Quebec, Canada. The oldest cohorts targeted by catch-up campaigns are now beyond the average age at childbirth so that neo-natal transmission and the potential incremental benefit of infant immunization will likely further diminish.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","authors":["Teegwend\u00e9 V Porgo","Vladimir Gilca","Gaston De Serres","Mich\u00e8le Tremblay","Danuta Skowronski"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12879-015-0979-8","first_seen_on":"2015-06-12T00:01:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2334"],"journal":"BMC Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1434997788,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2334\/15\/227"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12879-015-0979-8.pdf","pmid":"26062979","pubdate":"2015-06-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tropical Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Dramatic reduction in hepatitis B through school-based immunization without a routine infant program in a low endemicity region","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dramatic-reduction-hepatitis-b-through-schoolbased-immunization-without-routine-infant-program-low-e"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5263697,"mean":6.1954563656434,"rank":1064491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":4193555,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5263697,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178682,"mean":8.6461507602936,"rank":46075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":132313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178682,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2800,"mean":3.2356277241872,"rank":439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":2359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2800,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":3.3773846153846,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
