In this article we review the published literature related to phytoestrogens and breast cancer as well as suggest the possible mechanisms that may underlie the relationship between phytoestrogens and breast cancer.\nElectronic searches on phytoestrogens and breast cancer were performed on MEDLINE and EMBASE in June 2007. No date restriction was placed on the electronic search.\nWe focused on experimental data from published studies that examined the characteristics of phytoestrogens using in vivo or in vitro models. We also include human intervention studies in this review.\nWe evaluated evidence regarding the possible mechanisms of phytoestrogen action. Discussions of these mechanisms were organized into those activities related to the estrogen receptor, cell growth and proliferation, tumor development, signaling pathways, and estrogen-metabolizing enzymes.\nWe suggest that despite numerous investigations, the mechanisms of phytoestrogen action in breast cancer have yet to be elucidated. It remains uncertain whether these plant compounds are chemoprotective or whether they may produce adverse outcomes related to breast carcinogenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027e9","authors":["Mense, Sarah M","Hei, Tom K","Ganju, Ramesh K","Bhat, Hari K","Sarah M.
