Serum albumin (ALB) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were also collected. Survival curves were obtained with the Kaplan-Meier method, and the differences between groups in survival were tested by the log-rank test.\nThe median age was 59 years (range, 40-80 years). Fourteen patients underwent mutational analysis of EGFR; of these, 12 had wild-type EGFR and the remaining two had EGFR mutations in exons. The median disease-free survival (DFS) of pulmonary LCNEC was 49.3 months and that of overall survival (OS) was not reached. DFS and OS were shorter for patients with decreased serum ALB than for patients with normal serum ALB (P=0.003 and P=0.004, respectively). Meanwhile, a high level of NSE was also significantly associated with short DFS and OS (P=0.005 and P=0.000, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that decrease in serum ALB was an independent prognostic factor for OS (P=0.046).\nThe frequency of EGFR mutation in LCNEC patients is low. Serum ALB and NSE levels are valuable prognostic factors for LCNEC patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bca2","authors":["Xin-ke Zhang","Yuanyuan Zhao","Li Zhang","Cong Xue","Zhihuang Hu","Wen-feng Fang","Tao Qin","Hong-yun Zhao","Yu-xiang Ma","Ting Zhou","Xue Hou","Yin-duo Zeng","Yan Huang","Yun-peng Yang","Shao-dong Hong"],"doi":"10.2147\/ott.s83347","first_seen_on":"2015-06-10T22:02:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-6930"],"journal":"OncoTargets and therapy","last_mentioned_on":1432770222,"links":["http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=21905"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=25214","pmid":"26060407","pubdate":"2015-06-11T22:02:09+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Clinical analysis of 50 Eastern Asian patients with primary pulmonary large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/clinical-analysis-of-50-eastern-asian-patients-with-primary-pulmonary--peer-reviewed-article-OTT","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-analysis-50-eastern-asian-patients-primary-pulmonary-largecell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5153898,"mean":6.0935305781261,"rank":4285328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5153898,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175938,"mean":8.6479467650354,"rank":143340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175938,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":617,"mean":1.2893993506494,"rank":369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":617,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":0.67307692307692,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
