The results of the 3 methods were compared with one another.\nThe maternal interview showed the lowest sensitivity in detecting cocaine and opiate exposures (65% and 67%, respectively), but it had the highest sensitivity in detecting cannabinoid exposure (58%). Both hair and meconium analyses had high sensitivity for detecting cocaine or opiate exposures. Hair analysis had a sensitivity of 100% for cocaine and 80% for opiate detection. However, it had a false-positive rate of 13% for cocaine and 20% for opiate, probably as a result of passive exposure. Meconium analysis had a sensitivity of 87% for cocaine and 77% for opiate detection, but unlike hair analysis, it had no false-positive test results for cocaine. Both hair and meconium analyses had low sensitivity in detecting cannabinoid exposure (21%-22.7%), most probably because of the sporadic use of cannabinoid.\nMeconium and hair analyses had the highest sensitivities for detecting perinatal use of cocaine and opiate, but not for cannabinoid. The principal drawback of hair analysis is its potential for false-positive test results associated with passive exposure to drugs. Maternal interview is a time-consuming test of low sensitivity. The high sensitivity of meconium analysis and the ease of collection make this test ideal for perinatal drug screening.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a88","authors":["Ostrea, E M","Knapp, D K","Tannenbaum, L","Ostrea, A R","Romero, A","Salari, V","Ager, J"],"doi":"10.1067\/mpd.2001.111429","first_seen_on":"2015-06-12T02:18:47+00:00","issns":["0022-3476"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1281656197,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11241040"],"pmid":"11241040","pubdate":"2001-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Estimates of illicit drug use during pregnancy by maternal interview, hair analysis, and meconium analysis.","type":"article","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/estimates-illicit-drug-during-pregnancy-maternal-interview-hair-analysis-meconium-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4003953,"mean":5.0337731653256,"rank":919102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2531642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4003953,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112369,"mean":6.9070855525494,"rank":31499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":78085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112369,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2768,"mean":4.9707712323816,"rank":674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1742,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2768,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":3.3600963855422,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
