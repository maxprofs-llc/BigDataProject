The BmaN1 amylase with seemingly aberrant catalytic machinery."],"citation":{"abstract":"\u03b1-Amylases are glycoside hydrolase enzymes that act on the \u03b1(1\u21924) glycosidic linkages in glycogen, starch, and related \u03b1-glucans, and are ubiquitously present in Nature. Most \u03b1-amylases have been classified in glycoside hydrolase family 13 with a typical (\u03b2\/\u03b1)8-barrel containing two aspartic acid and one glutamic acid residue that play an essential role in catalysis. An atypical \u03b1-amylase (BmaN1) with only two of the three invariant catalytic residues present was isolated from Bacillus megaterium strain NL3, a bacterial isolate from a sea anemone of Kakaban landlocked marine lake, Derawan Island, Indonesia. In BmaN1 the third residue, the aspartic acid that acts as the transition state stabilizer, was replaced by a histidine. Three-dimensional structure modeling of the BmaN1 amino acid sequence confirmed the aberrant catalytic triad. Glucose and maltose were found as products of the action of the novel \u03b1-amylase on soluble starch, demonstrating that it is active in spite of the peculiar catalytic triad. This novel BmaN1 \u03b1-amylase is part of a group of \u03b1-amylases that all have this atypical catalytic triad, consisting of aspartic acid, glutamic acid and histidine. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this group of \u03b1-amylases comprises a new subfamily of the glycoside hydrolase family 13.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Fean D.
