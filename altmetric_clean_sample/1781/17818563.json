The efficiency of the treatment was measured as the ratio of reduction of the amblyopia at the end of the occlusion.\nThe efficiency of the occlusion is shown to depend on the age of the onset of the treatment: recovery of acuity of the amblyopic eye was maximum when the occlusion was initiated before 3 years of age, decreased as a function of age and was about null by the time the patient was 12 years of age.\nThis is assumed to be an indication of the sensitive period for strabismic amblyopia in humans. The results are discussed on the basis of the neurophysiological mechanisms of amblyopia established in animals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003250","authors":["Marc Epelbaum","Chantal Milleret","Pierre Buisseret","Jean Louis Duffer"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0161-6420(13)32170-8","first_seen_on":"2017-03-19T20:57:37+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["01616420","0161-6420"],"issue":"3","journal":"Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1504224000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0161-6420(13)32170-8"],"pmid":"8460000","pubdate":"1993-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"The Sensitive Period for Strabismic Amblyopia in Humans","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0161642013321708","volume":"100","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sensitive-period-strabismic-amblyopia-humans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454259,"mean":7.1045520782463,"rank":1411173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6965225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454259,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248710,"mean":13.466379342926,"rank":61920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":186461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248710,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2614,"mean":10.80458783008,"rank":415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":2175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2614,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":7.879512195122,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
