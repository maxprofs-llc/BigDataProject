Many bacteria approach this problem by producing toxins that can breach the endothelial barrier through diverse creative mechanisms, including directly killing endothelial cells (ECs), weakening the cytoskeleton within ECs, and breaking the junctions between ECs. Toxins can also modulate the immune response by influencing endothelial biology, and can modulate endothelial function by influencing the response of leukocytes. Understanding these interactions, in both the in vitro and in vivo contexts, is of critical importance for designing new therapies for sepsis and other severe bacterial diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a5","authors":["Ashira Lubkin","Victor J Torres"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mib.2016.11.008","first_seen_on":"2017-03-19T16:46:01+00:00","funders":["niaid","nigms"],"issns":["13695274"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1489941948,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S136952741630217X"],"pmid":"28013162","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Bacteria and endothelial cells: a toxic relationship","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S136952741630217X","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bacteria-endothelial-cells-toxic-relationship"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":6364433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1136885,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246885,"mean":13.458213792712,"rank":177938,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246885,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":860,"mean":5.5041699650757,"rank":704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":860,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":6.495375,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
