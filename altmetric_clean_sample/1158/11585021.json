A rapid and highly reproducible liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) method were established for determining tryptophan, kynurenine and kynurenic acid in human serum. Biological samples were precipitated with methanol before separation on an Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18. The stable-isotope-labeled internal standards (kynurenine-(13)C4 (15)N and kynurenic acid-d5) were used for quantification. Detection was performed using multiple reaction monitoring in electrospray ionization mode at m\/z 205.1\u2192188.1 for tryptophan, m\/z 209.1\u2192146.1 for kynurenine, m\/z 190.1\u2192144.1 for kynurenic acid. Good linearity of analyte to internal standard peak area ratios was seen in the concentration range 1,000-50,000 ng\/mL for tryptophan, 100-5,000 ng\/mL for kynurenine and 1-60 ng\/mL for kynurenic acid. Pooled drug-free human serum was purified using activated charcoal and the method was shown to be linear, with validation parameters within acceptable limits. The newly developed method was successfully used to determine concentrations of tryptophan, kynurenine and kynurenic acid in serum from 26 healthy volunteers and 54 patients with depression. Concentrations of tryptophan and kynurenine were lower in serum from depressed individuals than from healthy individuals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c7e","authors":["Li-Jun Hu","Xiao-Fang Li","Jin-Qing Hu","Xiao-Jia Ni","Hao-Yang Lu","Jia-Jia Wang","Xiang-Ning Huang","Chao-Xian Lin","De-Wei Shang","Yu-Guan Wen","Hu, Li-Jun","Li, Xiao-Fang","Hu, Jin-Qing","Ni, Xiao-Jia","Lu, Hao-Yang","Wang, Jia-Jia","Huang, Xiang-Ning","Lin, Chao-Xian","Shang, De-Wei","Wen, Yu-Guan"],"doi":"10.1093\/jat\/bkw071","first_seen_on":"2016-09-03T06:33:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1945-2403","0146-4760"],"journal":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1473026655,"links":["http:\/\/jat.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/09\/01\/jat.bkw071.short?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27590037?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27590037?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=anxietynews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jat.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/09\/01\/jat.bkw071.full.pdf","pmid":"27590037","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"title":"A Simple HPLC\u2013MS\/MS Method for Determination of Tryptophan, Kynurenine and Kynurenic Acid in Human Serum and its Potential for Monitoring Antidepressant Therapy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simple-hplcmsms-method-determination-tryptophan-kynurenine-kynurenic-acid-human-serum-potential-moni"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8324953,"mean":7.0165383958894,"rank":6020068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2007597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8324953,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252028,"mean":12.465977819836,"rank":163995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":73590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252028,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":855,"mean":5.6862014051522,"rank":683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":855,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":15.482,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
