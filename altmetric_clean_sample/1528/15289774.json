In this work, the larger pore size of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (P1-MSN) was synthesized and then, P1-MSN were functionalized by succinic anhydride (S-P1-MSN) and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) (AP-CO-P1-MSN) using the grafting and co-condensation methods, respectively. A new method was used for the functionalization of P1-MSN by succinic anhydride at room temperature. Nanoparticles were characterized by special instrumental analysis and loaded by RT. Maximum entrapment efficiency and RT loading percentage into P1-MSN, AP-CO-P1-MSN, and S-P1-MSN were respectively obtained 21.26 and 25.5%, 41.5 and 49.8%, and 11.9 and 14.28% for 24\u2009hours. In the simulated gastric and body fluids, the release rate of RT-loaded AP-CO-P1-MSN (AP-CO-P1-MSN-RT) was lower than that of other RT-loaded nanoparticles. In oral pathway, the sustained release of RT was observed in AP-CO-P1-MSN-RT. Moreover, no cytotoxicity effect was observed for P1-MSN, but the cells treated by AP-CO-P1-MSN showed a reduction in SY5Y cell viability due to easy entrance of these nanoparticles and their accumulation in different parts of the cell as observed by TEM.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5613cf058f61000494d","authors":["Karimzadeh, Mahmonir","Rashidi, Ladan","Ganji, Fariba"],"doi":"10.1080\/03639045.2016.1275668","endpage":"29","first_seen_on":"2017-01-07T05:14:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5762","0363-9045"],"journal":"Drug Development & Industrial Pharmacy","last_mentioned_on":1483766022,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28043167"],"pmid":"28043167","pubdate":"2017-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["pharmacy"],"title":"Mesoporous silica nanoparticles for efficient Rivastigmine Hydrogen Tartrate delivery into SY5Y cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mesoporous-silica-nanoparticles-efficient-rivastigmine-hydrogen-tartrate-delivery-sy5y-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002981,"mean":6.7515998143141,"rank":1122036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6808397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002981,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253423,"mean":12.65855405608,"rank":54028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":195961,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253423,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":415,"mean":3.021806763285,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":415,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
