It is a rather prevalent condition, with impacts on patient survival, response to treatment, and quality of life. Treatment options are sparse because of cachexia's multifactorial pathogenesis. Recently, attention has focused on microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential therapeutic targets of several diseases. miRNAs are small, 18- to 25-base-long constructs that regulate gene expression on a post-transcriptional level, selectively activating or repressing elements of specific signaling pathways. In this review, we investigated whether miRNAs play any role in cachexia's biochemical pathways and if miRNA targeting has any significant impact on preclinical models of cachexia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6133cf058f610007021","authors":["F\u00e1bio Sousa Nunes","Daniel Moreira-Gon\u00e7alves","Tiago Henriques-Coelho"],"doi":"10.1615\/critreveukaryotgeneexpr.2017019085","first_seen_on":"2017-08-29T14:47:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1045-4403"],"issue":"2","journal":"Critical Reviews\u0099 in Eukaryotic Gene Expression","last_mentioned_on":1504076469,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28845764?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28845764"],"pmid":"28845764","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Mini-Review on Cachexia-Related miRNA","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/minireview-cachexiarelated-mirna"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":6108977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2038776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174845,"mean":12.498166319691,"rank":113238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":51050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174845,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":1.6320512820513,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/902543250434670593","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24484069],"posted_on":"2017-08-29T14:47:34+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
