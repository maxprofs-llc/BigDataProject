Sugarcane is an important cultivated crop with both high polyploidy and aneuploidy in its 10\u00a0Gb genome. Without a known copy number reference gene, it is difficult to accurately estimate the copy number of any gene of interest by PCR-based methods in sugarcane. Recently, a new technology, known as droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has been developed which can measure the absolute amount of the target DNA in a given sample. In this study, we deduced the true copy number of three endogenous genes, actin depolymerizing factor (ADF), adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) and actin (ACT) in three Australian sugarcane varieties, using ddPCR by comparing the absolute amounts of the above genes with a transgene of known copy number. A single copy of the ACT allele was detected in Q208 (A) , two copies in Q240 (A) , but was absent in Q117. Copy number variation was also observed for both APRT and ADF, and ranged from 9 to 11 in the three tested varieties. Using this newly developed ddPCR method, transgene copy number was successfully determined in 19 transgenic Q208 (A) and Q240 (A) events using ACT as the reference endogenous gene. Our study demonstrates that ddPCR can be used for high-throughput genetic analysis and is a quick, accurate and reliable alternative method for gene copy number determination in sugarcane. This discovered ACT allele would be a suitable endogenous reference gene for future gene copy number variation and dosage studies of functional genes in Q208 (A) and Q240 (A) .","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003336","authors":["Yue Sun","Priya Aiyar Joyce"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00299-017-2193-1","first_seen_on":"2017-08-29T14:06:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0721-7714","1432-203X"],"journal":"Plant Cell Reports","last_mentioned_on":1506687650,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00299-017-2193-1","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28849385?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00299-017-2193-1.pdf","pmid":"28849385","pubdate":"2017-08-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Application of droplet digital PCR to determine copy number of endogenous genes and transgenes in sugarcane","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/application-droplet-digital-pcr-determine-copy-number-endogenous-genes-transgenes-sugarcane"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.25,"1w":0.25,"6d":0.25,"5d":0.25,"4d":0.25,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":6420800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1150617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180699,"mean":12.448851819057,"rank":127840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":32982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180699,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":675,"mean":1.627940652819,"rank":344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":675,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.3616666666667,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
