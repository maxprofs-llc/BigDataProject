Automated differentiation of abnormal gait from normal gait can serve as a potential tool for early diagnosis as well as monitoring the effect of PD treatment. The aim of current study is to differentiate PD patients from healthy controls, on the basis of features derived from plantar vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) data during walking at normal pace. The current work presents a comprehensive study highlighting the efficacy of different machine learning classifiers towards devising an accurate prediction system. Selection of meaningful feature based on sequential forward feature selection, the swing time, stride time variability, and center of pressure features facilitated successful classification of control and PD gaits. Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest, and decision trees classifiers were used to build the prediction model. We found that SVM with cubic kernel outperformed other classifiers with an accuracy of 93.6%, the sensitivity of 93.1%, and specificity of 94.1%. In comparison to other studies, utilizing same dataset, our designed prediction system improved the classification performance by approximately 10%. The results of the current study underscore the ability of the VGRF data obtained non-invasively from wearable devices, in combination with a SVM classifier trained on meticulously selected features, as a tool for diagnosis of PD and monitoring effectiveness of therapy post pathology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Md Nafiul Alam","Amanmeet Garg","Tamanna Tabassum Khan Munia","Reza Fazel-Rezai","Kouhyar Tavakolian"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0175951","first_seen_on":"2017-05-13T23:32:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1494769538,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0175951"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0175951&type=printable","pmid":"28493868","pubdate":"2017-05-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Vertical ground reaction force marker for Parkinson\u2019s disease","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vertical-ground-reaction-force-marker-parkinsons-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204367,"mean":6.945700472644,"rank":4120470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3874788,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204367,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238123,"mean":12.38321867782,"rank":120633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":107365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238123,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113886,"mean":10.57073946525,"rank":60294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":48095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113886,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4184,"mean":10.187408080325,"rank":2028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":1952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4184,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
