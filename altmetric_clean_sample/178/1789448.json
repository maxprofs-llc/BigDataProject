The specificity of the major enzyme, nepenthesin, was broader than previously reported, and strikingly similar to that of pepsin. Lipase activity was also demonstrated, while no amylase activity was present.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100066f4","authors":["Zolt\u00c3\u00a1n A.
