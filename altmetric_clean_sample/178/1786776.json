It usually results from the structural compromise of the upper airway. In patients with OSA, the obstruction predominantly occurs along the pharyngeal airway, and also a variety of tumors have been reported to cause such a condition. We present here the case of a thyroglossal duct cyst causing OSA in adult. This case demonstrates that thyroglossal duct cyst or some kind of mass lesions in the airway lesions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of OSA patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbf5","authors":["Hahn Jin Jung","Jeong-Whun Kim","Chul Hee Lee","Young Jun Chung","Ji-Hun Mo"],"doi":"10.3342\/ceo.2013.6.3.187","first_seen_on":"2013-09-27T10:54:25+00:00","issns":["1976-8710"],"issue":"3","journal":"Clinical and Experimental Otorhinolaryngology","last_mentioned_on":1380279246,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24069524?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24069524","pubdate":"2013-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"A thyroglossal duct cyst causing obstructive sleep apnea in adult.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thyroglossal-duct-cyst-causing-obstructive-sleep-apnea-adult-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3081249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":962441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98316,"mean":7.7478944209939,"rank":67411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":20348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98316,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":1.916,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"EG":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aghoury79\/status\/383545076997038081","license":"public","citation_ids":[1786776],"posted_on":"2013-09-27T10:54:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Ahmed Elaghoury","url":"http:\/\/eg.linkedin.com\/in\/aghoury","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/749706574990573568\/1hdbWkTG_normal.jpg","description":"Physician specialized & blogging in psychiatry, sleep medicine & related neurology.","id_on_source":"aghoury79","tweeter_id":"55548061","geo":{"lt":31.21564,"ln":29.95527,"country":"EG"},"followers":2027},"tweet_id":"383545076997038081"}]}}
