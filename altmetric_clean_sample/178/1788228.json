A thin Al2O3 barrier inserted into an amorphous-C\/Ni bilayer stack is demonstrated to enable growth of uniform monolayer graphene at 600 \u00b0C with domain sizes exceeding 50 \u03bcm, and an average Raman D\/G ratio of <0.07. A detailed growth rationale is established via in situ measurements, relevant to solid-state growth of a wide range of layered materials, as well as layer-by-layer control in these systems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Robert S.
