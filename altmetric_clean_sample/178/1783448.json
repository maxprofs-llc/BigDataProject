The infrared (975-nm) pulse with a duration of 4 ns pumps the ground state to the 4f excited state with the transition of (2)F(5\/2) \u2190 (2)F(7\/2), and the second photon (355-nm) generates the charge transfer (CT) state of Cl 3p to Yb 4f; the reduction then occurs. Laser energy and excitation wavelength dependencies well-explain the above mechanism. The product Yb(2+) was detected by its absorption spectrum peak at 367 nm. The absorption spectrum of the intermediate in the two-photon chemistry was measured from the 4f excited state ((2)F(5\/2)) to the CT state by nanosecond laser photolysis. The intermediate spectrum appears in the wavelengths shorter than 400 nm with the molar extinction coefficient on the order of (10(2) M(-1) cm(-1)) at 340 nm and can be explained in terms of the CT absorption shifted by IR photon energy. A UV nanosecond laser pulse (266 nm from a YAG laser with a duration of 6 ns) can generate the reactive CT state by one-photon absorption and leads to Yb(2+) formation. The reaction yields for single-photon UV excitation and the second photon in the two-photon excitation are on the order of 0.1, suggesting that the reactive states are a common CT state.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","authors":["Nobuaki Nakashima","Ken-ichi Yamanaka","Tomoyuki Yatsuhashi"],"doi":"10.1021\/jp402194g","first_seen_on":"2013-09-26T07:25:46+00:00","issns":["1089-5639","1520-5215"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry A","last_mentioned_on":1380182914,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jp402194g"],"pmid":"23968280","pubdate":"2013-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atomic, Molecular, Nuclear, Particle And Plasma Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
