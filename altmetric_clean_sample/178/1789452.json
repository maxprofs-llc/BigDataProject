Despite two decades of research on treatment options, the chances of survival are still less than 5% upon diagnosis. Recently, chemopreventive strategies have gained considerable attention as an alternative to treatment. We have previously shown significant in vitro chemopreventive effects with low-dose combinations of aspirin, curcumin, and sulforaphane (ACS) on pancreatic cancer cell lines. Here, we report the results of 24-week chemopreventive study with the oral administration of ACS combinations on the N-nitrosobis (2-oxopropyl) amine (BOP)-treated Syrian golden hamster model to suppress the progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanIN) using unmodified (free drug) combinations of ACS, and nanoencapsulated (solid lipid nanoparticles; SLN) combinations of aspirin, curcumin, and free sulforaphane. The use of three different doses (low, medium, and high) of unmodified ACS combinations exhibited reduction in tumor incidence by 18%, 50%, and 68.7% respectively; whereas the modified nanoencapsulated ACS regimens reduced tumor incidence by 33%, 67%, and 75%, respectively, at 10 times lower dose compared with the free drug combinations. Similarly, although the unmodified free ACS showed a notable reduction in cell proliferation, the SLN encapsulated ACS regimens showed significant reduction in cell proliferation at 6.3%, 58.6%, and 72.8% as evidenced by proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression. Cell apoptotic indices were also upregulated by 1.5, 2.8, and 3.2 times, respectively, compared with BOP control. These studies provide a proof-of-concept for the use of an oral, low-dose, nanotechnology-based combinatorial regimen for the long-term chemoprevention of pancreatic cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd3","authors":["B Karthik Grandhi","Arvind Thakkar","Jeffrey Wang","Sunil Prabhu","Grandhi BK","Thakkar A","Wang J","Prabhu S"],"doi":"10.1158\/1940-6207.capr-13-0172","endpage":"1025","first_seen_on":"2013-09-29T02:29:50+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1940-6215","1940-6207"],"issue":"10","journal":"Cancer Prevention Research","last_mentioned_on":1408398152,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24072676\/?i=5&from=pancreatic%20cancer","http:\/\/cancerpreventionresearch.aacrjournals.org\/content\/6\/10\/1015.full","http:\/\/cancerprevres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/6\/10\/1015.short"],"pmid":"24072676","pubdate":"2013-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1015","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"A Novel Combinatorial Nanotechnology-Based Oral Chemopreventive Regimen Demonstrates Significant Suppression of Pancreatic Cancer Neoplastic Lesions","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-combinatorial-nanotechnologybased-oral-chemopreventive-regimen-demonstrates-significant-suppre"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6813995,"mean":6.1886153216424,"rank":392479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":6420875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6813995,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133549,"mean":6.916087848564,"rank":9200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":124336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133549,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":649,"mean":13.075703703704,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":649,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":20.582125,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
