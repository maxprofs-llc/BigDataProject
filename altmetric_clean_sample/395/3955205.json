These industries are similar in that some companies tried to hide or distort information showing their products were harmful. Common law claims were eventually filed to hold the corporations accountable and compensate the injured. This paper considers the important role the lawsuits played in helping establish some accountability for the industries while also noting the limitations of the lawsuits. It will be argued that the lawsuits helped create pressure for government regulation of the industries' products but were less successful at securing compensation for the injured. Thus, the common law claims strengthened and supported administrative regulation and the adoption of industry alternatives more than they provided a means of legal redress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f6100066ae","authors":["Christine Shearer","Shearer, Christine"],"doi":"10.1177\/1048291115583306","endpage":"188","first_seen_on":"2015-04-30T00:41:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1541-3772","1048-2911"],"issue":"2","journal":"New Solutions: A Journal of Environmental & Occupational Health Policy","last_mentioned_on":1437746521,"links":["http:\/\/new.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/04\/23\/1048291115583306.long","http:\/\/new.sagepub.com\/content\/25\/2\/172.abstract?etoc=","http:\/\/new.sagepub.com\/content\/25\/2\/172.abstract?etoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/new.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/04\/23\/1048291115583306.full.pdf","pmid":"25910492","pubdate":"2015-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"172","subjects":["environmentalhealth","occupationalmedicine"],"title":"On Corporate Accountability Lead, Asbestos, and Fossil Fuel Lawsuits","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/corporate-accountability-lead-asbestos-fossil-fuel-lawsuits"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5395620,"mean":6.2970774415334,"rank":1342590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":4038537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5395620,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162612,"mean":9.7267221036708,"rank":54210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":107630,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162612,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":6.2004375,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":5.073,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Environmental Science":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/grandmamavis\/status\/593668922299260928","license":"datasift","rt":["ChristineSheare"],"citation_ids":[3955205],"posted_on":"2015-04-30T06:51:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Mavis Nye BCAh","url":"http:\/\/www.onestopmesothelioma.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/899594923095330816\/cTkiulC2_normal.jpg","description":"Mesowarriors UK FB Mesothelioma UK Advocate Patient Rep EKent NHS Research St Barts Leic Saatchi Bill- Asbestos Activist \nhttp:\/\/rayandmave.wordpress.com\/","id_on_source":"grandmamavis","tweeter_id":"16923689","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2942},"tweet_id":"593668922299260928"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ChristineSheare\/status\/593575770280198144","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3955205],"posted_on":"2015-04-30T00:41:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Christine Shearer","url":"http:\/\/www.haymarketbooks.org\/pb\/Kivalina","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/852342256648323072\/VTFSMBdJ_normal.jpg","description":"All things energy\/climate.
