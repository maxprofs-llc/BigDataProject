Those cases were compared with the eyes of a reference collective (n\u2009=\u200930) and matched-pairs group (n\u2009=\u20098) after primary DMEK for Fuchs endothelial dystrophy.\nDescemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty.\nPostoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central corneal thickness at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Intraoperatively obtained DSEK graft lenticels were investigated immunohistochemically.\nPatients with graft failure after DSEK had a mean (SD) age of 79.4\u2009(7.2) years (range, 70-90 years). Preoperatively, the mean (SD) BCVA was 1.13\u2009(0.50) logMAR (20\/250 Snellen equivalents), and the mean (SD) central corneal thickness measured 704\u2009(161) \u00b5m. Twelve months postoperatively, the mean (SD) corneal thickness decreased to 524\u2009(27) \u00b5m after secondary and 516\u2009(27) \u00b5m after primary DMEK (P\u2009=\u2009.57). A mean (SD) BCVA of 0.38\u2009(0.36) logMAR (20\/50 Snellen equivalents) was achieved after secondary DMEK compared with 0.15\u2009(0.15) logMAR (20\/28 Snellen equivalents) after primary DMEK. Histologically, failed DSEK graft lenticels presented condensations of collagen layers. Fibronectin and cytokeratin were accumulated along the stroma-to-stroma interface; vimentin was found in loosened graft stroma.\nThese data suggest that DMEK might be considered a feasible choice in patients with graft failure after DSEK. However, the visual restitution might be impeded because of preceded depositions of matrix proteins within the corneal stroma and the stroma-to-stroma interface, which are associated with corneal fibrosis. Thereby, fibrotic processes might be avoided by performing a secondary DMEK in an early phase of graft failure.","altmetric_jid":"53bd372b2a83eef6128b456a","authors":["Tobias Brockmann","Claudia Brockmann","Anna-Karina Maier","Enken Gundlach","Jan Schroeter","Eckart Bertelmann","Antonia M.
