A minimally invasive technique consisting of an extensive percutaneous aponeurotomy of the cord with a needle combined with lipofilling is presented. The selective cutting of the cords under continuous tension disintegrates the cords while sparing the looser neurovascular bundles. Subsequently, lipoaspirate is injected subcutaneously. The authors' prospective results show a significantly shorter recovery time and less overall complications in this technique when compared with open surgery, while no significant difference was observed in the extent of immediate contracture correction and in the recurrence rate at 1\u00a0year follow-up.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6123cf058f610006f2a","authors":["Hovius, Steven E R","Kan, Hester J","Verhoekx, Jennifer S N","Khouri, Roger K"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cps.2015.03.006","first_seen_on":"2015-04-29T01:02:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0094-1298","1558-0504"],"issue":"3","journal":"Clinics in Plastic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1430269301,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.plasticsurgery.theclinics.com%2Farticle%2FS0094-1298%252815%252900019-X%2Fabstract%3FhootPostID%3Da564baf1e4cf81dafccd315d89345da6%26rss%3Dyes&code=cps-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.plasticsurgery.theclinics.com\/article\/S009412981500019X\/pdf","pmid":"26116943","pubdate":"2015-06-29T22:01:18+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Percutaneous Aponeurotomy and Lipofilling (PALF)","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/percutaneous-aponeurotomy-lipofilling-palf-regenerative-approach-dupuytren-contracture"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038209,"mean":5.9746183047646,"rank":2659584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1720859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038209,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156852,"mean":9.6603336669835,"rank":90542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":50777,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156852,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165,"mean":1.964243902439,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
