This move followed reports of increasingly alarming levels of pyrethroid resistance across the country. This study used the insecticide quantification kit (IQK) to investigate the intra-operational IRS coverage and quality of spraying, and decay rate of bendiocarb on different wall surfaces in Kagera region.\nTo assess intra-operational IRS coverage and quality of spraying, 104 houses were randomly selected out of 161,414 sprayed houses. A total of 509 samples (218 in Muleba and 291 in Karagwe) were obtained by scraping the insecticide samples from wall surfaces. To investigate decay rate, 66 houses (36 in Muleba and 30 in Karagwe) were selected and samples were collected monthly for a period of five months. Laboratory testing of insecticide concentration was done using IQK(TM) [Innovative Vector Control Consortium].\nOf the 509 samples, 89.5% met the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended concentration (between 100-400\u00a0mg\/m(2)) for IRS target dosage. The proportion of samples meeting WHO standards varied between Karagwe (84.3%) and Muleba (96.3%) (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Assessment of quality of spraying at house level revealed that Muleba (84.8%) had a significantly higher proportion of households that met the expected target dosage (100-400\u00a0mg\/m(2)) compared to Karagwe (68.9%) (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The quality of spraying varied across different wall substrates in both districts. Evaluation of bendiocarb decay showed that the proportion of houses with recommended concentration declined from 96.9%, 93.5% and 76.2% at months one, two, and three post IRS, respectively (p-trend\u2009=\u20090.03). The rate of decay increased in the fourth and fifth month post spraying with only 55.9% and 26.3% houses meeting the WHO recommendations, respectively.\nIQK is an important tool for assessing IRS coverage and quality of spraying. The study found adequate coverage of IRS; however, residual life of bendiocarb was observed to be three months. Results suggest that in order to maintain the recommended concentrations with bendiocarb, a second spray cycle should be carried out after three months.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000883","authors":["Narjis G Thawer","Jeremiah M Ngondi","Frances E Mugalura","Isaac Emmanuel","Charles D Mwalimu","Evangelia Morou","John Vontas","Natacha Protopopoff","Mark Rowland","Joshua Mutagahywa","Shabbir Lalji","Fabrizio Molteni","Mahdi M Ramsan","Ritha Willilo","Alexandra Wright","Jessica M Kafuko","Isaiah Ndong","Richard Reithinger","Stephen M Magesa","Stephen Masingili Magesa"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13071-015-0859-5","first_seen_on":"2015-05-01T07:30:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1756-3305"],"issue":"1","journal":"Parasites & Vectors","last_mentioned_on":1483228800,"links":["http:\/\/www.parasitesandvectors.com\/content\/8\/1\/242\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25896604?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25896604?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/s13071-015-0859-5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.parasitesandvectors.com\/content\/pdf\/s13071-015-0859-5.pdf","pmid":"25896604","pubdate":"2015-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Entomology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tropical Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"242","subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Use of insecticide quantification kits to investigate the quality of spraying and decay rate of bendiocarb on different wall surfaces in Kagera region, Tanzania.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/insecticide-quantification-kits-investigate-quality-spraying-decay-rate-bendiocarb-different-wall-su"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.6,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317260,"mean":7.0084431904706,"rank":1498843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6813751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317260,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207197,"mean":9.0350634664763,"rank":46487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":160496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207197,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2305,"mean":3.7385538194444,"rank":303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":2001,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2305,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":2.5951428571429,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
