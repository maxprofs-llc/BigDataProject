Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, modulates inflammation and apoptosis in response to oxidative stress. SIRT1, which is regulated by p53 and microRNA-34a (miR-34a), can modulate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, fibrosis and cirrhosis. Since carbon monoxide (CO) inhalation can protect against hepatic I\/R, we hypothesized that CO could ameliorate hepatic I\/R injury by regulating the miR-34a\/SIRT1 pathway. Livers from mice pretreated with CO, or PFT, a p53 inhibitor, displayed reduced production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-\u03b1, iNOS, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1\u03b2 after hepatic I\/R injury. SIRT1 expression was increased by CO or PFT in the liver after I\/R, whereas acetylated p65, p53 levels, and miR-34a expression were decreased. CO increased SIRT1 expression by inhibiting miR-34a. Both CO and PFT diminished pro-inflammatory cytokines production in vitro. Knockdown of SIRT1 in LPS-stimulated macrophages increased NF-\u03baB acetylation, and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines. CO treatment reduced miR-34a expression and increased SIRT1 expression in oxidant-challenged hepatocytes; and rescued SIRT1 expression in p53-expressing or miR-34a transfected cells. In response to CO, enhanced SIRT1 expression mediated by miR-34a inhibition protects against liver damage through p65\/p53 deacetylation, which may mediate inflammatory responses and hepatocellular apoptosis. The miR-34a\/SIRT1 pathway may represent a therapeutic target for hepatic injury.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["Kim, Hyo Jeong","Joe, Yeonsoo","Yu, Jae Kyoung","Chen, Yinqing","Jeong, Sun Oh","Mani, Nithya","Cho, Gyeong Jae","Pae, Hyun-Ock","Ryter, Stefan W","Chung, Hun Taeg"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbadis.2015.04.017","first_seen_on":"2015-04-30T00:01:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0006-3002"],"journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1430352011,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25916635?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25916635","pubdate":"2015-04-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Carbon monoxide protects against hepatic ischemia\/reperfusion injury by modulating the miR-34a\/SIRT1 pathway.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carbon-monoxide-protects-against-hepatic-ischemiareperfusion-injury-modulating-mir34asirt1-pathway"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038209,"mean":5.9746183047646,"rank":4191317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038209,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156139,"mean":9.6608853450155,"rank":130348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156139,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4535,"mean":2.7074014115571,"rank":3798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4535,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160,"mean":1.8613710691824,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
