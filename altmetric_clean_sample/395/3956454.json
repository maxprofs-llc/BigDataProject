They cause a broad spectrum of infectious diseases in various hosts, including hospital-associated infections. In recent years, the rise of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli in companion animals (dogs, cats and horses) has been striking. However, reports on nosocomial infections are mostly anecdotic. Here we report on the suspected nosocomial spread of both ESBL-producing and non-ESBL-producing multi-drug resistant E. coli isolates in three equine patients within an equine clinic. Unlike easy-to-clean hospitalization opportunities available for small animal settings like boxes and cages made of ceramic floor tiles or stainless steel, clinical settings for horses are challenging environments for infection control programs due to unavoidable extraneous material including at least hay and materials used for horse bedding. The development of practice-orientated recommendations is needed to improve the possibilities for infection control to prevent nosocomial infections with multi-drug resistant and other transmissible pathogens in equine clinical settings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9193cf058f61000d276","authors":["Walther, Birgit","L\u00fcbke-Becker, Antina","Stamm, Ivonne","Gehlen, Heidrun","Barton, Ann Kristin","Janssen, Traute","Wieler, Lothar H","Guenther, Sebastian"],"first_seen_on":"2015-04-30T09:07:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0005-9366"],"issue":"11-12","journal":"Berliner und M\u00fcnchener tier\u00e4rztliche Wochenschrift","last_mentioned_on":1430477466,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25872251?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25872251","pubdate":"2014-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Suspected nosocomial infections with multi-drug resistant E. coli, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains, in an equine clinic.","type":"article","volume":"127","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/suspected-nosocomial-infections-multidrug-resistant-e-coli-including-extendedspectrum-betalactamase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5044953,"mean":5.9751374954631,"rank":3540568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":848797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5044953,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156256,"mean":9.6564382451763,"rank":113273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":25801,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156256,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":1.6941666666667,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
