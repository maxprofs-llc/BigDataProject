The presence of gaps between knowledge and practice is well documented and a range of strategies is available to overcome these gaps. To optimize their impact, it is recommended that implementation strategies are tailored to the target population, setting and goals for improvement. Themes for future research in the field are: implementation of personalized medicine, the economics of implementation, knowledge implementation in various health professions, patient involvement in implementation, and a better understanding of the determinants of implementation. Addressing these challenges requires dedicated training programs, research funding, and networks for effective collaboration with stakeholders in healthcare.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d61","authors":["Wensing, Michel"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.zefq.2015.02.014","first_seen_on":"2015-04-30T07:41:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["18659217","2212-0289"],"issue":"2","journal":"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Evidenz, Fortbildung und Qualit\u00e4t im Gesundheitswesen","last_mentioned_on":1430379621,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1865921715000495"],"pmid":"26028446","pubdate":"2015-06-02T22:03:14+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Implementation science in healthcare: an introduction and perspective ","type":"article","volume":"109","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/implementation-science-healthcare-introduction-perspective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5042235,"mean":5.975453691361,"rank":3539059,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":847841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5042235,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156207,"mean":9.6584889312832,"rank":113245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":25791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156207,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173,"mean":1.4102674418605,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.4681818181818,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
