Field dependence\/independence is one of the most studied cognitive styles. Field independent subjects are characterized by having less difficulty in separating information from its contextual surroundings and being less likely to be influenced by external cues than field dependent individuals. The present work aimed at studying the influence of field dependence\/independence cognitive style on consumers' visual processing and choice of yogurt labels. One hundred and thirty three consumers completed a choice conjoint task. They were asked to select their preferred yogurt label from each of 16 pairs of labels. While they completed the task their eye movements were recorded using an eye-tracker. Then, consumers were asked to complete the Group Embedded Figure Test to determine their cognitive style. Consumers were divided into two groups with different cognitive styles: 58% of the sample was characterized as field dependent and 42% as field independent. When making their choices, field dependent consumers tended to engage in less thoughtful information processing than field independent consumers and they made fewer fixations on traditional nutritional information. Besides, cognitive style significantly affected the relative importance of fat and sugar content on consumer choices and modulated the influence of the traffic light system. Field dependent consumers gave less importance to the nutritional composition of the yogurts than field independent consumers for selecting their preferred label. Results from this work suggest that studying the psychological underpinnings of consumers' decision making process when selecting food products has a great potential to contribute to a better understanding of how eating patterns and consumer preferences are shaped.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028fa","authors":["Mawad, Franco","Tr\u00edas, Marcela","Gim\u00e9nez, Ana","Maiche, Alejandro","Ares, Gast\u00f3n"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.foodres.2015.04.023","first_seen_on":"2015-04-28T16:30:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09639969","1873-7145"],"journal":"Food Research International","last_mentioned_on":1430238608,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0963996915001866"],"pmid":"28411972","pubdate":"2017-04-18T22:06:37+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Influence of cognitive style on information processing and selection of yogurt labels: Insights from an eye-tracking study ","type":"article","volume":"74","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-cognitive-style-information-processing-selection-yogurt-labels-insights-eyetracking-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5033000,"mean":5.9701003787223,"rank":3532464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":846162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5033000,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155866,"mean":9.6504247136947,"rank":112866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":25889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155866,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":440,"mean":5.4443280182232,"rank":294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":440,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":30.118,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
