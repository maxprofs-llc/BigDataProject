On Gurwitsch's account, as we develop it, the field of consciousness has a variable sized focus or \"theme\" of attention surrounded by a structured periphery of inattentional contents. As the field evolves, its contents change their status, sometimes smoothly, sometimes abruptly. Inner thoughts, a sense of one's body, and the physical environment are dominant field contents. These ideas can be linked with (and help unify) contemporary theories about the neural correlates of consciousness, inattention, the small world structure of the brain, meta-stable dynamics, embodied cognition, and predictive coding in the brain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000378d","authors":["Yoshimi, Jeff","Vinson, David W"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.concog.2015.03.017","first_seen_on":"2015-04-28T17:41:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["10538100","1090-2376"],"journal":"Consciousness & Cognition","last_mentioned_on":1430302687,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1053810015000768","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25916764?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25916764","pubdate":"2015-04-29T22:03:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","psychology"],"title":"Extending Gurwitsch's field theory of consciousness.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extending-gurwitschs-field-theory-consciousness"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038209,"mean":5.9746183047646,"rank":2074150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2882303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038209,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155937,"mean":9.6497670582805,"rank":66048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":86753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155937,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":747,"mean":11.645836461126,"rank":450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":747,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":18.008,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
