First stage, 200 BA cases who underwent Kasai's operation at our institution between May 2006 and May 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. In the first stage, we wanted to calculate a clinical scoring system by logistic regression. For cut-off determination, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was employed. Second stage (validation of scoring system), we used our scoring system to prospectively predict the outcomes of patients underwent a Kasai operation from inspecting the accuracy of our system.\nEarly cholangitis, age at operation, JC time, post-operative TB, DB, AST, ALT and surgical method entered into our scoring system. The most reliable cut-offs determined by ROC analysis were 7.71 (sensitivity: 86.0\u00a0%, specificity: 98.0\u00a0%). We used our scoring system to predict the prognosis of the 15 BA patients and found that 13 of 15 patients were correctly predicted at the cut-off value of 7.71.\nOur scoring system is considered to be a reliable and useful predictor of the prognosis of biliary atresia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032b5","authors":["Zhen, Chen","Guoliang, Qiao","Lishuang, Ma","Zhen, Zhang","Chen, Wang","Jun, Zhang","Shuli, Liu","Kaoping, Guan","Chao, Liu","Xuan, Yang","Long, Li"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00383-015-3710-3","first_seen_on":"2015-04-29T23:20:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1437-9813"],"journal":"Pediatric Surgery International","last_mentioned_on":1455189519,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25895075\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25895075?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25895075","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatric Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pediatrics"],"title":"Design and validation of an early scoring system for predicting early outcomes of type III biliary atresia after Kasai's operation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/design-validation-early-scoring-system-predicting-early-outcomes-type-iii-biliary-atresia-after-kasa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7182236,"mean":6.3148176187464,"rank":3192543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3828773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7182236,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201710,"mean":8.7778353568756,"rank":91454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":103246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201710,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":476,"mean":2.0370652631579,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":476,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
