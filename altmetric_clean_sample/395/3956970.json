Parents of one hundred and thirty-eight 3- to 5-year-old children were asked to complete one survey daily for 2\u00a0weeks (N\u00a0=\u00a01,592\u00a0days). On days when fathers perceived discrimination, fathers and mothers reported more externalizing child behaviors, and mothers reported fewer positive child behaviors. When mothers perceived discrimination, they reported more externalizing child behaviors; fathers reported more internalizing child behaviors. Parents reported worse mood on days with perceived discrimination. Perceived discrimination was not strongly related to parent-child interactions. For fathers, but less so for mothers, those whose psychological acculturation indicated separation had more negative relations between daily perceived workplace discrimination and child and family outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4c93cf058f61000013c","authors":["Gassman\u2010Pines, Anna","Gassman-Pines, Anna","Anna Gassman-Pines"],"doi":"10.1111\/cdev.12378","endpage":"1190","first_seen_on":"2015-04-30T12:28:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1467-8624","00093920"],"issue":"4","journal":"Child Development","last_mentioned_on":1467592130,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cdev.12378\/abstract;jsessionid=20A55B11EDF284D576B1742EB616B680.f01t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/cdev.12378&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/cdev.12378","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cdev.12378\/abstract?platform=hootsuite","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/cdev.12378"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cdev.12378\/pdf","pmid":"25930210","pubdate":"2015-04-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1175","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Effects of Mexican Immigrant Parents\u2019 Daily Workplace Discrimination on Child Behavior and Family Functioning","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/cdev.12378","volume":"86","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-mexican-immigrant-parents-daily-workplace-discrimination-child-behavior-family-functioning"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7987814,"mean":6.7359164730015,"rank":3257378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4686971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7987814,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":205754,"mean":8.897991659903,"rank":76748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":127356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":205754,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2564,"mean":12.689111978151,"rank":1983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":566,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2564,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":24.1516,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
