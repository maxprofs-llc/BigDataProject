Three themes emerged are as follows: (1) women's desire to participate in shared decision-making, (2) the degree to which shared decision-making is perceived to be shared and (3) to what extent are women empowered within shared decision-making. Studying breast cancer patients' subjective experiences of adjuvant treatment decision-making provides a broader perspective on patient participatory role preferences and doctor-patient power dynamics within shared decision-making for breast cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd2","authors":["Neda Mahmoodi","Sally Sargeant","Mahmoodi, N","Sargeant, S"],"doi":"10.1177\/1359105316689141","first_seen_on":"2017-01-23T07:19:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1359-1053","1461-7277"],"journal":"Journal of Health Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1488525576,"links":["http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/1359105316689141","http:\/\/eprints.leedsbeckett.ac.uk\/3463\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/1359105316689141"],"pmid":"28810390","pubdate":"2017-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"135910531668914","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Shared decision-making \u2013 Rhetoric and reality: Women\u2019s experiences and perceptions of adjuvant treatment decision-making for breast cancer","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/1359105316689141","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shared-decisionmaking-rhetoric-reality-womens-experiences-perceptions-adjuvant-treatment-decisionmak"},"altmetric_score":{"score":25.8,"score_history":{"1y":25.8,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":25.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":342264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7959631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274674,"mean":12.57633372046,"rank":20487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":254165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274674,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1334,"mean":7.7781080270068,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1334,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":16.062212765957,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
