We daily used routine Doppler ultrasound during admission for early detection of graft hepatic vessel lesions, including hepatic artery and vein lesions. In outpatients, Doppler ultrasound was performed every month. Urokinase was delivered with a dose of 150,000-300,000 IU by catheter before PTA for thrombotic total occlusion of the graft for hepatic artery patients. Laboratory data were collected to evaluate the effects of the PTA procedure.\nThe study involved a total of seven patients, six of whom were successfully treated by a first PTA procedure. Thrombolysis use of urokinase in totally occluded donor hepatic arteries post-LT following stenting was successful in three patients. One complication occurred, an arterial dissection and perforation, finalizing the success rate at ~86% and the complication rate at ~14%. Therefore, our study has a primary patency rate of 100% at 1 and 3 months. Also, the graft survival rate was 100 % and 86 % in the first and third months, respectively.\nPTA with stenting is an effective treatment for hepatic vessel stenosis, including hepatic arteries and hepatic veins, after a liver transplantation without an increase in the complication rate. In addition, thrombolysis using urokinase intra-artery infusion in graft thrombotic total occluded patients is a good treatment strategy as well.\nAngioplasty; Complication; Liver transplantation.","authors":["Luo, Ming-Yuan","Wu, Yi-Ju","Lin, Tung-Chao","Shen, Thau-Yun","Yang, Ho-Pang","Chen, Chien-Cheng","Chen, Fu-Chung"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-29T14:51:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1011-6842"],"issue":"2","journal":"Zhonghua Minguo xin zang xue hui za zhi = Acta Cardiologica Sinica","last_mentioned_on":1461939440,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27122863?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27122863","pubdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty and Stenting for Hepatic Vessel Stenosis after Orthotopic Liver Transplantation.","type":"article","volume":"31"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/726052752489517056","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7078397],"posted_on":"2016-04-29T14:17:20+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"726052752489517056"}]}}
