We employed a computer-assisted navigation system to preserve the inferior gluteal artery at the sciatic notch with visualization of the inferior gluteal artery at the sciatic notch, thus maintaining blood flow to the gluteus maximus.\nWe present the results of seven patients (five men and two women) with a mean age of 64.8 years (58.4-78.8) in whom computer-assisted navigation surgery had been carried out for pelvic and sacral tumor resections.\nPostoperative enhanced computed tomography (CT) confirmed the preservation of the inferior gluteal artery in all cases. At a mean follow-up of 21.3 months (3-39), the total postoperative complication rate was 25% (n\u2009=\u20092), including hematoma (n\u2009=\u20091) and wound necrosis (n\u2009=\u20091). There were no cases of deep infection.\nThis new application of computer-assisted navigation to pelvic and sacral tumor resection can contribute to reducing postoperative complications related to insufficient flap perfusion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6123cf058f610006f9b","authors":["Toru Akiyama"],"doi":"10.3109\/24699322.2016.1174305","endpage":"24","first_seen_on":"2016-04-29T14:58:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2469-9322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Computer Aided Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1464858094,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.3109\/24699322.2016.1174305","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.3109\/24699322.2016.1174305?hootPostID=c8c239074362125a11831452d34d5e82","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.3109\/24699322.2016.1174305?hootPostID=8df41f4e8cdfadb2562be57b2d1562d3"],"pmid":"27973956","pubdate":"2016-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"18","title":"Inferior gluteal artery detection at the greater sciatic notch with a computer-assisted navigation system during pelvic and sacral tumor resection","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inferior-gluteal-artery-detection-greater-sciatic-notch-computerassisted-navigation-system-during-pe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":5672793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1895182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268244,"mean":11.419205496508,"rank":171976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":80603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268244,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":2.2166666666667,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.91666666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Other":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tandfmedicine\/statuses\/726056261633060865","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7078565],"posted_on":"2016-04-29T14:31:16+00:00","author":{"name":"T&F Medicine","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/891988471153405954\/INQG-y2l_normal.jpg","description":"Keep up to date with all the latest news and content from Taylor & Francis Medicine & Health Science journals.","id_on_source":"tandfmedicine","tweeter_id":"209246840","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":1032},"tweet_id":"726056261633060865"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tandfmedicine\/statuses\/738294445272096769","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7078565],"posted_on":"2016-06-02T09:01:27+00:00","author":{"name":"T&F Medicine","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/891988471153405954\/INQG-y2l_normal.jpg","description":"Keep up to date with all the latest news and content from Taylor & Francis Medicine & Health Science journals.","id_on_source":"tandfmedicine","tweeter_id":"209246840","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":1032},"tweet_id":"738294445272096769"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Inferior gluteal artery detection at the greater sciatic notch with a...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1001924573176404&id=962143550487840","license":"public","citation_ids":[7078565,7078565],"posted_on":"2016-04-29T14:31:19+00:00","summary":"Can a new application of computer-assisted navigation to pelvic tumor resection help insufficient flap perfusion?
