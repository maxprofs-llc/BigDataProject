It can also occur following dislocation of hip replacement. The incidence of sciatic nerve palsy in dislocated hip replacement is <0.1%. However, new onset sciatic nerve palsy following a closed reduction of dislocated hip replacement is even rarer. We describe a case of sciatic nerve palsy from traction injury following closed reduction of a total hip replacement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc98","authors":["Jimmy Ng","Ben Arthur Marson","Alan Broodryk"],"doi":"10.1136\/bcr-2016-215010","first_seen_on":"2016-04-29T14:44:22+00:00","issns":["1757-790X"],"journal":"BMJ Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1461938717,"links":["http:\/\/casereports.bmj.com\/content\/2016\/bcr-2016-215010.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/casereports.bmj.com\/content\/2016\/bcr-2016-215010.full.pdf","pmid":"27005799","pubdate":"2016-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","startpage":"bcr2016215010","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Foot drop following closed reduction of a total hip replacement","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/foot-drop-following-closed-reduction-total-hip-replacement-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7625034,"mean":6.5623772256419,"rank":5769049,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1024944,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7625034,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266764,"mean":11.394571975873,"rank":186888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266764,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2912,"mean":4.5358550326348,"rank":1707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2912,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":6.2348936170213,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
