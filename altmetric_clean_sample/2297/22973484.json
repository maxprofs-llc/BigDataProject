Here we use expressions from Debye-H\u00fcckel theory to describe the interactions between charged amino-acids in combination with our recently developed non-standard nucleation theory to predict the concentration dependence of the fibril nucleation rate under different solvent conditions. The general rule that emerges from these considerations is that changes in solution pH, salt concentration and solvent that increase the bonding energy between the fibril building blocks decrease the fibril solubility and promote fibril nucleation, in line with experimental observations. The simple analytical relations between the nucleation rate, the fibrils solubility and the binding energies provide a tool to control and understand amyloid fibril formation by changing the solution conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec5","authors":["Stefan Auer"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpcb.7b05400","first_seen_on":"2017-07-28T17:05:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-6106","1520-5207"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry B","last_mentioned_on":1501261538,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jpcb.7b05400"],"pmid":"28707467","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Simple Model of the Effect of Solution Conditions on the Nucleation of Amyloid Fibrils","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simple-model-effect-solution-conditions-nucleation-amyloid-fibrils"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8286129,"mean":6.9859106255593,"rank":7165376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8286129,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170554,"mean":11.55104804958,"rank":139285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170554,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4028,"mean":1.7548060591011,"rank":2606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4028,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":1.5169491525424,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
