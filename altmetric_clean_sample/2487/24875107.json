A look at avibactam and relebactam potential for AmpC induction \ud83d\udcf2 #Derepressedmutants"],"citation":{"abstract":"Diazabicyclooctanes, e.g. avibactam and relebactam, are a new class of \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors. Their spectrum includes AmpC enzymes, but it is important to understand whether they also induce these enzymes.\nLevels of ampC mRNA were measured by RT-PCR during 4\u2009h of exposure of Enterobacter cloacae , Citrobacter freundii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( n\u2009 = \u2009 5 strains per species) to avibactam, relebactam and cefoxitin at 0, 1, 4 and 32\u2009mg\/L. The method had low precision compared with conventional specific-activity-based induction assays, which are impracticable for inhibitors. Accordingly, induction was only considered to be significant if induction ratios >10 were found at two consecutive time intervals, with 'strong induction' if one or more of these ratios was >100.\nCefoxitin, as expected, gave concentration-dependent induction for all strains, with strong induction for 13\/15. At the other extreme, relebactam caused no significant induction for any strain. Avibactam gave strain-variable results, with strong concentration-dependent induction for 2\/5 E. cloacae and 2\/5 P. aeruginosa , but little or no induction for the other strains, including all the C. freundii strains.\nAvibactam, but not relebactam, had some strain-variable ability to induce AmpC enzymes, though at concentrations (32 mg\/L) above those reached in the patient.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c89","authors":["Livermore, David M.","Jamrozy, Dorota","Mushtaq, Shazad","Nichols, Wright W.","Young, Katherine","Woodford, Neil","David M.
