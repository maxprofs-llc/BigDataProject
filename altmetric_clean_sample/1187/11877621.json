Although Xcc has a complex fatty acid profile comprised of straight-chain fatty acids and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs), and encodes a complete set of genes required for fatty acid synthesis, there is still little known about the mechanism of BCFA synthesis. We reported that expression of Xcc fabH restores the growth of Ralstonia solanacearum fabH mutant, and this allows the R. solanacearum fabH mutant to produce BCFAs. Using in vitro assays, we demonstrated that Xcc FabH is able to condense branched-chain acyl-CoAs with malonyl-ACP to initiate BCFA synthesis. Moreover, although the fabH gene is essential for growth of Xcc, it can be replaced with Escherichia coli fabH, and Xcc mutants failed to produce BCFAs. These results suggest that Xcc does not have an obligatory requirement for BCFAs. Furthermore, Xcc mutants lost the ability to produce cis-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid, a diffusible signal factor (DSF) required for quorum sensing of Xcc, which confirms that the fatty acid synthetic pathway supplies the intermediates for DSF signal biosynthesis. Our study also showed that replacing Xcc fabH with E. coli fabH affected Xcc pathogenesis in host plants.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Yu, Yong-Hong","Hu, Zhe","Dong, Hui-Juan","Ma, Jin-Cheng","Wang, Hai-Hong"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep32811","first_seen_on":"2016-09-07T10:21:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1473243456,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27595587?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27595587","pubdate":"2016-09-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Enzyme mechanisms","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Bacterial genes","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Molecular biology","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"32811","subjects":["science"],"title":"Xanthomonas campestris FabH is required for branched-chain fatty acid and DSF-family quorum sensing signal biosynthesis","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/xanthomonas-campestris-fabh-required-branchedchain-fatty-acid-dsffamily-quorum-sensing-signal-biosyn"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":7212992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252570,"mean":12.454790849233,"rank":210898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252570,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36631,"mean":14.716910674311,"rank":30592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36631,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3270,"mean":17.76998837565,"rank":2761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3270,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
