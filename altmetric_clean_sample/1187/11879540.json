Prenatal SSRI exposure has been associated with an increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and peripheral 5-HT is elevated in some ASD patients. Perinatal SSRI exposure in rodents has been associated with increased depression and anxiety-like behavior, decreased sociability, and impaired learning in the offspring, behaviors often seen in ASD. The present study investigated whether perinatal exposure to citalopram causes persistent neurobehavioral effects. Gravid Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to two groups and subcutaneously injected twice per day with citalopram (10mg\/kg; Cit) or saline (Sal) 6h apart on embryonic day (E)6-21, and then drug was given directly to the pups after delivery from postnatal day (P)1-20. Starting on P60, one male\/female from each litter was tested in the Cincinnati water maze (CWM) and open-field before and after MK-801. A second pair from each litter was tested in the Morris water maze (MWM) and open-field before and after (+)-amphetamine. A third pair was tested as follows: elevated zero-maze, open-field, marble burying, prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle, social preference, and forced swim. Cit exposed rats were impaired in the MWM during acquisition and probe, but not during reversal, shift or cued trials. Cit exposed rats also showed increased marble burying, decreased time in the center of the open-field, decreased latency to immobility in forced swim, and increased acoustic startle across prepulse intensities with no effects on CWM. The results are consistent with citalopram inducing several ASD-like effects. The findings add to concerns about use of SSRIs during pregnancy. Further research on different classes of antidepressants, dose-effect relationships, timing of exposure periods, and mechanisms for these effects are needed. It is also important to balance the effects described here against the effects of the disorders for which the drugs are given.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b3f","authors":["Sprowles, Jenna L N","Hufgard, Jillian R","Gutierrez, Arnold","Bailey, Rebecca A","Jablonski, Sarah A","Williams, Michael T","Vorhees, Charles V"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijdevneu.2016.08.007","first_seen_on":"2016-09-07T12:13:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-474X"],"journal":"International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1473258305,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27591973?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27591973?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27591973","pubdate":"2016-09-07T22:17:03+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Perinatal Exposure to the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Citalopram Alters Spatial Learning and Memory, Anxiety, Depression, and Startle in Sprague-Dawley Rats.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/perinatal-exposure-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-citalopram-alters-spatial-learning-memory"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":6331034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1129852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252570,"mean":12.454570117472,"rank":178523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":41735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252570,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":445,"mean":2.1062747747748,"rank":268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":445,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.4333333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
