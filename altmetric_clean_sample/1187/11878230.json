In addition to the development of new antibiotics, there is an urgent need for in-depth characterization of the mechanisms of bacterial resistance toward new drugs. Here, we used essential oils extracted in our laboratory from Piper cubeba against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300, one of the most prominent antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Effects of the essential oils extracted from P\u00a0cubeba on bacteria were mainly evaluated using 2 powerful microscopy techniques: atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. High-resolution atomic force microscopy images of the cells were obtained close to their native environment by immobilizing the cells on porous Polyether sulfone membranes, which were prepared in our laboratory with a wide range and distribution of pore sizes and depth. Inhibition zones (mm) and minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined. Two different concentrations of the oil were used to treat the cells: 50\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL minimum inhibitory concentration and 25\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL. The 50\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL oil solution caused severe damage to the bacterial cells at microscopic levels while the 25\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL solution showed no effects compared to the control. However, at nanoscopic levels, the 25\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL oil solution caused significant changes in the cell wall, which could potentially impair bacterial activities. These results were also confirmed by transmission electron microscopy micrographs. Our results indicate that the extract has a good biological activity against methicillin- and oxacillin-resistant S\u00a0aureus and that it acts on the cell wall and plasma (cytoplasmic) membrane.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d71","authors":["Alharbi, Naiyf S","Khaled, Jamal M","Alzaharni, Khalid E","Mothana, Ramzi A","Alsaid, Mansour S","Alhoshan, Mansour","Dass, Lawrence Arockiasamy","Kadaikunnan, Shine","Alobaidi, Ahmed S"],"doi":"10.1002\/jmr.2564","first_seen_on":"2016-09-07T10:41:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1099-1352"],"journal":"Journal of Molecular Recognition","last_mentioned_on":1473327481,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27594436?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27594436","pubdate":"2016-09-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"\n              Effects of\n              Piper cubeba\n              L. essential oil on methicillin-resistant\n              Staphylococcus aureus\n              : an AFM and TEM study\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-piper-cubeba-l-essential-oil-methicillinresistant-staphylococcus-aureus-afm-tem-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8348788,"mean":7.0413328717018,"rank":3839734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4425417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8348788,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252625,"mean":12.454726423459,"rank":112134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":136146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252625,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145,"mean":1.8302361111111,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.4,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"FR":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AntibioticResis\/statuses\/773471060364636160","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11878230],"posted_on":"2016-09-07T10:40:45+00:00","author":{"name":"AntibioticResistance","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/551766191962746880\/GlO2QteM_normal.jpeg","description":"Keep abreast of the latest developments in the fight against Antibiotic Resistance #AMR with the latest publications curated from PubMed.
