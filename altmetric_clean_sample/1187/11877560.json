Conversely, high-molecular-weight hyaluronan, typical of un-inflamed tissues, is known to suppress inflammation.\nWe asked whether HMW-HA can be adapted to adapted to promote tolerance to airway allergens.\nHMW-HA was thiolated to prevent its catabolism and tethered it to allergens via thiol linkages. This platform, which we call \"XHA\", delivers antigenic payloads in the context of anti-inflammatory co-stimulation. Allergen\/XHA was administered intra-nasally to mice that were previously sensitized to those allergens.\nXHA prevents allergic airway inflammation (AAI) in mice previously sensitized to either ovalbumin or cockroach proteins. Allergen\/XHA treatment reduced inflammatory cell counts, airway hyper-responsiveness, allergen-specific IgE, and Th2 cytokine production in comparison to animals challenged with allergen alone. These effects were allergen specific and were durable for weeks after the last challenge, providing a substantial advantage over current desensitization protocols. Mechanistically, XHA promoted CD44-dependent inhibition of NF\u03baB signaling in monocyte-derived dendritic cells and diminished dendritic cell maturation and the induction of allergen specific CD4 T-helper responses.\nXHA and potentially other strategies that target CD44 are promising alternatives for the treatment of asthma and allergic sinusitis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f61000698a","authors":["Gebe, John A","Yadava, Koshika","Ruppert, Shannon M","Marshall, Payton","Hill, Paul","Falk, Ben A","Sweere, Johanna M","Han, Hongwei","Kaber, Gernot","Medina, Carlos","Mikecz, Katalin","Ziegler, Steven F","Balaji, Swathi","Keswani, Sundeep G","de Jesus Perez, Vinicio A","Butte, Manish J","Nadeau, Kari","Altemeier, William A","Fanger, Neil","Bollyky, Paul L","John A.
