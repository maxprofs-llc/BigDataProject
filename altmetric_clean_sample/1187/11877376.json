For purpose of study, we compared effects of ramipril on cardiac dysfunction, cardiac failure markers and PPAR isoforms in moderate and severe chronic daunorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. Male Wistar rats were administered with a single intravenous injection of daunorubicin: 5 mg\/kg (moderate cardiomyopathy), or 15 mg\/kg (severe cardiomyopathy) or co-administered with daunorubicin and ramipril (1 mg\/kg\/d, orally) or vehicle for 8 weeks. Left ventricular function was measured invasively under anesthesia. Cardiac mRNA levels of heart failure markers (ANP, Myh6, Myh7, Myh7b) and PPARs (alpha, beta\/delta and gama) were measured by qRT-PCR. Protein expression of NADPH subunit (gp91phox) was measured by Western blot. Moderate cardiomyopathy exhibited only minor cardiac dysfunction what was corrected by ramipril. In severe cardiomyopathy, hemodynamic dysfunction remained unaltered upon ramipril although it decreased the significantly up-regulated cardiac ANP mRNA expression. Simultaneously, while high-dose daunorubicin significantly decreased PPARbeta\/delta and PPARgama mRNA, ramipril normalized these abnormalities. Similarly, ramipril reduced altered levels of oxidative stress-related gp91phox. On the other hand, ramipril was unable to correct both the significantly decreased relative abundance of Myh6 and increased Myh7 mRNA levels, respectively. In conclusion, ramipril had a protective effect on cardiac function exclusively in moderate chronic daunorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. Although it normalized abnormal PPARs expression and exerted also additional protective effects also in severe cardiomyopathy, it was insufficient to influence impaired cardiac function probably because of a shift in myosin heavy chain isoform content.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000284e","authors":["Cernecka, Hana","Doka, Gabriel","Srankova, Jasna","Pivackova, Lenka","Malikova, Eva","Galkova, Kristina","Kyselovic, Jan","Krenek, Peter","Klimas, Jan","Hana Cernecka","Gabriel Doka","Jasna Srankova","Lenka Pivackova","Eva Malikova","Kristina Galkova","Jan Kyselovic","Peter Krenek","Jan Klimas"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejphar.2016.08.040","endpage":"253","first_seen_on":"2016-09-07T10:17:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0712","00142999"],"journal":"European Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1490868318,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27592051?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0014299916305593&_version=1&md5=4ae3810f7947b9be71a5eaa247926371","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27592051?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27592051","pubdate":"2016-09-07T22:16:52+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"244","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Ramipril restores PPAR\u03b2\/\u03b4 and PPAR\u03b3 expressions and reduces cardiac NADPH oxidase but fails to restore cardiac function and accompanied myosin heavy chain ratio shift in severe anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy in rat.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0014299916305593","volume":"791","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ramipril-restores-ppar-ppar-expressions-reduces-cardiac-nadph-oxidase-fails-restore-cardiac-function"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":7289357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253416,"mean":12.488530205394,"rank":209870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253416,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2557,"mean":2.8818959311424,"rank":2031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2557,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.71825,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/773462005864886273","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11877376],"posted_on":"2016-09-07T10:04:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
