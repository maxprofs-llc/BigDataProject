Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VDR may influence the function of vitamin D and susceptibility to tuberculosis.\nThis study included 217 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and 383 healthy subjects in a Tibetan Chinese population living in and near Xi'an. Association analyses of SNPs in VDR were performed with the SPSS 17.0 statistical packages, SNP stats software, Haploview software package (version 4.2), and the SHEsis software platform.\nOur results revealed a correlation between three SNPs (rs11574143, odds ratio [OR]: 1.47, 95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11 - 1.94, p\u2009=\u20090.006, p-adjust\u2009=\u20090.030; rs11574079, OR: 0.48, 95\u00a0% CI: 0.25 - 0.92, p\u2009=\u20090.023, p-adjust\u2009=\u20090.115; rs11168287, OR: 2.55, 95\u00a0% CI: 2.00 - 3.25, p\u2009=\u20091.730E-14, p-adjust\u2009=\u20090.865E-13) and PTB based on Chi-square tests. We observed the allele \"A\" of rs11574143 and rs11168287 increased the PTB risk and the allele \"A\" of rs11574079 provided a protective effect against PTB.\nThe goal of this study was the identification of putative associations between five SNPs (rs11574143, rs7975232, rs11574079, rs3819545 and rs11168287) in VDR and susceptibility to PTB. Our findings demonstrated associations between VDR polymorphisms and PTB development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","authors":["Hu, Qunying","Chen, Zhengshuai","Liang, Guinian","Mo, Fangping","Zhang, Hengxun","Xu, Shilin","Wang, Yuhe","Kang, Longli","Jin, Tianbo","Qunying Hu","Zhengshuai Chen","Guinian Liang","Fangping Mo","Hengxun Zhang","Shilin Xu","Yuhe Wang","Longli Kang","Tianbo Jin"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12879-016-1699-4","first_seen_on":"2016-09-07T11:05:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2334"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1473648962,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27595605?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12879-016-1699-4"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12879-016-1699-4?site=bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"27595605","pubdate":"2016-09-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tropical Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"469","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Vitamin D receptor gene associations with pulmonary tuberculosis in a Tibetan Chinese population","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitamin-d-receptor-gene-associations-pulmonary-tuberculosis-tibetan-chinese-population"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":7232004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252771,"mean":12.458918099458,"rank":210552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252771,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3732,"mean":3.9636403109086,"rank":3367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3732,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200,"mean":3.4978190954774,"rank":153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Chemistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"VE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BIOCIENCIA2013\/statuses\/775166049520062464","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11878589],"posted_on":"2016-09-12T02:56:02+00:00","author":{"name":"BIOCIENCIA","url":"http:\/\/musical100fm.com.ve\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000300217090\/9b25d5f581a95fff46afd4d8d0d0aad0_normal.jpeg","description":"Programa radial de enfermedades, avances tecnol\u00f3gicos, eventos cient\u00edficos de inter\u00e9s, noticias, entrevistas","id_on_source":"BIOCIENCIA2013","tweeter_id":"1672141952","geo":{"lt":10.46354,"ln":-64.1775,"country":"VE"},"followers":898},"tweet_id":"775166049520062464"}]}}
