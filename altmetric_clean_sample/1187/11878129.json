Alkali salts impose ionic, osmotic, and high pH stresses on plants. The alkali tolerance molecular mechanism in roots from halophyte Puccinellia tenuiflora is still unclear. Here, the changes associated with Na2CO3 tolerance in P. tenuiflora roots were assessed using physiological and iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analyses. We set up the first protein dataset in P. tenuiflora roots containing 2,671 non-redundant proteins. Our results showed that Na2CO3 slightly inhibited root growth, caused ROS accumulation, cell membrane damage, and ion imbalance, as well as reduction of transport and protein synthesis\/turnover. The Na2CO3-responsive patterns of 72 proteins highlighted specific signaling and metabolic pathways in roots. Ca(2+) signaling was activated to transmit alkali stress signals as inferred by the accumulation of calcium-binding proteins. Additionally, the activities of peroxidase and glutathione peroxidase, and the peroxiredoxin abundance were increased for ROS scavenging. Furthermore, ion toxicity was relieved through Na(+) influx restriction and compartmentalization, and osmotic homeostasis reestablishment due to glycine betaine accumulation. Importantly, two transcription factors were increased for regulating specific alkali-responsive gene expression. Carbohydrate metabolism-related enzymes were increased for providing energy and carbon skeletons for cellular metabolism. All these provide new insights into alkali-tolerant mechanisms in roots.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Zhao, Qi","Suo, Jinwei","Chen, Sixue","Jin, Yudan","Ma, Xiaolin","Yin, Zepeng","Zhang, Yuhong","Wang, Tai","Luo, Ji","Jin, Wenhai","Zhang, Xia","Zhou, Zhiqiang","Dai, Shaojun"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep32717","first_seen_on":"2016-09-07T10:34:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1473861741,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27596441?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27596441"],"pmid":"27596441","pubdate":"2016-09-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Salt","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"32717","subjects":["science"],"title":"Na2CO3-responsive mechanisms in halophyte Puccinellia tenuiflora roots revealed by physiological and proteomic analyses","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/na2co3-responsive-mechanisms-halophyte-puccinellia-tenuiflora-roots-revealed-physiological-proteomic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":6060371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2020227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252875,"mean":12.477123278787,"rank":164134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":74443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252875,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37143,"mean":14.723250659631,"rank":24909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":10339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37143,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3272,"mean":17.75646346683,"rank":2209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3272,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
