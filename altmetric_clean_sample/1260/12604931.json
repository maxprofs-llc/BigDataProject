IR is associated with reduced eNOS expression and exacerbated by superimposed stress. NOSTRIN induces intracellular endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) translocation and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) increases nitric oxide (NO) production. Our aim was to assess hepatic expression of iNOS, eNOS, and NOSTRIN in IR with or without N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or thymoquinone (TQ) pretreatment and to compare their hepatoprotective effects. Surgical induction of IR was performed by occlusion of hepatic pedicle for 30\u00a0min with mini-clamp and reperfused for 30\u00a0min. The effects of TQ (20\u00a0mg\/kg\/day) or NAC (300\u00a0mg\/kg\/day) administered orally for 10\u00a0days were evaluated by serum ALT and AST, oxidative stress parameters, NO production, and histopathological analysis. Also, localization and expression of iNOS, eNOS, and NOSTRIN were assessed by immunofluorescence. TQ or NAC pretreatment significantly decreased elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities, malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and NO production. In addition, they restored the depleted GSH content and alleviated histopathological changes. Furthermore, they up-regulated eNOS and down-regulated iNOS and NOSTRIN expressions. TQ exerts its hepatoprotective effect, at least in part, by nitric oxide signaling pathway through modulation of iNOS, eNOS, and NOSTRIN expressions as well as suppression of oxidative stress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008264","authors":["Mohamed Abd-Elbaset","El-Shaimaa A.
