The most limiting factor is that DNNs as notorious 'black boxes' do not provide insight into neurophysiological phenomena underlying a decision. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) has been introduced as a novel method to explain individual network decisions.\nWe propose the application of DNNs with LRP for the first time for EEG data analysis. Through LRP the single-trial DNN decisions are transformed into heatmaps indicating each data point's relevance for the outcome of the decision.\nDNN achieves classification accuracies comparable to those of CSP-LDA. In subjects with low performance subject-to-subject transfer of trained DNNs can improve the results. The single-trial LRP heatmaps reveal neurophysiologically plausible patterns, resembling CSP-derived scalp maps. Critically, while CSP patterns represent class-wise aggregated information, LRP heatmaps pinpoint neural patterns to single time points in single trials.\nWe compare the classification performance of DNNs to that of linear CSP-LDA on two data sets related to motor-imaginery BCI.\nWe have demonstrated that DNN is a powerful non-linear tool for EEG analysis. With LRP a new quality of high-resolution assessment of neural activity can be reached. LRP is a potential remedy for the lack of interpretability of DNNs that has limited their utility in neuroscientific applications. The extreme specificity of the LRP-derived heatmaps opens up new avenues for investigating neural activity underlying complex perception or decision-related processes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e7a","authors":["Sturm, Irene","Lapuschkin, Sebastian","Samek, Wojciech","M\u00fcller, Klaus-Robert"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jneumeth.2016.10.008","first_seen_on":"2016-10-14T07:23:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01650270","1872-678X"],"journal":"Journal of Neuroscience Methods","last_mentioned_on":1476429797,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0165027016302333"],"pmid":"27746229","pubdate":"2016-10-18T22:08:59+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Interpretable Deep Neural Networks for Single-Trial EEG Classification","type":"article","volume":"274","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interpretable-deep-neural-networks-singletrial-eeg-classification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7540906,"mean":6.5135694142772,"rank":6531884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7540906,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239519,"mean":12.43275874047,"rank":196869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239519,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":929,"mean":3.0964568965517,"rank":731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":929,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":5.259375,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
