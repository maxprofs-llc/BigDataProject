After purification, a 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed. Bicinchoninic acid was used to determine the molecular weight and concentration of AaHIV. AaHIV, venom complex (VC), and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were subsequently used to immunize the mice three times, and the blood was sampled 1 week after the third immunization to determine the serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titer. A skin-bleeding inhibition assay and toxin-eliminating assay were performed on the immunized mice. The purity and concentration of AaHIV were 86.6% and 1.20 mg\/mL, respectively. The AaHIV group exhibited higher antibody titers than the VC group. The survival rate of the AaHIV group (7\/10) was significantly higher than that of the PBS group (0\/10) (P = 0.0031). The high titer of antibodies induced by AaHIV partially neutralized the bleeding activity of the Deinagkistrodon acutus venom complex.","authors":["Zhang, Lei","Chen, Cong","Cao, Yuliang","Xie, Baifa","Chen, Xiangyu","Zeng, Fanjie","Liu, Minghua"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.foodchem.2015.07.046","endpage":"476","first_seen_on":"2016-10-13T21:42:52+00:00","issns":["1099-0461","03088146"],"issue":"9","journal":"Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1491316602,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0308814615010560"],"pmid":"27111246","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"470","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Improving the sweet aftertaste of green tea infusion with tannase","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improving-sweet-aftertaste-green-tea-infusion-tannase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.7,"score_history":{"1y":4.7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.7},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
