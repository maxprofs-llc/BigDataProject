This study sought to clarify the relationship of parental RF among mothers with eating disorder symptomatology.\nWe assessed 59 mothers for ED symptomatology using the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and RF through the Parental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (PRFQ). Bivariate and multivariate analyses compared PRFQ subscales between symptomatic and asymptomatic mothers, using a clinical cutoff score of 4 on the EDE-Q subscales.\nGreater weight and shape concerns were found to significantly predict higher RF (p=0.023; p=0.026).\nThis finding could indicate a similar pattern seen among individuals with bulimia nervosa; individuals have higher RF scores, although affect regulation may still be limited. More research is needed with a larger sample to define the relationship between ED symptomatology and RF and identify potential mediators and moderators.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002751","authors":["Claydon, Elizabeth","Zerwas, Stephanie","Callinan, Laura","Smith, Megan V"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.eatbeh.2016.09.002","endpage":"144","first_seen_on":"2016-10-13T20:02:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-7358","14710153"],"journal":"Eating Behaviors","last_mentioned_on":1477060273,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27718453","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1471015316301131"],"pmid":"27718453","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"141","subjects":["behavioralsciences","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Parental reflective functioning among mothers with eating disorder symptomatology","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parental-reflective-functioning-among-mothers-eating-disorder-symptomatology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7571218,"mean":6.5337981331095,"rank":3432837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4108286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7571218,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239936,"mean":12.442322237272,"rank":110168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":128294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239936,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":489,"mean":6.0200860655738,"rank":269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":489,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.6875,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
