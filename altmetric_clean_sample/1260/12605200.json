In this study, we conducted the selective oxidation of p-cymene (synthesized from biodegradable terpenes, limonene, or eucalyptol) into terephthalic acid over a Mn-Fe mixed-oxide heterogeneous catalyst. The impact of various process parameters (oxidant, temperature, reaction time, catalyst amount, oxygen pressure) on the selectivity to terephthalic acid was evaluated, and some mechanistic aspects were elucidated. An unprecedented synthesis of biobased terephthalic acid (51\u2009% yield) in the presence of O2 is reported.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e64","authors":["Nea\u0163u, Florentina","Culic\u0103, Geanina","Florea, Mihaela","Parvulescu, Vasile I.","Cavani, Fabrizio"],"doi":"10.1002\/cssc.201600718","first_seen_on":"2016-10-13T23:45:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1864-564X"],"journal":"ChemSusChem","last_mentioned_on":1476474163,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201600718\/abstract;jsessionid=26020C5CC55CEEE13A018956D5DD4AEB.f03t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201600718\/pdf","pmid":"27731947","pubdate":"2016-10-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Energy","Materials Science","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis of Terephthalic Acid by p-Cymene Oxidation using Oxygen: Toward a More Sustainable Production of Bio-Polyethylene Terephthalate","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-terephthalic-acid-pcymene-oxidation-using-oxygen-toward-more-sustainable-production-biopol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7540906,"mean":6.5135694142772,"rank":3417231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4093809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7540906,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239040,"mean":12.45070089818,"rank":109792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":127790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239040,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1639,"mean":2.534126984127,"rank":377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":1246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1639,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125,"mean":3.5452419354839,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
