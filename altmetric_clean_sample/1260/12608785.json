Sixty healthy sedentary males were randomly assigned to engage in either high-intensity interval training (HIIT, 3\u2009min intervals at 80% and 40% VO2max, n\u2009=\u200920) or moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT, sustained 60% VO2max, n\u2009=\u200920) for 30\u2009min\/day, 5 days\/week for 6 weeks or were assigned to a control group that did not receive exercise intervention (n\u2009=\u200920). Lymphocyte phenotypes\/mitochondrial functionality under hypoxic exercise (HE, 100\u2009W under 12% O2) were determined before and after the various interventions. Before the intervention, HE (i) increased the mobilization of senescent (CD57(+)\/CD28(-)) lymphocytes into the blood, (ii) decreased the ATP-linked O2 consumption rate (OCR), the reserve capacity of OCR, and the citrate synthase activity in the mitochondria, and (iii) lowered the mitochondrial membrane potential (MP) and elevated the matrix oxidant burden (MOB) of lymphocytes. However, both HIIT and MICT significantly (i) decreased blood senescent lymphocyte counts, (ii) enhanced the mitochondrial OCR with increased citrate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase activities, (iii) increased mitochondrial MP and decreased MOB and (iv) increased the ratio of mitofusin to DRP-1 in lymphocytes after HE. Thus, we concluded that either HIIT or MICT effectively improves lymphocyte mitochondrial functionality by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation and suppressing oxidative damage under hypoxic conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Tsai, Hsing-Hua","Chang, Shao-Chiang","Chou, Cheng-Hsien","Weng, Tzu-Pin","Hsu, Chih-Chin","Wang, Jong-Shyan"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep35170","first_seen_on":"2016-10-14T06:50:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1476427825,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27731374"],"pmid":"27731374","pubdate":"2016-10-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied immunology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Energy metabolism","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"35170","subjects":["science"],"title":"Exercise Training Alleviates Hypoxia-induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction in the Lymphocytes of Sedentary Males","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exercise-training-alleviates-hypoxiainduced-mitochondrial-dysfunction-lymphocytes-sedentary-males"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7540906,"mean":6.5135694142772,"rank":6531884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7540906,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239519,"mean":12.432766464316,"rank":196869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239519,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28987,"mean":14.727348720072,"rank":24806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28987,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2999,"mean":15.585209472982,"rank":2589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2999,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
