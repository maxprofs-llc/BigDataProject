Further, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved studies of safety and efficacy in eight anesthetized monkeys and six cats are described.\nMean arterial pressure, heart rate, twitch, and train-of-four were recorded; estimated dose producing 95% twitch inhibition (ED95) for NMB and twitch recovery intervals from 5 to 95% of baseline were derived. Antagonism of 99 to 100% block in monkeys by L-cysteine (50\u2009mg\/kg) was tested after bolus doses of approximately 3.75 to 20 \u00d7 ED95 and after infusions. Vagal and sympathetic autonomic responses were recorded in cats. Dose ratios for [circulatory (ED20) or autonomic (ED50) changes\/ED95 (NMB)] were calculated.\nED95s of CW002 in monkeys and cats were 0.040 and 0.035\u2009mg\/kg; L-cysteine readily antagonized block in monkeys: 5 to 95% twitch recovery intervals were shortened to 1.8 to 3.6\u2009min after 3.75 to 10 \u00d7 ED95 or infusions versus 11.5 to 13.5\u2009min during spontaneous recovery. ED for 20% decrease of mean arterial pressure (n = 27) was 1.06\u2009mg\/kg in monkeys; ED for 20% increase of HR (n = 27) was 2.16\u2009mg\/kg. ED50s for vagal and sympathetic inhibition in cats were 0.59 and >0.80\u2009mg\/kg (n = 14 and 15). Dose ratios for [circulatory or autonomic changes\/ED95 (NMB)] were all more than 15 \u00d7 ED95.\nThe data further verify the neuromuscular blocking properties of CW002, including rapid reversal by L-cysteine of 100% NMB under several circumstances. A notable lack of autonomic or circulatory effects provided added proof of safety and efficacy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002255","authors":["Hiroshi Sunaga","John J. Savarese","Jeff D.
