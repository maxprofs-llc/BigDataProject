We aimed to study the real-world impact of the implementation of this curriculum on handover quality, duration and identification of unstable patients.\nA prospective intervention study was conducted. We implemented the I-PASS curriculum via faculty education and resident workshops. Resident handover on the clinical teaching unit was video-recorded and written handover documents were collected for two weeks pre- and post-intervention. We examined the inclusion of key elements on handover documents pre- and post-intervention using logistic regression models accounting for multiple handovers per patient. Duration of handover was compared using a linear regression model adjusting for number of patients. Qualitative content analysis was used to describe observable differences in verbal handover recordings and written critical care consultations.\n1275 handovers were included, comprising 364 inpatients. There was a significant increase (p<0.05) in 7 of 11 key elements, and a significant decrease in written physical exam findings post-intervention. No significant change was found in handover duration. Qualitative video analysis revealed observable differences in handover collaboration and organization. Post-intervention, patients with critical care needs overnight were correctly identified as requiring close monitoring during handover.\nHandover training resulted in consistent inclusion of key elements and was characterized by collaboration between participants and improved organization, without significant increase in handover duration. Appropriate identification and response to clinically deteriorating patients was also found using the I-PASS model.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056b1","authors":["Huth, Kathleen","Hart, Francine","Moreau, Katherine","Baldwin, Katherine","Parker, Kristy","Creery, David","Aglipay, Mary","Doja, Asif","Kathleen Huth","Francine Hart","Katherine Moreau","Katherine Baldwin","Kristy Parker","David Creery","Mary Aglipay","Asif Doja"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.acap.2016.05.143","endpage":"539","first_seen_on":"2016-10-13T20:40:30+00:00","issns":["1876-2867","18762859"],"issue":"6","journal":"Academic Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1480601455,"links":["http:\/\/www.academicpedsjnl.net\/article\/S1876-2859(16)30291-1\/abstract","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.academicpedsjnl.net%2Farticle%2FS1876-2859%2816%2930291-1%2Fabstract&rc=0&code=acap-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.academicpedsjnl.net\/article\/S1876285916302911\/pdf","pmid":"27188521","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"532","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Real-World Implementation of a Standardized Handover Program (I-PASS) on a Pediatric Clinical Teaching Unit","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1876285916302911","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/realworld-implementation-standardized-handover-program-ipass-pediatric-clinical-teaching-unit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":2.35,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7831397,"mean":6.6382928244153,"rank":3186837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4602281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7831397,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243725,"mean":12.474833902283,"rank":93809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":147881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243725,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":435,"mean":11.327705069124,"rank":196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":435,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":11.229230769231,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
