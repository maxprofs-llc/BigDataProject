An efficient method for complete regioselective 5-O-opening of conformationally restricted 3,5-O-di-tert-butylsilylene-D-galactofuranoside derivatives was developed. The use of a solution nBu4NF (1.1 equiv) in CH2Cl2 on 6 gave the 5-OH free derivative 10 as the only product (90%). 3-O-Di-tert-butylhydroxysilyl derivative 10 was stable upon purification and glycosylation reaction. Preactivation of conformationally restricted thioglycoside 6 employing p-NO2-benzensulfenyl chloride\/AgOTf followed by condensation over the 5-OH thioglycoside acceptor 10 gave the corresponding disaccharide 12 without autocondensation byproduct. Regioselective 5-O-deprotection was also successfully performed over the (1->5)-beta-D-galactofuranosyl di- and trisaccharide derivatives 12 and 13. This methodology allowed the differentiation between the secondary hydroxyl groups OH-3 and OH-5 of 1,2-cis or 1,2-trans D-galactofuranoside derivatives and it still constitutes an innovative approach to access oligosaccharides of pharmacological importance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9f","authors":["Mariano J.
