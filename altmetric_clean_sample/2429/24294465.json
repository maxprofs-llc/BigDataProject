This review discusses metabolic risk factors in particular and their interaction with other maternal and\/or pregnancy characteristics. Examples of research studies that have used data from women with specific characteristics or explored the interaction between risk factors are discussed. Suggestions for future research using large data sets and incorporating knowledge of cardiovascular disease and other metabolic diseases are also highlighted.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008eed","authors":["Myers, Jenny E.","Jenny E.
