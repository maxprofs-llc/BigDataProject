Understanding the heterogeneity of these lymphocytes requires the ability to integrate their underlying phenotype with dynamic functional behaviors. We have developed and validated a single-cell methodology that integrates cellular phenotyping and dynamic cytokine secretion based on nanowell arrays and bead-based molecular biosensors. We demonstrate the robust passivation of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based nanowells arrays with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and validated our assay by comparison to enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays. We used numerical simulations to optimize the molecular density of antibodies on the surface of the beads as a function of the capture efficiency of cytokines within an open-well system. Analysis of hundreds of individual human peripheral blood NK cells profiled ex vivo revealed that CD56dimCD16+ NK cells are immediate secretors of interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) upon activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin (< 3 h), and that there was no evidence of cooperation between NK cells leading to either synergistic activation or faster IFN-\u03b3 secretion. Furthermore, we observed that both the amount and rate of IFN-\u03b3 secretion from individual NK cells were donor-dependent. Collectively, these results establish our methodology as an investigational tool for combining phenotyping and real-time protein secretion of individual cells in a high-throughput manner.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["An, Xingyue","Sendra, Victor G.","Liadi, Ivan","Ramesh, Balakrishnan","Romain, Gabrielle","Haymaker, Cara","Martinez-Paniagua, Melisa","Lu, Yanbin","Radvanyi, Laszlo G.","Roysam, Badrinath","Varadarajan, Navin","Xingyue An","Victor G.
