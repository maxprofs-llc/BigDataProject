Sequence analysis revealed a high degree of homology between putative functional domains of medaka p53 and p53 genes from other vertebrate taxa including rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), frog (Xenopus laevis), chicken (Gallus gallus), rat (Rattus norvegicus), mouse (Mus musculus), hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), green monkey (Ceropithecus aethiops) and human (Homo sapiens). A single 1.9-kb p53 mRNA is expressed at a very low level in normal adult liver tissue. This transcript is similar in size to transcripts of p53 genes from other species. Preliminary screening of six MNNG-induced tumors in four adult medaka revealed no mutations within characteristic mutational hotspots encompassing conserved domains IV and V.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002932","authors":["Krause, M K","Rhodes, L D","Van Beneden, R J","Maureen K Krause","Linda D Rhodes","Rebecca J Van Beneden"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0378-1119(96)00841-4","endpage":"106","first_seen_on":"2016-12-14T12:03:06+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0378-1119","03781119"],"issue":"1","journal":"Gene","last_mentioned_on":883612800,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0378-1119(96)00841-4"],"pmid":"9161419","pubdate":"1997-04-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"101","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Cloning of the p53 tumor suppressor gene from the Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) and evaluation of mutational hotspots in MNNG-exposed fish","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0378111996008414","volume":"189","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cloning-p53-tumor-suppressor-gene-japanese-medaka-oryzias-latipes-evaluation-mutational-hotspots-mnn"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6766814,"mean":6.1671174057849,"rank":1573092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4491475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6766814,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104658,"mean":10.873824015594,"rank":31379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":72155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104658,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3965,"mean":2.4271175580222,"rank":251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3965,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.4416666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Issues in Potable Reuse: The Viability of Augmenting Drinking Water Supplies with Reclaimed Water","url":"https:\/\/www.nap.edu\/download\/6022","license":"public","citation_ids":[14740588,9891526,14740589,3254158,14568881,14470737,14588676,2159297,14740590,14740592,3201794,14740593,14740594,14576437,14575982,3279705,14576681,14740595,14740596,14740598,14740599,14576887,14740601,14740603,14740604,14740605,14740606,14740607,10399363,14740608,14572142,14740609,14476169,14740610,14740611,14570915,14593075,14740612,14570899,14501990,14740613,14740615,14570901,14570903,101418,14571118,14740616,14740617,16589204,14740618,14569517,14740620,14740621,14740622,14740623,16659927,14740624,14740625,16659558,14570893,14740626,20493017,14740628,3391492,3382866,3284095,14740629,5900663,14740630,14740631,14570819,14740632,20493019,14595626,14740633,14740634,14740635,16659928,14740637,14740638,14740639,16659929,3387163,14740640,20493021,14740642,14740643,14740644,20493023,14740645,14740646,3306146,14511108,14740648,14740650,7161459,14313456,14965294,16659933],"posted_on":"1998-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","source":{"name":"National Academies Press","description":"The US National Academies Press (NAP) was created by the National Academy of Sciences to publish the reports of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, operating under a charter granted by the Congress of the United States.
