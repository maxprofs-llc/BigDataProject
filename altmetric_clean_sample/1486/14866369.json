Clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes were compared among adolescents (age 10-19 years), youth (20-24 years) and a systematic sample of adults (\u2a7e25 years).\nWe analyzed 120 adolescent, 210 youth, and 548 adult cases. Adolescents had twice the risk of LTFU over adults (RR 2.0, 95%CI 1.1-3.7, P = 0.03), and higher LTFU than youth; this was not significant (RR 1.4, 95%CI 0.7-2.9, P = 0.32). Of those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, 8\/35 (22.9%) adolescents were LTFU, compared with 3\/51 (5.9%) youth, and 25\/407 (6.1%) adults (P = 0.001). In a multivariable model, adolescence (OR 3.0, 95%CI 1.3-6.5, P < 0.01), HIV positivity (OR 2.2, 95%CI 1.1-4.5, P = 0.02), and extra-pulmonary TB (OR 2.2, 95%CI 1.2-4.0, P = 0.01) were each associated with LTFU.\nAdolescents treated for TB had greater LTFU than youth and adults, particularly in the setting of TB-HIV coinfection. Further work should clarify the generalizability of these findings and investigate poor outcomes among adolescents with TB.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007a18","authors":["Enane, L.
