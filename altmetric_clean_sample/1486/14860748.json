However, there is no published literature on the use of DTI in the diagnosis of biliary atresia (BA). This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of the liver average apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) measured using DTI for BA in neonates and infants.\nFifty-nine patients with infant jaundice were included in this study. DTI was performed with b factors of 0 and 1000 s\/mm2. Liver fibrosis in the BA group was determined and graded (F0, F1, F2, F3, F4) based on the pathological findings. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of DTI for BA.\nThe ADC value was significantly lower in the BA group [(1.262\u00b10.127)\u00d710-3 mm2\/s] than in the non-BA group [(1.430\u00b10.149)\u00d710-3 mm2\/s, (P<0.001)]. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.805\u00b10.058 (P<0.001) for ADC. With a cut-off value of 1.317\u00d710-3 mm2\/s, ADC achieved a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 81.5% for the differential diagnosis of BA and non-BA. In the BA group, the ADC value was significantly correlated with fibrotic stage. Further analysis showed that the ADC value of stage F0 was significantly higher than that of stages F1, F2, F3 and F4, whereas there were no significant differences among stages F1, F2, F3 and F4.\nHepatic ADC measured with DTI can be used as an adjunct to other noninvasive imaging methods in the differential diagnosis of BA and non-BA. ADC was helpful in detecting liver fibrosis but not in differentiating the fibrotic grades.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Bo Liu","Jinhua Cai","Jin Zhu","Helin Zheng","Yun Zhang","Longlun Wang"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0168477","first_seen_on":"2016-12-19T21:23:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1482182587,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0168477&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0168477&type=printable","pmcid":"PMC5167545","pmid":"27992499","pubdate":"2016-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0168477","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Diffusion Tensor Imaging for Evaluating Biliary Atresia in Infants and Neonates","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diffusion-tensor-imaging-evaluating-biliary-atresia-infants-neonates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7909849,"mean":6.6937446400934,"rank":6848516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7909849,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250611,"mean":12.388916411954,"rank":205117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250611,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111193,"mean":10.333020882798,"rank":93806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111193,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3816,"mean":12.570977195282,"rank":3019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3816,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/neuropapersbot\/statuses\/810958664148271104","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14860748],"posted_on":"2016-12-19T21:23:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Neuroscience Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"hi there, I am a twitter bot who tweets new papers in neuroscience","id_on_source":"neuropapersbot","tweeter_id":"757895584317440000","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":22},"tweet_id":"810958664148271104"}]}}
