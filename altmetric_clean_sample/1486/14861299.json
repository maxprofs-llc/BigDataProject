The main outcome measures were vertigo control and hearing preservation.\nIn patients with unilateral disease, vertigo control was obtained in 94.3 per cent of patients. A significant improvement in cochlear function was seen in 14 per cent of patients, and hearing was preserved or improved in 88 per cent. For the bilateral group, vertigo control was obtained in 85.7 per cent of patients and cochlear function improved in 28 per cent. Hearing preservation was attained in 71 per cent of these patients.\nEndolymphatic sac drainage is a good surgical option for patients with incapacitating endolymphatic hydrops, providing a high percentage of vertigo control and hearing preservation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e18","authors":["R F Bento","J C Cisneros","A C De Oliveira Fonseca"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0022215116009713","endpage":"6","first_seen_on":"2016-12-19T22:08:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1748-5460"],"journal":"Journal of Laryngology & Otology","last_mentioned_on":1482185269,"links":["https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/journals\/journal-of-laryngology-and-otology\/article\/div-classtitleendolymphatic-sac-drainage-for-the-treatment-of-meniereandaposs-diseasediv\/D34E8A02FABBC44C0C0B465F557DE9B4"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/services\/aop-cambridge-core\/content\/view\/D34E8A02FABBC44C0C0B465F557DE9B4\/S0022215116009713a.pdf\/div-class-title-endolymphatic-sac-drainage-for-the-treatment-of-meniereandapos-s-disease-div.pdf","pmid":"27974068","pubdate":"2016-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Endolymphatic sac drainage for the treatment of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endolymphatic-sac-drainage-treatment-m%C3%A9ni%C3%A8res-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7909849,"mean":6.6937446400934,"rank":5998396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1061394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7909849,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250611,"mean":12.388915015362,"rank":176894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":45495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250611,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1107,"mean":2.2547179023508,"rank":805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1107,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":0.76637931034483,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LaryngolAndOtol\/statuses\/810969916736159744","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14861299],"posted_on":"2016-12-19T22:07:49+00:00","author":{"name":"LaryngolAndOtol","url":"http:\/\/www.jlo.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/660758606837620736\/JTangxlU_normal.png","description":"The Journal of Laryngology and Otology\nPublishing on Ear, Nose and Throat disorders since 1887.","id_on_source":"LaryngolAndOtol","tweeter_id":"3898685674","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":328},"tweet_id":"810969916736159744"}]}}
