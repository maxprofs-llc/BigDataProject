Steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) is one of the coactivator of steroid nuclear receptors; it is widely distributed in the brain areas that related to learning and memory, reproductive regulation, sensory and motor information integration. Previous studies have revealed high levels of SRC-1 immunoreactivities in the hippocampus; it is closely related to the levels of synaptic proteins such as PSD-95 under normal development or gonadectomy, but its exact roles in the regulation of these proteins remains unclear. In this study, we used aromatase inhibitor letrozole in vivo and SRC-1 RNA interference in vitro to investigate whether SRC-1 mediated endogenous estrogen regulation of hippocampal PSD-95. The results revealed that letrozole injection synchronously decreased hippocampal SRC-1 and PSD-95 in a dose-dependant manner. Furthermore, when SRC-1 specific shRNA pool was applied to block the expression of SRC-1 in the primary hippocampal neuron culture, both immunocytochemistry and Western blot revealed that levels of PSD-95 were also decreased significantly. Taking together, these results provided the first evidence that SRC-1 mediated endogenous estrogen regulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity by targeting expression of synaptic protein PSD-95. Additionally, since letrozole is frequently used to treat estrogen-sensitive breast cancer, the above results also indicate its potential side effects in clinical administration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f3c","authors":["Liu, Mengying","Huangfu, Xuhong","Zhao, Yangang","Zhang, Dongmei","Zhang, Jiqiang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jsbmb.2015.07.011","first_seen_on":"2015-07-30T10:17:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1220"],"journal":"Journal of Steroid Biochemistry & Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1438251898,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26223010?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26223010","pubdate":"2015-07-30T22:00:07+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Steroid receptor coactivator-1 mediates letrozole induced downregulation of postsynaptic protein PSD-95 in the hippocampus of adult female rats.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/steroid-receptor-coactivator1-mediates-letrozole-induced-downregulation-postsynaptic-protein-psd95-h"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5422321,"mean":6.3134805950221,"rank":2691772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2567393,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5422321,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189586,"mean":8.7013418361158,"rank":94070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":87141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189586,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":745,"mean":3.1898064516129,"rank":397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":745,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.068,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
