In this study, a novel epithelial cell-targeting nanoparticle drug delivery system by conjugating minocycline-loaded poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic acid) (PEG-PLA) nanoparticles (NP-MIN) with RGD peptide were developed and administrated locally for targeting periodontitis epithelial cells and enhancing the treatment of periodontitis in dogs. Biodegradable NP-MIN was made with an emulsion\/solvent evaporation technique. RGD peptide was conjugated to the surface of nanoparticles via Maleimide group reaction with hydrosulfide in RGD peptide (RGD-NP-MIN). Transmission electron microscopy examination and dynamic light scattering results revealed that RGD-NP-MIN had a sphere shape, with a mean diameter around 106nm. In vitro release of minocycline from RGD-NP-MIN showed that RGD modification did not change the remarkable sustained releasing characteristic of NP-MIN. To elucidate the interaction of RGD-NP and epithelial cells, RGD-NP binding, uptake and cellular internalization mechanisms by calu-3 cells were investigated. It was shown RGD modification significantly enhanced nanoparticles binding and uptake by Calu-3 cells, and RGD-NP uptake was an energy-dependent process through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Both clathrin-associated endocytosis and caveolae-dependent endocytosis pathway were involved in the RGD-NP uptake, and the intracellular transport of RGD-NP was related to lysosome and Golgi apparatus. Finally, in vivo pharmacokinetics of minocycline in the periodontal pockets and anti-periodontitis effects of RGD-NP-MIN on periodontitis-bearing dogs were evaluated. After local administration of RGD-NP-MIN, minocycline concentration in gingival crevicular fluid decreased slowly and maintained an effective drug concentration for a longer time than that of NP-MIN. Anti-periodontitis effects demonstrated that RGD-NP-MIN could significantly decrease symptoms of periodontitis, which was better than any other control group. These findings suggested that these epithelial cell-targeting nanoparticles offered a novel and effective local delivery system for the treatment of periodontitis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d15","authors":["Yao, Wenxin","Xu, Peicheng","Zhao, Jingjing","Ling, Li","Li, Xiaoxia","Zhang, Bo","Cheng, Nengneng","Pang, Zhiqing"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jcis.2015.07.032","first_seen_on":"2015-07-30T10:49:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1095-7103","00219797"],"journal":"Journal of Colloid & Interface Science","last_mentioned_on":1446050673,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0021979715300515"],"pmid":"26197107","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"RGD functionalized polymeric nanoparticles targeting periodontitis epithelial cells for the enhanced treatment of periodontitis in dogs ","type":"article","volume":"458","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rgd-functionalized-polymeric-nanoparticles-targeting-periodontitis-epithelial-cells-enhanced-treatme"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6500718,"mean":6.0222432796255,"rank":3077373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1943214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6500718,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197150,"mean":8.7664607276731,"rank":107943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":69706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197150,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":650,"mean":1.9709830508475,"rank":182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":650,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":6.7776363636364,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
