Although four effector mechanisms are validated to participate in CD20-based immunotherapy, including complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, caspase-dependent apoptosis, and lysosome-mediated programmed cell death (PCD), they could hardly be synchronously activated by any anti-CD20 mAb or mAb derivative until now. Herein, a novel mAb nanocomb (polyethylenimine polymer-RTX-tositumomab [PPRT nanocomb]) was firstly constructed through mass arming two different anti-CD20 mAbs (RTX and tositumomab) to one polymer by nanotechnology. Comparing with free mAbs, PPRT nanocomb possesses a comparable binding ability and reduced \"off-rate\" to surface CD20 of NHL cells. When treated by PPRT nanocomb, the caspase-dependent apoptosis was remarkably enhanced except for concurrently eliciting complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and lysosome-mediated PCD. Besides, \"cross-cell link\"-assisted homotypic adhesion by PPRT nanocomb further enhanced the susceptibility to PCD of lymphoma cells. Pharmacokinetic assays revealed that PPRT nanocomb experienced a relatively reduced clearance from peripheral blood compared with free antibodies. With the cooperation of all the abovementioned superiorities, PPRT nanocomb exhibits exceptionally excellent in vivo antitumor activities in both disseminated and localized human NHL xenotransplant models.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007966","authors":["Huafei Li","Ting Chen","Ge Zhang","Changhong Ke","Cong Wu","He Zhao","Zheng Xu"],"doi":"10.2147\/ijn.s80129","first_seen_on":"2015-07-30T22:55:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-2013"],"journal":"International Journal of Nanomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1439287925,"links":["http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/construction-and-characterization-of-an-anti-cd20-mab-nanocomb-with-ex-peer-reviewed-article-IJN","http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=22880","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26257518?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=26221","pmid":"26257518","pubdate":"2015-07-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Construction and characterization of an anti-CD20 mAb nanocomb with exceptionally excellent lymphoma-suppressing activity.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/construction-characterization-anticd20-mab-nanocomb-exceptionally-excellent-lymphomasuppressing-acti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5472368,"mean":6.3578424367363,"rank":1279178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":4170368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5472368,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192372,"mean":8.6475999085102,"rank":55225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":136403,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192372,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1451,"mean":1.7586193103448,"rank":122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":1325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1451,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141,"mean":1.9310714285714,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
