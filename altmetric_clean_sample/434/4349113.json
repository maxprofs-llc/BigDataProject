We estimated adjusted incidence rates and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for GP and hospital contacts according to depressive and anxiety symptoms, educational level and cohabitation status.\nDuring the 24-month period after the MI, patients with anxiety symptoms had 24% more GP contacts (adjusted IRR 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-1.36) than patients with no anxiety symptoms. In contrast, patients with depressive symptoms (1.05, 0.94-1.16) and with short and medium education (<10 years: 0.96, 0.84-1.08; 10-12 years: 0.91, 0.80-1.03) and patients living alone (0.95, 0.87-1.04) had the same number of GP contacts as their counterparts (patients with no depressive symptoms, with long education [>12 years] and patients living with a partner). During the first 6 months after the MI, patients living alone had 13% fewer hospital contacts (0.87, 0.77-0.99), patients with short education had 16% fewer hospital contacts (<10 years: 0.84, 0.72-0.98) and patients with anxiety symptoms had 27% fewer hospital contacts (0.73, 0.62-0.86) than their counterparts. In contrast, patients with depressive symptoms (0.92, 0.77-1.10) and medium education (10-12 years: 1.05, 0.91-1.22) had the same number of hospital contacts as their counterparts.\nThis study indicates that patients with depressive symptoms, short and medium education and patients living alone have a lower long-term use of healthcare contacts following MI than patients without these risk factors. Patients with depressive symptoms and low socioeconomic position would be expected to have a higher need of healthcare after MI as they have a poorer prognosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Tine Jepsen Nielsen","Mogens Vestergaard","Morten Fenger-Gr\u00f8n","Bo Christensen","Karen Kj\u00e6r Larsen"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0134557","first_seen_on":"2015-07-31T06:06:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1438335968,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0134557","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0134557"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0134557.PDF","pmid":"26225864","pubdate":"2015-07-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Healthcare Contacts after Myocardial Infarction According to Mental Health and Socioeconomic Position: A Population-Based Cohort Study","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/healthcare-contacts-after-myocardial-infarction-according-mental-health-socioeconomic-position-popul-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5428000,"mean":6.3206828302661,"rank":2883136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1845016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5428000,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189773,"mean":8.7439020614212,"rank":103570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":67667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189773,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94492,"mean":9.610487644326,"rank":53928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":30354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94492,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6165,"mean":8.4350639195328,"rank":3627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6165,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
