The patient reported that his mandibular 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 bonded retainer had been partially debonded and broken 4\u00a0years earlier. The mandibular left lateral incisor remained bonded to the retainer and received the entire load of the incisors; consequently, there was extreme labial movement of the root, resulting in dental avulsion. As part of the treatment, the root was repositioned lingually using a titanium-molybdenum segmented archwire for 8\u00a0months, followed by endodontic treatment, an apicoectomy, and 4\u00a0months of alignment and leveling of both arches. The treatment outcomes were excellent, and the tooth remained stable, with good integrity of the mesial, distal, and lingual alveolar bones and periodontal ligament. The 1-year follow-up showed good stability of the results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005711","authors":["Farret, Marcel M","Farret, Milton M B","da Luz Vieira, Gustavo","Assaf, Jamal Hassan","de Lima, Eduardo Martinelli S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajodo.2015.04.027","first_seen_on":"2015-07-31T03:42:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0889-5406","1097-6752"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal of Orthodontics & Dentofacial Orthopedics","last_mentioned_on":1440605996,"links":["http:\/\/www.ajodo.org\/article\/S0889-5406(15)00609-5\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ajodo.org\/action\/showFullTextImages?pii=S0889-5406(15)00609-5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajodo.org\/article\/S0889540615006095\/pdf","pmid":"26232842","pubdate":"2015-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","orthodontics"],"title":"Orthodontic treatment of a mandibular incisor fenestration resulting from a broken retainer","type":"article","volume":"148","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/orthodontic-treatment-mandibular-incisor-fenestration-resulting-broken-retainer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5552256,"mean":6.3814498674846,"rank":2268100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":3255301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5552256,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193031,"mean":8.7123580065274,"rank":74161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":117304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193031,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":604,"mean":2.0795953565506,"rank":158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":604,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
