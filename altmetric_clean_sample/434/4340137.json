An ACCD bacterial strain, SBP-8, identified as Klebsiella sp., also having other plant-growth-promoting activities, was isolated from Sorghum bicolor growing in the desertregion of Rajasthan, India. ACCD activity of SBP-8 was characterized at biochemical, physiological, and molecular levels. The presence of AcdS, a structural gene for ACCD, was confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction. Strain SBP-8 showed optimum growth and ACCD activity at increased salt (NaCl) concentrations of up to 6%, indicating its potential to survive and associate with plants growing in saline soil. Inoculation of wheat plants with SBP-8 when grow in the presence of salt (150-200mM) and temperature (30-40\u00b0C) stressors resulted inamelioration of stress conditions by increasing plant biomass and chlorophyll content, and are duction in plant growth inhibition (10-100%) occurred due to salt and temperature stressors. Moreover, strain SBP-8 also caused Na(+) exclusion (65%) and increased uptake of K(+) (84.21%) in the host plant. This property can protect plants from adverse effects of Na(+) on plant growth and physiology. Thus, SBP-8 improves growth of the host plant and protects from salt stressors through more than one mechanism including an effect of ACCD activity and on K(+)\/Na(+) ratio in plants. The colonization efficiency of strain SBP-8 was confirmedby CFU (colony-forming unit) count, microscopy, and ERIC-PCR based DNA-finger-printing approach. Therefore, and the use of efficient colonizing plant-growth-promoting bacteria may provideinsights into possible biotechnological approaches to decrease the impact of salinity and other stressors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ed1","authors":["Singh, Rajnish Prakash","Jha, Prameela","Jha, Prabhat Nath"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jplph.2015.07.002","first_seen_on":"2015-07-29T10:04:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1618-1328"],"journal":"Journal of Plant Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1463660195,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26217911?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26217911","pubdate":"2015-07-29T22:00:26+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"The plant-growth-promoting bacterium Klebsiella sp.
