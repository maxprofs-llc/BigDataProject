Subepic delayed gadolinium enhncement in asymptomatic athletes: let sleeping dogs lie? - PubMed - NCBI"],"citation":{"abstract":"Subepicardial delayed gadolinium enhancement (DGE) patches without underlying cardiomyopathy is poorly understood. It is often reported as the result of prior silent myocarditis. Its prognostic relevance in asymptomatic athletes is unknown; therefore, medical clearance for competitive sports participation is debated. This case series aims to relate this pattern of DGE in athletes to outcome.\nWe report on seven young asymptomatic athletes with isolated subepicardial DGE detected during workup of abnormalities on their regular screening examination, that is, pathological T-wave inversions on ECG (n=4) or ventricular arrhythmias on exercise test (n=3). All underwent a comprehensive initial investigation in order to assess left ventricular (LV) function at rest and exercise (exercise cardiac MRI and\/or exercise echocardiography) and occurrence of arrhythmias (exercise test, 24\u2005h-ECG Holter, electrophysiological study). All underwent a careful follow-up with biannual evaluation.\nAll athletes had extensive subepicardial DGE (12.0\u00b14.8% of LV mass), predominantly in the lateral wall. Three athletes had non-sustained ventricular arrhythmias, whereas two of them had LV ejection fraction <50% at rest with no contractile reserve at exercise. During a follow-up of 3.0\u00b11.5\u2005years in the four remaining athletes, two had symptomatic ventricular tachycardia and one demonstrated progressive LV dysfunction. Hence, six of seven athletes had to be excluded from competitive sports participation.\nIsolated large areas of subepicardial DGE in an asymptomatic athlete are not benign and require a careful evaluation at exercise and a strict follow-up. These findings question whether extreme exercise during silent myocarditis may facilitate fibrosis generation and adverse remodelling.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002456","authors":["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Schnell","Guido Claessen","Andr\u00e9 La Gerche","Jan Bogaert","Pierre-Axel Lentz","Piet Claus","Philippe Mabo","Fran\u00e7ois Carr\u00e9","Hein Heidbuchel"],"doi":"10.1136\/bjsports-2014-094546","first_seen_on":"2015-07-29T16:57:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["14730480","1473-0480","0306-3674"],"journal":"British Journal of Sports Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1488782446,"links":["http:\/\/bjsm.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/29\/bjsports-2014-094546.short?rss=1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26224114","http:\/\/bjsm.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/29\/bjsports-2014-094546.short?g=w_bjsm_ahead_tab","http:\/\/m.bjsm.bmj.com\/content\/50\/2\/111?etoc","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/bjsports-2014-094546"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bjsm.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/29\/bjsports-2014-094546.full.pdf","pmid":"26224114","pubdate":"2015-08-01T14:20:35+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and British Association of Sport and Exercise Medicine","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"title":"Subepicardial delayed gadolinium enhancement in asymptomatic athletes: let sleeping dogs lie?","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bjsm.bmj.com\/lookup\/doi\/10.1136\/bjsports-2014-094546","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/subepicardial-delayed-gadolinium-enhancement-asymptomatic-athletes-sleeping-dogs-lie"},"altmetric_score":{"score":18.4,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":18.4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":470573,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7846414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230663,"mean":8.4795930495704,"rank":18249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":212390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230663,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4104,"mean":35.211579332196,"rank":1207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":2897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4104,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":65.628883116883,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"researcher":3,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":9,"Scientists":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
