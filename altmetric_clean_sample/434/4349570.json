The purpose of this study was to correlate tear serotonin levels, as a marker of nociceptor sensitization, to facets of dry eye (DE), including symptoms and signs.\nCross-sectional study.\nA total of 62 patients with normal eyelid and corneal anatomy were prospectively recruited from a Veterans Administration Ophthalmology Clinic over 11 months.\nDry eye symptoms (Ocular Surface Disease Index [OSDI]), signs (tear break-up time [TBUT], corneal staining, and Schirmer's score), and clinical descriptors of neuropathic ocular pain (NOP) (sensitivity to light or sensitivity to wind) were assessed. For tear analysis, each patient's tears were collected after instilling 50\u00a0\u03bcl of sterile saline to the lower cul-de-sac of each eye and using capillary action microcaps to collect the ocular wash. Tear serotonin levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nCorrelations between tear serotonin concentrations and DE symptoms and signs.\nThe mean age of the population was 61\u00b114 years, and 84% (n\u00a0= 52) of the patients were male. Serotonin concentrations negatively correlated with Schirmer's scores (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.28; P\u00a0= 0.02) but did not correlate with other DE parameters, such as OSDI scores, sensitivity to light or wind, TBUT, and staining. According to our hypothesis, we divided patients into groups based on both DE symptoms and aqueous tear production; serotonin concentrations were significantly higher in DE group 1 (OSDI \u22656 and Schirmer's <8) compared with both DE group 2 (OSDI \u22656 and Schirmer's \u22658) and controls (OSDI <6 and Schirmer's \u22658). Patients in DE group 2 more frequently reported sensitivity to light (64%) and wind (67%) compared with DE group 1 (40% and 60%, respectively) and controls (8% and 17%, respectively).\nPatients with DE symptoms and aqueous tear deficiency had higher tear serotonin levels compared with those with DE symptoms but normal tear production and those without DE symptoms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003250","authors":["Chhadva, Priyanka","Lee, Tinthu","Sarantopoulos, Constantine D","Hackam, Abigail S","McClellan, Allison L","Felix, Elizabeth R","Levitt, Roy C","Galor, Anat"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ophtha.2015.04.010","first_seen_on":"2015-07-31T10:01:38+00:00","issns":["1549-4713","0161-6420"],"journal":"Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1445076760,"links":["http:\/\/www.aaojournal.org\/article\/S0161-6420(15)00358-9\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25983214?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.aaojournal.org\/article\/S0161642015003589\/pdf","pmid":"25983214","pubdate":"2015-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Human Tear Serotonin Levels Correlate with Symptoms and Signs of Dry Eye.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-tear-serotonin-levels-correlate-symptoms-signs-dry-eye"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6278272,"mean":5.9867156995941,"rank":2286116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3964677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6278272,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183317,"mean":8.9542704946651,"rank":69467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":112434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183317,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1881,"mean":10.929489361702,"rank":695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1881,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":8.0277666666667,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
