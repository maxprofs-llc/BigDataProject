(K. Kamiya)"],"citation":{"abstract":"The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an important cathode reaction of various types of fuel cells. The development of electrocatalysts composed only of abundant elements is a key goal because currently only platinum is a suitable catalyst for ORR. Herein, we synthesized copper-modified covalent triazine frameworks (CTF) hybridized with carbon nanoparticles (Cu-CTF\/CPs) as efficient electrocatalysts for the ORR in neutral solutions. The ORR onset potential of the synthesized Cu-CTF\/CP was 810 mV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE; pH 7), the highest reported value at neutral pH for synthetic Cu-based electrocatalysts. Cu-CTF\/CP also displayed higher stability than a Cu-based molecular complex at neutral pH during the ORR, a property that was likely as a result of the covalently cross-linked structure of CTF. This work may provide a new platform for the synthesis of durable non-noble-metal electrocatalysts for various target reactions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Iwase, Kazuyuki","Yoshioka, Tatsuro","Nakanishi, Shuji","Hashimoto, Kazuhito","Kamiya, Kazuhide"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201503637","endpage":"11072","first_seen_on":"2015-07-30T23:34:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773"],"issue":"38","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
