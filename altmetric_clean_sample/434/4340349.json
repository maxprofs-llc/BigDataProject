Agreement between versions of each questionnaire was summarized by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). The correlation between MiniPAQLQ and PACQLQ scores from child-caregiver pairs was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient.\nThere was no significant difference (mean difference\u00a0=\u00a00.1, 95\u00a0% CI -0.1, 0.2) in MiniPAQLQ Overall Scores between paper (5.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0, mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) and electronic (5.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0) versions, or any of the domains. ICCs ranged from 0.89 (Overall) to 0.86 (Emotional Function). Overall PACQLQ scores for both versions were comparable (5.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9 and 5.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0; mean difference\u00a0=\u00a00.0; 95\u00a0% CI -0.1, 0.2). ICCs ranged from 0.81 (Activity Limitation) to 0.88 (Emotional Function). The electronic PACQLQ took 26\u00a0s longer (95\u00a0% CI 11, 41; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Few participants (3-11\u00a0%) preferred the paper format. MiniPAQLQ and PACQLQ scores were significantly correlated (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) for Overall (r paper\u00a0=\u00a00.33, r electronic\u00a0=\u00a00.27) and Emotional Function domains (r paper\u00a0=\u00a00.34, r electronic\u00a0=\u00a00.29).\nThese electronic QOL questionnaires are valid, and asthma-related QOL of children and caregivers is related.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f61000340e","authors":["Minard, Janice P","Thomas, Nicola J","Olajos-Clow, Jennifer G","Wasilewski, Nastasia V","Jenkins, Blaine","Taite, Ann K","Day, Andrew G","Lougheed, M Diane"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11136-015-1055-y","first_seen_on":"2015-07-29T10:12:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-2649"],"journal":"Quality of Life Research","last_mentioned_on":1472553559,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26216583?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26216583?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26216583","pubdate":"2015-07-29T22:00:48+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Quality of Life Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sociology, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Assessing the burden of childhood asthma: validation of electronic versions of the Mini Pediatric and Pediatric Asthma Caregiver's Quality of Life Questionnaires.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessing-burden-childhood-asthma-validation-electronic-versions-mini-pediatric-pediatric-asthma-car"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":6299494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1123425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230583,"mean":8.4788195869582,"rank":158966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":38759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230583,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1310,"mean":3.3942964094729,"rank":897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1310,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":1.9730158730159,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
