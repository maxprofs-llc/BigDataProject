An illustrative case is used to highlight the types of expertise needed in specialized transition service delivery for patients with significant complexity. The team's analysis of their transdisciplinary work processes further explains the work.\nNearly three hundred youth with complex needs are served yearly. Families and primary care providers express high satisfaction with the support of the services. The case example shows the broad array of transition-specific services engaged beyond the usual skill set of pediatric or adult care coordination teams. Transdisciplinary team uses skills in collaboration, support, learning, and compromise within a trusting and respectful environment. They describe the shared responsibility and continuous learning of the whole team.\nYouth with complex medical conditions and complex social situations are at higher risk for problems during transition. Serving this population with a transdisciplinary model is time consuming and requires advanced expertise but, with those investments, we can meet the expectations of the youth, their families and primary care providers. Successful transdisciplinary teamwork requires sustained and focused investment. Further work is needed to describe the complexity of this service delivery along with distinct transition outcomes and costs comparisons.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a86","authors":["Ciccarelli, Mary R","Gladstone, Erin B","Armstrong Richardson, Eprise A J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pedn.2015.07.003","first_seen_on":"2015-07-30T01:12:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0882-5963","1532-8449"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatric Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1438218703,"links":["http:\/\/www.pediatricnursing.org\/article\/S0882-5963(15)00224-9\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pediatricnursing.org\/article\/S0882596315002249\/pdf","pmid":"26233635","pubdate":"2015-08-05T22:02:44+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","pediatrics"],"title":"Implementation of a Transdisciplinary Team for the Transition Support of Medically and Socially Complex Youth","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/implementation-transdisciplinary-team-transition-support-medically-socially-complex-youth"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5422321,"mean":6.3134805950221,"rank":3815934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":910724,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5422321,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189586,"mean":8.7014510219691,"rank":131266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":37477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189586,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":337,"mean":2.7885357142857,"rank":183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":337,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":0.97096774193548,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
