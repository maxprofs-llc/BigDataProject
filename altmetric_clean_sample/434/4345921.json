Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that is not assimilated by the host and is released into the environment where it contributes to climate change. Since enteric methane is exclusively produced by methanogenic archaea, the investigation of mutualistic methanogen communities in the GIT of herbivores has been the subject of ongoing research by a number of research groups. In an effort to uncover trends that would facilitate the development of efficient methane mitigation strategies for livestock species, we have in this review summarized and compared currently available results from published studies on this subject. We also offer our perspectives on the importance of pursuing current research efforts on the sequencing of gut methanogen genomes, as well as investigating their cellular physiology and interactions with other GIT microorganisms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc10","authors":["St-Pierre, Benoit","Cersosimo, Laura M.","Ishaq, Suzanne L.","Wright, Andr\u00e9-Denis G."],"doi":"10.3389\/fmicb.2015.00776","first_seen_on":"2015-07-30T13:56:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-302X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1440348331,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fmicb.2015.00776\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26284054?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26284054?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26284054"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fmicb.2015.00776\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4519756","pmid":"26284054","pubdate":"2015-07-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Toward the identification of methanogenic archaeal groups as targets of methane mitigation in livestock animalsr.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/toward-identification-methanogenic-archaeal-groups-targets-methane-mitigation-livestock-animals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6798714,"mean":6.1796621228137,"rank":1393796,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5397327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6798714,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223239,"mean":8.0949510029654,"rank":55946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":166841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223239,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4693,"mean":3.8260903665814,"rank":1072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":3603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4693,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":339,"mean":3.7381420118343,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":339,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
