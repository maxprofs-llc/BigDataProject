More than 50% of human cancers contain a mutation or deletion of the p53 gene, and p53R175 is one of the hot spots of p53 mutation. Nucleic acid aptamers are short single-stranded oligonucleotides that are able to bind various targets, and they are typically isolated from an experimental procedure called systematic evolution of ligand exponential enrichment (SELEX). Using a previously unidentified strategy of contrast screening with SELEX, we have isolated an RNA aptamer targeting p53R175H. This RNA aptamer (p53R175H-APT) has a significantly stronger affinity to p53R175H than to the wild-type p53 in both in vitro and in vivo assays. p53R175H-APT decreased the growth rate, weakened the migration capability, and triggered apoptosis in human lung cancer cells harboring p53R175H. Further analysis actually indicated that p53R175H-APT might partially rescue or correct the p53R175H to function more like the wild-type p53. In situ injections of p53R175H-APT to the tumor xenografts confirmed the effects of this RNA aptamer on p53R175H mutation in mice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Chen, Liang","Rashid, Farooq","Shah, Abdullah","Awan, Hassaan M","Wu, Mingming","Liu, An","Wang, Jun","Zhu, Tao","Luo, Zhaofeng","Shan, Ge"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1502159112","first_seen_on":"2015-07-29T10:00:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1091-6490"],"issue":"32","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1439765621,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26216949?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/112\/32\/10002.long"],"pmid":"26216949","pubdate":"2015-07-29T22:00:40+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"The isolation of an RNA aptamer targeting to p53 protein with single amino acid mutation","type":"article","volume":"112","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isolation-rna-aptamer-targeting-p53-protein-single-amino-acid-mutation-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5487712,"mean":6.3730424488449,"rank":2278133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3120941,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5487712,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192436,"mean":8.6576082833165,"rank":75532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":113145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192436,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39391,"mean":20.34222899213,"rank":26315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":12461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39391,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":962,"mean":35.785808532778,"rank":727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":962,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1},"mendeley":{"CN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/genomeguardian\/status\/626331349247393792","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4340076],"posted_on":"2015-07-29T10:00:04+00:00","author":{"name":"TP53","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516935062370000897\/PnU7aavz_normal.jpeg","description":"A twitterbot dedicated to supplying the most recent papers about p53, the Guardian of the Genome.","id_on_source":"genomeguardian","tweeter_id":"2794540623","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":173},"tweet_id":"626331349247393792"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/aptamer_connect\/status\/628910759741820928","license":"datasift","rt":["genomeguardian"],"citation_ids":[4340076],"posted_on":"2015-08-05T12:49:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Sarah Shigdar","url":"http:\/\/www.sarahshigdar.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/475946689744756738\/PZH999TL_normal.jpeg","description":"Scientist developing aptamers into novel diagnostics and therapeutics @ Deakin Uni, Australia.
