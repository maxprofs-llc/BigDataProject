The host cell Integrator complex, which recognizes the snRNA 3' end processing signal (3' box), generates the 5' ends of HVS pre-miRNA hairpins. Here, we identify a novel 3' box-like sequence (miRNA 3' box) downstream from HVS pre-miRNAs that is essential for miRNA biogenesis. In vivo knockdown and rescue experiments confirmed that the 3' end processing of HVS pre-miRNAs also depends on Integrator activity. Interaction between Integrator and HVS primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) substrates that contain only the miRNA 3' box was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and an in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) that we developed to localize specific transient RNA-protein interactions inside cells. Surprisingly, in contrast to snRNA 3' end processing, HVS pre-miRNA 3' end processing by Integrator can be uncoupled from transcription, enabling new approaches to study Integrator enzymology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293c","authors":["Xie, Mingyi","Zhang, Wei","Shu, Mei-Di","Xu, Acer","Lenis, Diana A","DiMaio, Daniel","Steitz, Joan A"],"doi":"10.1101\/gad.266973.115","endpage":"1564","first_seen_on":"2015-07-31T00:35:57+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","nci"],"issns":["1549-5477","0890-9369"],"issue":"14","journal":"Genes & Development","last_mentioned_on":1438877393,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26220997?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/genesdev.cshlp.org\/content\/29\/14\/1552.long"],"pmid":"26220997","pubdate":"2015-07-31T22:00:45+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1552","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"The host Integrator complex acts in transcription-independent maturation of herpesvirus microRNA 3' ends.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/host-integrator-complex-acts-transcriptionindependent-maturation-herpesvirus-microrna-3-ends"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5450613,"mean":6.3471088853875,"rank":1230127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":4216752,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5450613,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190310,"mean":8.744108192466,"rank":52550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":137570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190310,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2787,"mean":4.1958499641062,"rank":588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2787,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":7.2392692307692,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Lecturer":2,"Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
