It remains unclear whether memory capacity influences the ability of adults with ADHD to reproduce time intervals.\nWe conducted a behavioral study on 30 ADHD patients who were medicated with methylphenidate, 29 unmedicated adult ADHD patients and 32 healthy controls (HCs). We assessed time reproduction using six time intervals (1 s, 4 s, 6 s, 10 s, 24 s and 60 s) and assessed memory performance using the Wechsler memory scale.\nThe patients with ADHD exhibited lower memory performance scores than the HCs. No significant differences in the raw scores for any of the time intervals (p > .05), with the exception of the variability at the short time intervals (1 s, 4 s and 6 s) (p < .01), were found between the groups. The overall analyses failed to reveal any significant correlations between time reproduction at any of the time intervals examined in the time reproduction task and working memory performance (p > .05).\nWe detected no findings indicating that working memory might influence time reproduction in adult patients with ADHD. Therefore, further studies concerning time reproduction and memory capacity among adult patients with ADHD must be performed to verify and replicate the present findings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Christian Mette","Marco Grabemann","Marco Zimmermann","Laura Strunz","Norbert Scherbaum","Jens Wiltfang","Bernhard Kis"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0133714","first_seen_on":"2015-07-29T20:07:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1438250800,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0133714"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0133714.PDF","pmid":"26221955","pubdate":"2015-07-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"No Clear Association between Impaired Short-Term or Working Memory Storage and Time Reproduction Capacity in Adult ADHD Patients","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clear-association-between-impaired-shortterm-working-memory-storage-time-reproduction-capacity-adult"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5422157,"mean":6.3120406882422,"rank":3589871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1606599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5422157,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189518,"mean":8.7014746012232,"rank":122211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":58268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189518,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94452,"mean":9.6027791341543,"rank":64185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":25875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94452,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6122,"mean":8.4160970429668,"rank":4173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6122,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
