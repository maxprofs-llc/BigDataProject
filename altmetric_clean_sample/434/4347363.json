The present study compared the effectiveness and acceptability of internet and DVD formats of DAs for osteoarthritis (OA).\nPatients with hip or knee OA were randomized to view an internet or DVD format DA, which provided information on OA treatments. Measures were collected at baseline, immediately after viewing the DA and then 30 days later. Outcomes included: Hip\/Knee OA Decision Quality Instrument - Knowledge Subscale (HK-DQI Knowledge), Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), Preparation for Decision Making Scale (PDMS), Stage of Decision Making, and Acceptability of DAs. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to examine changes in HK-DQI Knowledge and DCS scores over time, between decision aid groups and within the sample overall. Group differences in the PDMS scale (assessed once, immediately after DA viewing) were estimated using a Wilcoxon rank sums test.\nAmong 155 participants in the study, the mean age was 61.8\u2009years, 60.6% were women and 58.1% were Caucasian. HK-DQI Knowledge scores improved over time (p\u2009<\u20090.001), although there was some attenuation by the 30-day follow-up; there was no difference between the two DA groups (p\u2009=\u20090.448). DCS scores decreased markedly for both groups (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and improvements were maintained by the 30-day follow-up (means: internet: baseline\u2009=\u200925.0, 30-day\u2009=\u20096.9; DVD: baseline\u2009=\u200925.0, 30-day\u2009=\u20096.2); there was no difference between the two DA groups (p\u2009=\u20090.808). PDMS scores were higher for the DVD group than the internet group (85.2 versus 74.9, p\u2009=\u20090.005). Stage of Decision Making became more certain after viewing the DA for both groups, with even more certainty indicated at 30-day follow-up. Acceptability items indicated positive perceptions of both DAs.\nInternet and DVD DAs were associated with meaningful, comparable improvements in decision-making outcomes in patients with knee and hip OA. DAs are inexpensive to disseminate and could be valuable tools for enhancing care for OA.
