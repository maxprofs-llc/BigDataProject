Intraoperative blood loss in orthotopic liver transplantation. #patientbloodmanagement"],"citation":{"abstract":"Liver transplantation has been associated with massive blood loss and considerable transfusion requirements. Bleeding in orthotopic liver transplantation is multifactorial. Technical difficulties inherent to this complex surgical procedure and pre operative derangements of the primary and secondary coagulation system are thought to be the principal causes of perioperative hemorrhage. Intraoperative practices such as massive fluid resuscitation and resulting hypothermia and hypocalcemia secondary to citrate toxicity further aggravate the preexisting coagulopathy and worsen the perioperative bleeding. Excessive blood loss and transfusion during orthotopic liver transplant are correlated with diminished graft survival and increased septic episodes and prolonged ICU stay. With improvements in surgical skills, anesthetic technique, graft preservation, use of intraoperative cell savers and overall perioperative management, orthotopic liver transplant is now associated with decreased intra operative blood losses. The purpose of this review is to discuss the risk factors predictive of increased intra operative bleeding in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplant.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc94","authors":["Pandey, Chandra Kant","Singh, Anshuman","Kajal, Kamal","Dhankhar, Mandeep","Tandon, Manish","Pandey, Vijay Kant","Karna, Sunaina Tejpal"],"doi":"10.4240\/wjgs.v7.i6.86","first_seen_on":"2015-07-31T10:20:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1948-9366"],"issue":"6","journal":"World Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1439224138,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26131330","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4240\/wjgs.v7.i6.86"],"pmid":"26131330","pubdate":"2015-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Intraoperative blood loss in orthotopic liver transplantation: The predictive factors.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intraoperative-blood-loss-orthotopic-liver-transplantation-predictive-factors-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5573648,"mean":6.3367143947228,"rank":2168588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3398187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5573648,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192851,"mean":8.7106120508168,"rank":69371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":123162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192851,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":0.882,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bloodmgmt\/status\/627061326188310529","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4349631],"posted_on":"2015-07-31T10:20:45+00:00","author":{"name":"SABM","url":"http:\/\/www.sabm.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2148841282\/logo_normal.jpg","description":"The Society for the Advancement of Blood Management's mission is to improve health outcomes by advancing comprehensive patient blood management practices.","id_on_source":"bloodmgmt","tweeter_id":"44149944","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":731},"tweet_id":"627061326188310529"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SwabTech\/status\/628855143266668544","license":"datasift","rt":["bloodmgmt"],"citation_ids":[4349631],"posted_on":"2015-08-05T09:08:44+00:00","author":{"name":"SwabTech","url":"http:\/\/www.SwabTech.co.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/579361524084551681\/qwDq9qGg_normal.jpg","description":"Enhanced Blood Recovery, Intra-operative Cell Salvage, Medical Device Innovation, Patient Blood Management","id_on_source":"SwabTech","tweeter_id":"3102530399","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":69},"tweet_id":"628855143266668544"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Tissuemed\/status\/630777870063898624","license":"datasift","rt":["bloodmgmt"],"citation_ids":[4349631],"posted_on":"2015-08-10T16:28:58+00:00","author":{"name":"Tissuemed Ltd","url":"http:\/\/www.tissuemed.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/623157772151058432\/vDBW_jvf_normal.jpg","description":"Experts in bioadhesives: \nTissuemed develops and markets adhesive films to prevent air, blood and fluid leaks encountered in surgery","id_on_source":"Tissuemed","tweeter_id":"212171481","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":114},"tweet_id":"630777870063898624"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Intraoperative blood loss in orthotopic liver transplantation: The predictive factors. - PubMed...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=10154172334619569&id=199809544568","license":"public","citation_ids":[4349631],"posted_on":"2015-07-31T10:19:04+00:00","summary":"World J Gastrointest Surg. 2015 Jun 27;7(6):86-93. doi: 10.4240\/wjgs.v7.i6.86.
