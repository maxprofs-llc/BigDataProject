This severe GRMD phenotype includes atrophy of the biceps femoris (BF) as compared to unaffected normal dogs, while the long digital extensor (LDE), which functions to flex the tibiotarsal joint and serves as a digital extensor, undergoes the most pronounced atrophy. A recent microarray analysis of GRMD identified alterations in genes associated with lipid metabolism and energy production.\nWe, therefore, undertook a non-targeted metabolomics analysis of the GRMD BF (affected) and LDE (unaffected) using GC-MS to identify underlying metabolic defects specific for affected GRMD skeletal muscle.\nUntargeted metabolomics analysis of severely-affected GRMD muscle (BF) identified eight significantly altered metabolites in affected GRMD muscle (BF), including significantly decreased stearamide (0.23-fold of controls, p = 2.89 \u00d7 10(-3)), carnosine (0.40-fold of controls, p = 1.88 \u00d7 10(-2)), fumaric acid (0.40-fold of controls, p = 7.40 \u00d7 10(-4)), lactamide (0.33-fold of controls, p = 4.84 \u00d7 10(-2)), myoinositol-2-phosphate (0.45-fold of controls, p = 3.66 \u00d7 10(-2)), and significantly increased oleic acid (1.77-fold of controls, p = 9.27 \u00d7 10(-2)), glutamic acid (2.48-fold of controls, p = 2.63 \u00d7 10(-2)), and proline (1.73-fold of controls, p = 3.01 \u00d7 10(-2)). Pathway enrichment analysis identified significant enrichment for arginine\/proline metabolism (p = 5.88 \u00d7 10(-4), FDR 4.7 \u00d7 10(-2)), where alterations in L-glutamic acid, proline, and carnosine were found. Additionally, multiple Krebs cycle intermediates were significantly decreased (e.g., malic acid, fumaric acid, citric\/isocitric acid, and succinic acid), suggesting that altered energy metabolism may be underlying the observed GRMD BF muscle dysfunction.\nThe identification of elevated BF oleic acid (a long-chain fatty acid) is consistent with recent microarray studies identifying altered lipid metabolism genes, while alterations in arginine and proline metabolism are consistent with recent studies identifying elevated L-arginine in DMD patient sera as a biomarker of disease. Together, these studies demonstrate muscle-specific alterations in GRMD-affected muscle, which illustrate previously unidentified metabolic changes.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef742a83ee09648b51a1","authors":["Muhammad Abdullah","Joe Kornegay","Aubree Honcoop","Traci Parry","Cynthia Balog-Alvarez","Sara O\u2019Neal","James Bain","Michael Muehlbauer","Christopher Newgard","Cam Patterson","Monte Willis"],"doi":"10.3390\/metabo7030038","first_seen_on":"2017-07-30T08:28:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2218-1989"],"issue":"3","journal":"Metabolites","last_mentioned_on":1502848554,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2218-1989\/7\/3\/38","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/metabo7030038"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2218-1989\/7\/3\/38\/pdf","pmid":"28758940","pubdate":"2017-07-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Non-Targeted Metabolomics Analysis of Golden Retriever Muscular Dystrophy-Affected Muscles Reveals Alterations in Arginine and Proline Metabolism, and Elevations in Glutamic and Oleic Acid  In Vivo","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nontargeted-metabolomics-analysis-golden-retriever-muscular-dystrophyaffected-muscles-reveals-altera"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":1.6,"3m":1.6,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":3947351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4405056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213585,"mean":12.658517388943,"rank":96788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":115159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213585,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182,"mean":3.0794696132597,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.125,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Professor":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BassReelz\/statuses\/891571767013191680","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23216965],"posted_on":"2017-07-30T08:10:48+00:00","author":{"name":"David Jorgensen","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/453778768557899777\/TF_3dSJU_normal.jpeg","description":"Dad of 3, Geospatial Analyst, looking for a cure for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.
