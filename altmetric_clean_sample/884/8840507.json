CT images were analyzed with a computer-aided software.\nVolume and position of orbital cyst, microphthalmic to contralateral ratio (MCR) of orbital volume, height and depth and orbital rim displacement.\n38.1% of the cysts located anterior to or at the equator of the globe, 75% of which located infratemporally and all of which were outside the muscle cone. Most (84.6%) of the posterior cysts were inside the muscle cone. The anterior cysts were larger than the posterior cysts (p = 0.005). MCR of orbital volume (p<0.001), height (p = 0.004) and width (p = 0.043) were significantly higher in patients with orbital cyst than controls. For patients with orbital cyst, larger cyst-plus-globe volume of the affected eye was associated with higher MCR of orbital volume (r = 0.630, p = 0.003). Patients with large cyst-plus-globe volume had higher MCR of orbital volume (p = 0.002), height (p = 0.014), width (p = 0.005) and depth (p = 0.002) and less displacement in inferior (p = 0.004) orbital rim, compared with patients with small cyst-plus-globe volume, but the differences between patients with small cyst-plus-globe volume and patients without cyst were not significant.\nMicrophthalmic eyes with large cyst-plus-globe volume showed better similarity with the contralateral eyes, comparing with microphthalmic eyes without orbital cyst or with small cyst-plus-globe volume. It suggested that the existence of orbital cysts (especially large cysts) in microphthalmic eyes might play a positive role in the orbital development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Ying Cui","Yue Zhang","Qinglin Chang","Junfang Xian","Zhijia Hou","Dongmei Li"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0157819","first_seen_on":"2016-06-18T00:10:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1466264595,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0157819","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0157819&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0157819","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0157819"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0157819.PDF","pmcid":"PMC4912088","pmid":"27315369","pubdate":"2016-06-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0157819","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Digital Evaluation of Orbital Cyst Associated with Microphthalmos: Characteristics and Their Relationship with Orbital Volume","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/digital-evaluation-orbital-cyst-associated-microphthalmos-characteristics-relationship-orbital-volum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7912542,"mean":6.6949158185663,"rank":768407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7112383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7912542,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263160,"mean":11.527238923996,"rank":37897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":224321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263160,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111211,"mean":10.316524125528,"rank":16920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":93977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111211,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4584,"mean":11.597694086843,"rank":743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3813,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4584,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"reddit":[{"title":"Digital Evaluation of Orbital Cyst Associated with Microphthalmos: Characteristics and Their Relationship with Orbital Volume","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/citral\/comments\/4oke0j\/digital_evaluation_of_orbital_cyst_associated\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[8840507],"posted_on":"2016-06-17T17:38:27+00:00","author":{"name":"officialcitral","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/citral","image":"http:\/\/a.thumbs.redditmedia.com\/gq9561mrzeY9TrVx.png","id_on_source":"citral","followers":21,"subreddit":"Centre for Investigative Research and Learning"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BioResearch\/statuses\/744144771568918528","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8840507],"posted_on":"2016-06-18T12:28:33+00:00","author":{"name":"BioInformatics","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_0_normal.png","id_on_source":"BioResearch","tweeter_id":"3007985099","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5},"tweet_id":"744144771568918528"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AHA1R\/statuses\/744193767956152320","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8840507],"posted_on":"2016-06-18T15:43:15+00:00","author":{"name":"\u262c Richard Allen","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/900084508854108161\/4bhBJekI_normal.jpg","description":"#IamRomani #Palestine #Libya #Bahrain #Educator American in Indonesia.
