This new ligand forms a \u03ba(P), \u03ba(2)(NN) dimeric complex with copper(I) (7) that dissociates into a cationic \u03ba(3)(PNN) monomeric complex upon addition of a neutral ligand {[1a\u00b7CuL]OTf (8a-e): L = PPh3 (a), P(OPh)3 (b), 2,6-lutidine (c), 4-DMAP (d), 1-methylimidazole (e)}. The P-Cu bond lengths in 8 are influenced by the \u03c0-accepting\/\u03c3-donating properties of L, and this can be observed by changes in the \u03b4(31)PP\u2550C NMR shift. The donor-acceptor properties in complexes of type 8 have also been investigated by UV\/vis spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Spencer C.
