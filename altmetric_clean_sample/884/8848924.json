The purpose of Study 1 was to provide normative data in the adult French-Quebec population (Canada) for semantic verbal fluency (animals), for two sets of phonemic verbal fluency (TNP and PFL), and for letter P alone (60\u00a0seconds per category\/letter). The objectives of Study 2 were to establish the diagnostic and predictive validity of the present tasks and normative data in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and major depressive episode (MDE).\nThe normative sample consisted of 932 participants aged 19-91\u00a0years. Based on multiple linear regressions, equations to calculate Z-scores were provided. To assess validity, performance of 62 healthy participants was compared to 62 participants with AD and 41 with MDE aged over 50.\nAge and education, but not gender, predicted performance on each verbal fluency task. Healthy adults aged 50 and younger had a better performance on semantic than phonemic verbal fluency. In comparison to MDE, AD participants had lower performance on animals and TNP, but not on letter P. Ninety percent of people with a Z-score\u00a0\u2264\u00a0-1.50 on semantic verbal fluency had AD and the global accuracy was 76.6%. Test-retest reliability over one year was high for both animals (r\u00a0=\u00a0.711) and TNP (r\u00a0=\u00a0.790) in healthy older participants, but dropped for animals in people with AD (r\u00a0=\u00a0.493).\nThese data will strengthen accurate detection of verbal fluency deficits in French-Quebec adults.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d83cf058f610001377","authors":["St-Hilaire, Alexandre","Hudon, Carol","Vallet, Guillaume T","Bherer, Louis","Lussier, Maxime","Gagnon, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois","Simard, Martine","Gosselin, Nadia","Escudier, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique","Rouleau, Isabelle","Macoir, Jo\u00ebl","Alexandre St-Hilaire"],"doi":"10.1080\/13854046.2016.1195014","endpage":"25","first_seen_on":"2016-06-18T04:09:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-4144","1385-4046"],"journal":"The Clinical Neuropsychologist","last_mentioned_on":1467134977,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27279436","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/13854046.2016.1195014","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/13854046.2016.1195014?ai=28w&mi=6uzmnw&af=R"],"pmid":"27279436","pubdate":"2016-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["psychology","neurology"],"title":"Normative data for phonemic and semantic verbal fluency test in the adult French\u2013Quebec population and validation study in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and depression","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/normative-data-phonemic-semantic-verbal-fluency-test-adult-frenchquebec-population-validation-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7958342,"mean":6.7226589717569,"rank":855919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7091252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7958342,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263656,"mean":11.530878208264,"rank":41802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":221030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263656,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":303,"mean":3.3643112582781,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":303,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.2659090909091,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Neuroscience":3,"Psychology":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Normative data for phonemic and semantic verbal fluency test in the adult French-Quebec population and validation study in Alzheimer's disease and depression.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=26942971962&p=1pl&v=1&x=5m2nJhvMq42wxhr7LBbc-A","license":"public","citation_ids":[8848924,8848924],"posted_on":"2016-06-17T23:14:21+00:00","summary":"St-Hilaire A, Hudon C, Vallet GT, Bherer L, Lussier M, Gagnon JF, Simard M, Gosselin N, Escudier F, Rouleau I, Macoir J.","author":{"name":"Alzforum","url":"http:\/\/www.alzforum.org","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/355\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-04-08_at_12.16.09_1.png?1428491784"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/747844416186945536","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8848924],"posted_on":"2016-06-28T17:29:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":979},"tweet_id":"747844416186945536"}]}}
