While the concentration of fluoride in artificially fluoridated water (1 mg Fl-1) is generally considered to be \"safe\", levels of fluoride present in a number of widely used dental health products, such as fluoride-containing toothpaste, appear to be potentially mutagenic. Since fluoride is increasingly being used as a drug, and contamination of the total environment by fluoride emissions and solid wastes from industry is a growing problem, a review of the evidence regarding the potential mutagenicity of fluoride may be in order.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034e7","authors":["Smith, G E"],"first_seen_on":"2016-06-18T03:06:24+00:00","issns":["0048-9697"],"journal":"Science of the Total Environment","last_mentioned_on":1466294553,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3283934"],"pmid":"3283934","pubdate":"1988-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Is fluoride a mutagen?","type":"article","volume":"68"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7917108,"mean":6.6979661075636,"rank":4152450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2208201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7917108,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263226,"mean":11.52803188147,"rank":142772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":94246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263226,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4873,"mean":4.8836912972085,"rank":3129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4873,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":217,"mean":6.0939259259259,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":217,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Mcintyr8Mike\/statuses\/743921082051268609","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8847020],"posted_on":"2016-06-17T21:39:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Michael R.
