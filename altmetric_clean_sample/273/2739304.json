The patient underwent right hemicolectomy and postoperatively received chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide and subsequent high-dose induction chemotherapy, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. Following this treatment, there was a complete remission. Currently, thirthy months after treatment, the patient is in unmaintained complete remission. Comparative exome sequencing of germline DNA and DNA from the two separate malignant components revealed six somatic changes in cancer consensus genes. Both components shared somatic mutations in Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), B-cell CLL\/lymphoma 9 (BCL9) and Forkhead Box P1 (FOXP1) genes. Mutation in SWI\/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 4 (SMARCA4) was only found in the neuroendocrine carcinoma component. The finding of several identical somatic mutations in both components supports a clonal relationship between the neuroendocrine carcinoma and the adenocarcinoma. We suggest that a mutation in SMARCA4 could be responsible for the transformation of the adenocarcinoma component into the neuroendocrine phenotype.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a66","authors":["Leen Vanacker","Dominiek Smeets","Anne Hoorens","Erik Teugels","Roberto Algaba","Marie Fran\u00e7oise Dehou","Ann DE Becker","Diether Lambrechts","Jacques DE Greve"],"first_seen_on":"2014-10-03T12:05:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-7530"],"issue":"10","journal":"Anticancer Research: International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1412337865,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25275049?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25275049","pubdate":"2014-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma of the colon: molecular pathogenesis and treatment.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mixed-adenoneuroendocrine-carcinoma-colon-molecular-pathogenesis-treatment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4325517,"mean":4.9548443995367,"rank":3406676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":125764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4325517,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115723,"mean":7.944766111889,"rank":90021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115723,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1239,"mean":2.4550226171244,"rank":771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":89,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1239,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":0.97280701754386,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
