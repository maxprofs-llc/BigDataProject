Here, we examine if tumor suppressor microRNAs\u00a0(miRNAs) are silenced in a similar manner. Real\u2011time quantitative PCR\u00a0(RTQ\u2011PCR) was employed to investigate the expression level of four candidate miRNAs in GC tissues\u00a0(n=30) and cell lines. Basing on RTQ\u2011PCR results and bioinformatics approach, miR\u20119 was chosen for further study on epigenetic regulation. Bisulfite genomic sequencing PCR\u00a0(BSP) was performed to assess the methylation status of miR\u20119 in GC tissues. In both GC cell lines and animal models, demethylation was performed either by treatment with 5\u2011aza\u20112'\u2011deoxycytidine\u00a0(5\u2011AZA\u2011CdR) or by siRNA targeting DNMT1. We also analyzed the relationship between miRNAs and several clinicopathological features. Candidate miRNAs\u00a0(miR\u20119, miR\u2011433, miR\u201119b, and miR\u2011370) were found strongly downregulated in GC tissues and cell lines. Their expression was increased following 5\u2011AZA\u2011CdR treatment. CpG island methylation of miR\u20119 was significantly higher in GC tissues compared to normal controls. After two demethylation treatments, miR\u20119 methylation degree was significantly decreased and miR\u20119 expression was ob-viously restored in GC cells and animal models. Deregulation of miR\u20119 was positively correlated with tumor lesion size. Three other miRNAs, miR\u201119b, miR\u2011433, and miR\u2011370 were ass\u03bfciated with lymph node metastasis, decreased curvature, and poorly differentiated carcinoma. miR\u201119b and miR\u2011433 were positively correlated with male gender. Of four candidate miRNAs downregulated in GC, miR\u20119 is epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation both\u00a0in\u00a0vitro and\u00a0in\u00a0vivo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007977","authors":["Yan Li","Zhong Xu","Bo Li","Zhengzheng Zhang","Hongchun Luo","Yuanhu Wang","Zhizhong Lu","Xiaoling Wu"],"doi":"10.3892\/ijo.2014.2667","first_seen_on":"2014-10-02T12:00:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-2423"],"journal":"International Journal of Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1412265125,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25270964?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25270964","pubdate":"2014-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Epigenetic silencing of miRNA\u20119 is correlated with promoter\u2011proximal CpG island hypermethylation in gastric cancer\u00a0in\u00a0vitro and\u00a0in\u00a0vivo.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epigenetic-silencing-mirna9-correlated-promoterproximal-cpg-island-hypermethylation-gastric-cancer-v"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2294572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1620503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119550,"mean":8.1417389187699,"rank":57978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":48795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119550,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1049,"mean":1.9466851145038,"rank":446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1049,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":0.94788461538462,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
