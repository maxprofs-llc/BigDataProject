However, this possibility has not been examined. Here, we demonstrate that HD patient-derived fibroblasts can be directly trans-differentiated into neuron-like cells by knockdown of the expression of a single gene encoding the polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein. The directly converted HD neuron-like cells were positive in expression of Tuj1, NeuN, DARPP-32, and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid and exhibited neuritic breakdown, abnormal neuritic branching, increased cell death, and aggregation of mutant huntingtin. These observations indicate that the neuron-like cells directly converted from HD patient fibroblasts recapitulate the major aspects of neuropathological characteristics of HD and thus provide an additional model for understanding the disorder and validation of therapeutic reagents.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yanying Liu","Yuanchao Xue","Samantha Ridley","Dong Zhang","Khosrow Rezvani","Xiang-Dong Fu","Hongmin Wang"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0109621","first_seen_on":"2014-10-03T08:48:05+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"10","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1412374634,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0109621","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0109621","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0109621"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0109621.pdf","pmid":"25275533","pubdate":"2014-10-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e109621","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Direct Reprogramming of Huntington\u2019s Disease Patient Fibroblasts into Neuron-Like Cells Leads to Abnormal Neurite Outgrowth, Increased Cell Death, and Aggregate Formation","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/direct-reprogramming-huntingtons-disease-patient-fibroblasts-neuronlike-cells-leads-abnormal-neurite"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":1858617,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2594173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119786,"mean":8.3303740702095,"rank":44525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":73541,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119786,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80038,"mean":8.426538700851,"rank":32156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":47208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80038,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2511,"mean":15.722646215139,"rank":1184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":1299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2511,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
