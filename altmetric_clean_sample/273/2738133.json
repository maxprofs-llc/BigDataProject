In an attempt to formulate treatment guidelines, we present a review of 152 cases of post-traumatic craniofacial deformities treated by us using different surgical techniques. Analysis of the underlying bony and soft tissue deficits was followed by stepwise reassembly of the skeletal fragments and re-establishment of facial contour and symmetry. The postoperative outcomes were evaluated in terms of aesthetic and functional parameters. Though all patients had considerable improvement after secondary correction of these deformities, soft tissue deficits and time elapsed till secondary reconstruction remain the major factors in achieving an ideal aesthetic outcome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c24","doi":"10.1097\/scs.0000000000001138","first_seen_on":"2014-10-03T02:27:17+00:00","issns":["1049-2275"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Craniofacial Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1412303197,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/Abstract\/2014\/09000\/Secondary_Correction_of_Post_traumatic.19.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/2014\/09000\/Secondary_Correction_of_Post_traumatic.19.pdf","pmid":"25148630","pubdate":"2014-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1658","subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Secondary Correction of Post-traumatic Craniofacial Deformities","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/secondary-correction-posttraumatic-craniofacial-deformities-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4325563,"mean":4.9529313369874,"rank":3406507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":125736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4325563,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115723,"mean":7.9346515442181,"rank":89951,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115723,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2487,"mean":1.1832839903459,"rank":2204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2487,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153,"mean":1.1361842105263,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JCSOnline1\/status\/517863262939906048","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2738133],"posted_on":"2014-10-03T02:26:37+00:00","author":{"name":"JCS Online","url":"http:\/\/www.jcraniofacialsurgery.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1397343347\/JCranioSurg_square_normal.jpg","description":"The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery serves as a forum of communication for all those involved in craniofacial and maxillofacial surgery.","id_on_source":"JCSOnline1","tweeter_id":"317871694","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":118},"tweet_id":"517863262939906048"}]}}
