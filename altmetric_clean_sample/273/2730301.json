A detailed analysis of Wnt signaling in a human brain endothelial cell line indicates that expression and function of P-glycoprotein, a major efflux transporter, is controlled by non-canonical Wnt signaling. Inhibition of this pathway leads to downregulation of P-glycoprotein and increased transcellular drug transport and reveals a potential strategy for improving drug delivery for treatment of neurologic diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce7","authors":["Lester R Drewes"],"doi":"10.1038\/jcbfm.2014.98","endpage":"1257","first_seen_on":"2014-10-01T03:22:39+00:00","issns":["0271-678X","1559-7016"],"journal":"Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1412133710,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/jcbfm\/journal\/v34\/n8\/full\/jcbfm201498a.html"],"pmid":"24896568","pubdate":"2014-06-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1257","subjects":["metabolism","brain"],"title":"Frizzled fissure to improve central nervous system drug delivery|[quest]|","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/frizzled-fissure-improve-central-nervous-system-drug-delivery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3054983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928043,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119703,"mean":8.2645112028207,"rank":78245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":28091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119703,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":874,"mean":4.873489117984,"rank":622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":874,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":8.4337021276596,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
