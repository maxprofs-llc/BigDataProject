The resource allocation (C, N and P) between cluster roots and nodules has been largely understudied during P-deficient conditions. The aim of this investigation was therefore to determine the changes in resource allocation between these organs during fluctuations in P supply. Lupinus albus was cultivated in sand culture for 3 weeks, with either sufficient (2 mM high) or limiting (0.1 mM low) P supply. Although variation on P supply had no effect on the total biomass, there were significant differences in specialised below-ground organ allocation to cluster roots and nodule formation. Cluster root formation and the associated C-costs increased during low P supply, but at sufficient P-supply the construction and growth respiration costs of cluster roots declined along with their growth. In contrast to the cluster root decline at high P supply, there was an increase in nodule growth allocation and corresponding C-costs. However, this was not associated with an increase in BNF. Since cluster roots were able to increase P acquisition under low P conditions, this below-ground investment may also have benefited the P nutrition of nodules. These findings provide evidence that when lupins acquire N via BNF in their nodules, there may be a trade-off in resource allocation between cluster roots and nodules.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ed1","authors":["Thuynsma R","Valentine A","Kleinert A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jplph.2013.09.001","first_seen_on":"2014-10-01T11:19:19+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Plant Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1412162344,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24129121?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24129121","pubdate":"2013-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Phosphorus deficiency affects the allocation of below-ground resources to combined cluster roots and nodules in Lupinus albus.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phosphorus-deficiency-affects-allocation-belowground-resources-combined-cluster-roots-nodules-lupinu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4319059,"mean":4.9657416579038,"rank":3405964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":125746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4319059,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115508,"mean":7.929737799441,"rank":90215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115508,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":321,"mean":1.2975,"rank":213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":321,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.62325,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
