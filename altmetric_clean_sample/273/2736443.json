ILs have been shown to evolve under positive selection; however, little information exists regarding which codons are specifically selected. By using different codon-based maximum-likelihood (ML) approaches, signatures of positive selection in mammalian ILs were searched for. Sequences of 46 ILs were retrieved from publicly available databases of mammalian genomes to detect signatures of positive selection in individual codons. Evolutionary analyses were conducted under two ML frameworks, the HyPhy package implemented in the Data Monkey Web Server and CODEML implemented in PAML. Signatures of positive selection were found in 28 ILs: IL-1A and B; IL-2, IL-4 to IL-10, IL-12A and B; IL-14 to IL-17A and C; IL-18, IL-20 to IL-22, IL-25, IL-26, IL-27B, IL-31, IL-34, IL-36A; and G. Codons under positive selection varied between 1 and 15. No evidence of positive selection was detected in IL-13; IL-17B and F; IL-19, IL-23, IL-24, IL-27A; or IL-29. Most mammalian ILs have sites evolving under positive selection, which may be explained by the multitude of biological processes in which ILs are enrolled. The results obtained raise hypotheses concerning the ILs functions, which should be pursued by using mutagenesis and crystallographic approaches.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d79","authors":["Fabiana Neves","Joana Abrantes","John W Steinke","Pedro J Esteves"],"doi":"10.1177\/1753425913486687","first_seen_on":"2014-10-02T15:34:57+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1753-4267"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Endotoxin Research","last_mentioned_on":1412264016,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23775092?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23775092","pubdate":"2014-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["bacteriology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Maximum-likelihood approaches reveal signatures of positive selection in IL genes in mammals.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/maximumlikelihood-approaches-reveal-signatures-positive-selection-il-genes-mammals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4323244,"mean":4.9563124503167,"rank":3406193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":125797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4323244,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115447,"mean":7.8878665696517,"rank":89845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115447,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139,"mean":1.3924782608696,"rank":103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.6714285714286,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
