Although there have been many reports of self-mutilation injuries in the literature, none have reported self-cannibalism after self-mutilation. In this article we present a patient with self-cannibalism following self-mutilation. A 34-year-old male patient was brought to the emergency department from the prison with a laceration on the right leg. Physical examination revealed a well-demarcated rectangular soft tissue defect on his right thigh. The prison authorities stated that the prisoner had cut his thigh with a knife and had eaten the flesh.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008cc9","authors":["Atakan Yilmaz","Emrah Uyanik","Melike C.
