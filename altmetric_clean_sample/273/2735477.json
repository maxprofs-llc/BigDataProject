Ticks and tick-borne diseases (TTBDs) affect 80% of the world cattle population and are widely distributed throughout the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical countries including India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Ticks and tick-transmitted infections have coevolved with various wild animal hosts, which constitute the reservoir hosts for ticks and tick-borne pathogens of livestock, pets, and humans. In this region, the livestock sector is suffering from a number of disease problems caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Among the parasitological problems, the damage caused by TTBDs is considered very high, and the control of TTBDs has been given priority.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003294","authors":["Srikant Ghosh","Gyan Chand Bansal","Suresh Chandra Gupta","Debdatta Ray","Muhammad Qasim Khan","Hamid Irshad","Md Shahiduzzaman","Ulrike Seitzer","Jabbar S Ahmed"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00436-007-0684-7","first_seen_on":"2014-10-02T10:29:55+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0932-0113"],"journal":"Parasitology Research","last_mentioned_on":1412245763,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17823830"],"pmid":"17823830","pubdate":"2007-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Status of tick distribution in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.","type":"article","volume":"101 Suppl 2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/status-tick-distribution-bangladesh-india-pakistan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4323244,"mean":4.9563124503167,"rank":3406314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":125810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4323244,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115447,"mean":7.8899020840914,"rank":89885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115447,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1030,"mean":1.952925170068,"rank":693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1030,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":0.88591780821918,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
