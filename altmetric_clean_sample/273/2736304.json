The cooling of the daughter ions at a few K allows its characterization not only through its fragmentation pattern but also through its well resolved electronic spectroscopy. The proof of principle of the method is demonstrated on the photofragment resulting from C\u03b1-C\u03b2 bond rupture in protonated tyrosine (TyrH(+)). The analysis of the daughter ion (m\/z 108) photofragmentation spectrum is in agreement with the proposed mechanism implying a proton transfer to the phenyl ring as the first step of the fragmentation mechanism of TyrH(+).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cee","authors":["Claude Dedonder","Claude Dedonder","G\u00e9raldine F\u00e9raud","Christophe Jouvet"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4896981","first_seen_on":"2014-10-02T14:57:02+00:00","issns":["1089-7690"],"journal":"Journal of Chemical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1413030742,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aip\/journal\/jcp\/141\/13\/10.1063\/1.4896981","http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aip\/journal\/jcp\/141\/13\/10.1063\/1.4896981?TRACK=RSS"],"pmid":"25296774","pubdate":"2014-10-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AIP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Communication: Identification of daughter ions through their electronic spectroscopy at low temperature","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/communication-identification-daughter-ions-through-electronic-spectroscopy-low-temperature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4353686,"mean":4.8872118172172,"rank":3408215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":126774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4353686,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116061,"mean":7.6901898673101,"rank":88813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116061,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3696,"mean":2.0495967523681,"rank":2157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3696,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228,"mean":2.763718061674,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
