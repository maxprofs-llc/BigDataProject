The authors examined effects of medication adherence in the first 90 days after a psychiatric hospitalization among 1,367 adults with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder served by the public behavioral health systems of Miami-Dade County and Pinellas County in Florida. Better adherence was associated with lower subsequent criminal justice costs and greater use of treatment services. A modest investment in promoting treatment participation and medication adherence may reduce criminal justice involvement and costs for persons with serious mental illness.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c6a","authors":["Allison G.
