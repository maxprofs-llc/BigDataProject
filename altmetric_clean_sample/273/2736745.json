According to a crossover protocol (1-month washout), a combination of dexmedetomidine (40\u00a0\u03bcg\/kg) and buprenorphine (20\u00a0\u03bcg\/kg) was given OTM (buccal cavity) or i.m. (quadriceps muscle) in six female neutered cats. Plasma samples were collected through a jugular catheter during a 24-h period. Plasma dexmedetomidine and buprenorphine concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma concentration-time data were fitted to compartmental models. For dexmedetomidine and buprenorphine, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax ) were significantly lower following OTM than following i.m. administration. For buprenorphine, time to reach Cmax was also significantly longer after OTM administration than after i.m. injection. Data suggested that dexmedetomidine (40\u00a0\u03bcg\/kg) combined with buprenorphine (20\u00a0\u03bcg\/kg) is not as well absorbed from the buccal mucosa site as from the intramuscular injection site.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f8e","authors":["Porters N","de Rooster H","Bosmans T","Baert K","Cherlet M","Croubels S","De Backer P","Polis I","Porters, N.","Rooster, H.","Bosmans, T.","Baert, K.","Cherlet, M.","Croubels, S.","De Backer, P.","Polis, I."],"doi":"10.1111\/jvp.12172","endpage":"208","first_seen_on":"2014-10-02T17:04:14+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-5984361","handles":["1854\/LU-5984361"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2885","0140-7783","01407783"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Veterinary Pharmacology & Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1413110282,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jvp.12172\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/jvp.12172"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jvp.12172\/pdf","pmid":"25269566","pubdate":"2014-09-30T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"203","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Pharmacokinetics of oral transmucosal and intramuscular dexmedetomidine combined with buprenorphine in cats","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacokinetics-oral-transmucosal-intramuscular-dexmedetomidine-combined-buprenorphine-cats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6340407,"mean":5.9774305285816,"rank":2958701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3357281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6340407,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161128,"mean":8.1829190017814,"rank":80809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":79395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161128,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":1.6691275167785,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.35,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1},"mendeley":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/_SEAAV\/status\/521248419512598528","license":"datasift","rt":["Albinovet"],"citation_ids":[2736745],"posted_on":"2014-10-12T10:38:02+00:00","author":{"name":"SEAAV","url":"http:\/\/www.seaav.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/658251843802431488\/oOSDpUkz_normal.jpg","description":"Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Anestesia y Analgesia Veterinaria.
