The prevalence of cardiac disease is unknown.\nTo describe the prevalence and patterns of cardiac disease in patients attending the first cardiology service of Timor-Leste.\nA cross-sectional retrospective analysis was performed of demographic and clinical data of 474 unique patients referred to outpatient cardiology clinics conducted in East Timor from 2003-2016.\nMean age was 29.9\u2009\u00b1\u200918.5 years, with females significantly younger than males (28.8\u2009\u00b1\u200916.9 years vs 32.3\u2009\u00b1\u200920.6 years). Congenital cardiac disease patients were the youngest (15.5\u2009\u00b1\u200913.9 years) and cardiomyopathy patients the oldest (46.7\u2009\u00b1\u200917.8 years). Of patients with rheumatic heart disease, the majority had mitral stenosis (59.4%) and multi-valvular involvement (61.6%). Of note, 28.3% of patients with rheumatic heart disease presented with severe mitral stenosis. Amongst congenital heart disease patients, the most common diagnosis (61%) was septal defect. 19.2% of patients either required immediate referral for intervention, or palliation for their cardiac disease. Patients referred to Australia for treatment were significantly younger (19.7\u2009\u00b1\u200911.7 years) than all other outcome groups.\nAmongst young East Timorese, rheumatic heart disease and unrepaired congenital cardiac defects impose a significant burden. One-fifth of patients present to clinic with severe disease requiring urgent referral for surgery or palliation..","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002afe","authors":["Paratz, Elizabeth D","Bayley, Noel"],"doi":"10.1111\/imj.13381","first_seen_on":"2017-03-02T12:24:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["14440903","1445-5994"],"journal":"Internal Medicine Journal","last_mentioned_on":1489556761,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/imj.13381\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/imj.13381\/pdf","pmid":"28145049","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Heart disease in East Timor : cross-sectional analysis of 474 patients attending Timor-Leste's first cardiology service","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/imj.13381","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/heart-disease-east-timor-crosssectional-analysis-474-patients-attending-timorlestes-first-cardiology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.9,"score_history":{"1y":4.9,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":1705420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6651083,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243299,"mean":13.729409440275,"rank":69837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":173269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243299,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":885,"mean":4.9221832579186,"rank":193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":885,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":3.0222962962963,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
