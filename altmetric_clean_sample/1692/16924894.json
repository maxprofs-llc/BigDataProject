Real-time microscopic observations clarified a change in both the surface area and internal volume of vesicles during fusion. We also determined the optimal cholesterol concentrations and temperature for inducing fusion. The mechanism of fusion can be attributed to a change in membrane tension, which is caused by the solubilization of lipids through the isomerization of AzoTAB. We used a micropipette technique to measure membrane tension, and discuss the mechanism of fusion in terms of membrane elastic energy. The obtained results regarding this novel photo-induced fusion could lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of membrane fusion in living cells and may also see wider applications, such as in drug delivery and biomimetic material design.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fd3","authors":["Yui Suzuki","Ken H.
