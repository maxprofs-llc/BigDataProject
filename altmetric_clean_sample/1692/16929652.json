Deoxydehydration (DODH) enables the direct transformation of two adjacent hydroxyl groups into a double bond. Supported molybdenum-based catalysts were utilized for the first time in DODH. MoOx\/TiO2 possesses superior catalytic activity compared to common molybdenum salts. The catalyst efficiently converted 1,4-anhydroerythritol into 2,5 dihydrofuran in the presence of 3-octanol as reducing agent showing high reproducibility and stability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e64","authors":["Sandbrink, Lennart","Beckerle, Klaus","Meiners, Isabell","Liffmann, Rebecca","Rahimi, Khosrow","Okuda, Jun","Palkovits, Regina"],"doi":"10.1002\/cssc.201700010","first_seen_on":"2017-03-02T13:26:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["18645631","1864-564X"],"journal":"ChemSusChem","last_mentioned_on":1488451450,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201700010\/abstract;jsessionid=7EB774172DCB11EF7A0B4A299B1F5ACF.f01t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201700010\/pdf","pmid":"28165202","pubdate":"2017-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Energy","Materials Science","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Supported molybdenum catalysts for the deoxydehydration of 1,4-anhydroerythritol into 2,5 dihydrofuran","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/cssc.201700010","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/supported-molybdenum-catalysts-deoxydehydration-14anhydroerythritol-25dihydrofuran"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":6294835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1122378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242164,"mean":13.706621721732,"rank":176483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242164,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1825,"mean":2.8317620614035,"rank":935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1825,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144,"mean":4.8052447552448,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
