The proposed system \ufb01rstly extracts approximate entropy (ApEn)featuresfrom\ufb01xedslidingwindowsonreal-timesteeringwheelanglestimeseries. Afterthat, this system linearizes the ApEn features series through an adaptive piecewise linear \ufb01tting using a given deviation. Then, the detection system calculates the warping distance between the linear features series of the sample data. Finally, this system uses the warping distance to determine the drowsiness state of the driver according to a designed binary decision classi\ufb01er. The experimental data were collected from 14.68 h driving under real road conditions, including two fatigue levels: \"wake\" and \"drowsy\". The results show that the proposed system is capable of working online with an average 78.01% accuracy, 29.35% false detections of the \"awake\" state, and 15.15% false detections of the \"drowsy\" state. The results also con\ufb01rm that the proposed method based on SWA signal is valuable for applications in preventing traf\ufb01c accidents caused by driver fatigue.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Zuojin Li","Shengbo Li","Renjie Li","Bo Cheng","Jinliang Shi"],"doi":"10.3390\/s17030495","first_seen_on":"2017-03-02T12:40:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"3","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1488445160,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/3\/495?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/3\/495\/pdf","pmid":"28257094","pubdate":"2017-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Online Detection of Driver Fatigue Using Steering Wheel Angles for Real Driving Conditions","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/online-detection-driver-fatigue-using-steering-wheel-angles-real-driving-conditions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":7173880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242164,"mean":13.706635348917,"rank":201471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242164,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3420,"mean":1.9640737057619,"rank":2393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3420,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":608,"mean":1.3498945634267,"rank":315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":608,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":4,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/837225799572807681","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16924624],"posted_on":"2017-03-02T08:59:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/913708571468210177\/oIecAg-R_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
