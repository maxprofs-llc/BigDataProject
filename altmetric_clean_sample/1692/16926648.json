This cluster-randomized controlled trial aimed to test the effects of micronutrient-fortified milk in Chinese students. Participants received either micronutrient-fortified (n = 177) or unfortified (n = 183) milk for six months. Academic performance, motivation, and learning strategies were estimated by end-of-term tests and the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. Blood samples were analyzed for micronutrients. In total, 296 students (82.2%) completed this study. Compared with the control group, students in the intervention group reported higher scores in several academic subjects (p < 0.05), including languages, mathematics, ethics, and physical performance at the end of follow-up. Students in the intervention group showed greater self-efficacy and use of cognitive strategies in learning, and reported less test anxiety (p < 0.001). Moreover, vitamin B2 deficiency (odds ratio (OR) = 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.11~0.30) and iron deficiency (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.14~0.81) were less likely in the students of the intervention group, whereas vitamin D, vitamin B12, and selenium deficiencies were not significantly different. \"Cognitive strategy\" had a partial mediating effect on the test scores of English (95% CI: 1.26~3.79) and Chinese (95% CI: 0.53~2.21). Our findings suggest that micronutrient-fortified milk may improve students' academic performance, motivation, and learning strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6573cf058f610009228","authors":["Xiaoqin Wang","Zhaozhao Hui","Xiaoling Dai","Paul Terry","Yue Zhang","Mei Ma","Mingxu Wang","Fu Deng","Wei Gu","Shuangyan Lei","Ling Li","Mingyue Ma","Bin Zhang"],"doi":"10.3390\/nu9030226","first_seen_on":"2017-03-02T13:06:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2072-6643"],"issue":"3","journal":"Nutrients","last_mentioned_on":1505302898,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/9\/3\/226?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/9\/3\/226","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/nu9030226","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28257107?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/9\/3\/226\/pdf","pmid":"28257107","pubdate":"2017-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Micronutrient\u2010Fortified\u00a0Milk\u00a0and\u00a0Academic\u00a0 Performance\u00a0among\u00a0Chinese\u00a0Middle\u00a0School\u00a0Students:\u00a0 A\u00a0Cluster\u2010Randomized\u00a0Controlled\u00a0Trial","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/micronutrientfortified-milk-academic-performance-among-chinese-middle-school-students-clusterrandomi-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.5,"score_history":{"1y":7.5,"6m":2.2,"3m":1.35,"1m":1.35,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409376,"mean":7.0790526953473,"rank":1183977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":7219253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409376,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244207,"mean":13.74457782364,"rank":53141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":190882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244207,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2697,"mean":15.20628189911,"rank":850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":1843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2697,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300,"mean":11.364046822742,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1,"practitioner":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NZ":1,"CH":1,"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/837242784683732992","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16926648],"posted_on":"2017-03-02T10:06:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/891043583511470080\/FfBKDjay_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
