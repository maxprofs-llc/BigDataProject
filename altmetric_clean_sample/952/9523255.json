Participants were more likely to breastfeed if they had some college education, were unemployed or employed full-time, had only one child, and had been breastfed themselves as infants. Barriers to prolonged breastfeeding included limited support after hospital discharge, pain, and perceived insufficient milk supply. Participants in this study had higher breastfeeding initiation and in-hospital exclusivity rates after improvement of in-hospital breastfeeding support.\nClients of WIC initiated breastfeeding at a high rate but either supplemented with formula or stopped breastfeeding for reasons that could be remedied by improved prenatal education, encouragement of exclusive breastfeeding in the hospital, and more outpatient support.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5a13cf058f61000528b","authors":["Onize Oniwon","Jennifer A.F.
