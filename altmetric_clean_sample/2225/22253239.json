Check it out!"],"citation":{"abstract":"Sacral and peripheral neuromodulation are minimally invasive surgical procedures that are third-line therapy options for the treatment of patients with idiopathic overactive bladder syndrome. There has been interest in their efficacy in the management of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD). Contemporary data suggest promising outcomes for urinary and bowel symptoms in carefully selected patients with spinal cord injury and\/or multiple sclerosis. This article reviews the current literature regarding urinary and bowel outcomes in patients with NLUTD and also discusses contemporary studies that suggest that treatment during particular stages of neurologic injury may prevent long-term urinary sequelae.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c41","authors":["Barboglio Romo, Paholo G.","Gupta, Priyanka","Paholo G.
