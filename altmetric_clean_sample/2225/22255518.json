As CLD transfers from soil to animals mainly via involuntary ingestion, the consumption of foodstuffs derived from animals raised in contaminated areas may significantly contribute to exposure of humans to CLD. The present study was designed to test the efficacy of two different activated carbons (ACs) sources in limiting CLD transfer from soil to animal. Three soils (ASs) were prepared according to the OECD guideline 207. One standard soil (SS) lacking AC, and two modified preparations of SS supplemented with 2% coconut-based activated carbon (ORBO), SSO or with 2% lignite-based one (DARCO), SSD. All three soils were spiked with 10 \u03bcg of kepone per g of dry matter and aged for three weeks. This study involved 15 goat kids randomly assigned to the 3 experimental groups (n = 5\/group), which were fed the experimental matrices at an exposure dose of 10 \u03bcg CLD per kg of body weight per day. After 21 d of oral exposure, CLD in adipose tissue and liver were analysed by LC-MS-MS. A significant decrease of 63.7% and 74.7% of CLD concentrations in adipose tissue and liver, respectively, were obtained from animals exposed using SS containing DARCO as compared to those receiving only SS. Decreases in CLD levels of 98.2% (adipose tissue) and 98.7% (liver) were obtained for animals exposed using SS containing ORBO. This study leads us to conclude that (i) the presence of AC in CLD-contaminated soil strongly reduces CLD bioavailability, and (ii) the efficacy depends on the nature and characteristics of the AC used.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yehya, Sarah","Delannoy, Matthieu","Fournier, Agn\u00e8s","Baroudi, Moomen","Rychen, Guido","Feidt, Cyril"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0179548","first_seen_on":"2017-07-21T13:43:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1500642488,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28723966?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28723966","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science (PLoS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Activated carbon, a useful medium to bind chlordecone in soil and limit its transfer to growing goat kids","type":"article","volume":"12"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250684,"mean":6.9709404952229,"rank":7136035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250684,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167717,"mean":11.661816809368,"rank":136809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167717,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114254,"mean":10.586747866577,"rank":96407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114254,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2750,"mean":9.4132280829392,"rank":2149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2750,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/goat_papers\/statuses\/888385102933131266","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22255518],"posted_on":"2017-07-21T13:08:08+00:00","author":{"name":"goatpapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/558367908275822592\/MZjFXuZV_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"goat_papers","tweeter_id":"2992530750","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":50},"tweet_id":"888385102933131266"}]}}
