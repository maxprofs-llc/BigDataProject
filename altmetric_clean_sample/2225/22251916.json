All cattle were individually fed diets with 28% to 72% corn cobs in addition to either alfalfa, corn silage, or sorghum silage at 18% to 60% of the diet (DM basis). The remainder of the diet consisted of protein supplement. Source of protein within the supplement varied and included urea, blood meal, corn gluten meal, dry distillers grains, feather meal, meat and bone meal, poultry by-product meal, soybean meal, and wet distillers grains. All trials included a urea-only treatment. Intake of all cattle within an experiment was held constant, as a percentage of BW, established by the urea-supplemented group. In each trial the base diet (forage and urea supplement) was MP deficient. Treatments consisted of increasing amounts of test protein replacing the urea supplement. As protein in the diet increased, ADG plateaued. Among experiments, ADG ranged from 0.11 to 0.73 kg. Three methods of calculating microbial efficiency were used to determine MP supply. Gain was then regressed against calculated MP supply to determine MP requirement for maintenance and gain. Method 1 (based on a constant 13% microbial efficiency as used by the beef NRC model) predicted an MP maintenance requirement of 3.8 g\/kg BW and 385 g MP\/kg gain. Method 2 calculated microbial efficiency using low-quality forage diets and predicted MP requirements of 3.2 g\/kg BW for maintenance and 448 g\/kg for gain. Method 3 (based on an equation predicting MCP yield from TDN intake, proposed by the Beef Cattle Nutrient Requirements Model [BCNRM]) predicted MP requirements of 3.1 g\/kg BW for maintenance and 342 g\/kg for gain. The factorial method of calculating MP maintenance requirements accounts for scurf, endogenous urinary, and metabolic fecal protein losses and averaged 4.2 g\/kg BW. Cattle performance data demonstrate formulating diets to meet the beef NRC model recommended MP maintenance requirement (3.8 g\/kg S) works well when using 13% microbial efficiency. Therefore, a change in how microbial efficiency is calculated necessitates a change in the proposed MP maintenance requirement to not oversupply or undersupply RUP. Using the 2016 BCNRM to predict MCP production and formulate diets to meet MP requirements also requires changing the MP maintenance requirement to 3.1 g\/kg BW.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c86","authors":["A.
