The first COF was reported in 2005 with much effort centered on the establishment of new synthetic routes for its preparation. To date, most available synthetic methods for COF synthesis are based on bulk mixing under solvothermal conditions. Therefore, there is increasing interest in developing systematic protocols for COF synthesis that provide for fine control over reaction conditions and improve COF processability on surfaces, which is essential for their use in practical applications. Herein, we present a novel microfluidic-based method for COF synthesis where the reaction between two constituent building blocks, 1,3,5-benzenetricarbaldehyde (BTCA) and 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene (TAPB), takes place under controlled diffusion conditions and at room temperature. Using such an approach yields sponge-like, crystalline fibers of a COF material, hereafter called MF-COF. The mechanical properties of MF-COF and the dynamic nature of the approach allow the continuous production of MF-COF fibers and their direct printing onto surfaces. The general method opens new potential applications requiring advanced printing of 2D or 3D COF structures on flexible or rigid surfaces.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f23","authors":["Afshin Abrishamkar","Afshin Abrishamkar","David Rodr\u00edguez-San-Miguel","David Rodr\u00edguez-San-Miguel","Jorge Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Navarro","Jorge Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Navarro","Romen Rodriguez-Trujillo","Romen Rodriguez-Trujillo","David B.
