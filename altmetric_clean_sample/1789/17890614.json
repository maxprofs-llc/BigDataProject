Smac mimetics are designed to neutralize inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins, thus reactivating the apoptotic program in cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel bivalent Smac mimetic APG-1387 in NPC. In vitro, APG-1387 in combination with TNF-\u03b1 potently decreased NPC cell viability by inducing apoptosis in majority of NPC cell lines. The in vitro antitumor effect was RIPK1-dependent, whereas it was independent on IAPs, USP11, or EBV. Of note, the inhibition of NF-\u03baB or AKT pathway rendered resistant NPC cells responsive to the treatment of APG-1387\/TNF-\u03b1. In vivo, APG-1387 displayed antitumor activity as a single agent at well-tolerated doses, even in an in vitro resistant cell line. In summary, our results demonstrate that APG-1387 exerts a potent antitumor effect on NPC. These findings support clinical evaluation of APG-1387 as a potential treatment for advanced NPC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000249e","authors":["Ning Li","Lin Feng","Hui-Qiong Han","Jing Yuan","Xue-Kang Qi","Yi-Fan Lian","Bo-Hua Kuang","Yu-Chen Zhang","Cheng-Cheng Deng","Hao-Jiong Zhang","You-Yuan Yao","Miao Xu","Gui-Ping He","Bing-Chun Zhao","Ling Gao","Qi-Sheng Feng","Li-Zhen Chen","Lu Yang","Dajun Yang","Yi-Xin Zeng"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.canlet.2016.07.008","first_seen_on":"2017-03-21T21:17:23+00:00","issns":["03043835"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cancer Letters","last_mentioned_on":1492560000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.canlet.2016.07.008"],"pmid":"27424523","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"A novel Smac mimetic APG-1387 demonstrates potent antitumor activity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells by inducing apoptosis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0304383516304025","volume":"381","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-smac-mimetic-apg1387-demonstrates-potent-antitumor-activity-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma-cells-ind"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082745,"mean":6.8630429413494,"rank":4273965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2243568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082745,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236480,"mean":13.34253110847,"rank":134571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":80272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236480,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1892,"mean":3.6471845584347,"rank":1002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1892,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":1.8830882352941,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
