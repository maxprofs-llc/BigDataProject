Generational changes in sexual behavior may have led to an increased incidence of positivity in recent years. HPV positivity in both benign and malignant lesions of the sinonasal cavities has been shown in previous studies (estimates range from 20%-30% for malignancy). We intend to investigate if HPV positivity affected survival outcomes in our patient cohort.\nTwenty-six patients diagnosed pathologically for sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with available archived biopsy specimens were retrospectively analyzed to obtain HPV status using a real-time, multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay that detects and quantifies 15 known high-risk HPV types. Demographic information was collected, and survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier estimation.\nSixteen of 26 (62%) SCC tumors in the patient cohort were positive for HPV DNA. HPV types 16 and 18 were the most common (n = 8 and 2, respectively), although a wide range of HPV types across the 15 tested were positive. Survival analyses showed a statistically significant survival advantage (median survival of 12 vs. 54 months) when accounting for HPV positivity using log-rank testing (P < 0.003).\nHPV positivity appears to be present in a significant proportion of squamous cell carcinoma cases of the nasal cavity. In our limited patient population there does appear to be a survival advantage to HPV positivity. Further prospective, multi-institutional trials with standardized treatment protocols are needed to elucidate the true impact of HPV positivity in this subset of head and neck cancers.\n4.
