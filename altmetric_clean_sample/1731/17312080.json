Cerevisiae","Nice to see that our work on protein disaggregation is out."],"citation":{"abstract":"Protein aggregation is intimately associated with cellular stress and is accelerated during aging, disease and cellular dysfunction. Yeast cells rely on the ATP-consuming chaperone Hsp104 to disaggregate proteins together with Hsp70. Hsp110s are ancient and abundant chaperones that form complexes with Hsp70. Here we provide in vivo data showing that yeast Hsp110s Sse1 and Sse2 are essential for Hsp104-dependent protein disaggregation. Following heat shock, complexes of Hsp110 and Hsp70 are recruited to protein aggregates and functions together with Hsp104 in the disaggregation process. In the absence of Hsp110, Hsp70 and Hsp104 targeting to the aggregates is impaired and the residual Hsp104 that still reaches the aggregates fails to disaggregate. Thus, coordinated activities of both Hsp104 and Hsp110 are required to reactivate aggregated proteins. These findings have important implications for the understanding of how eukaryotic cells manage misfolded and amyloid proteins.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310d","authors":["Jayasankar Mohanakrishnan Kaimal","Ganapathi Kandasamy","Fabian Gasser","Claes Andr\u00e9asson"],"doi":"10.1128\/mcb.00027-17","first_seen_on":"2017-03-13T17:22:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-5549"],"journal":"Molecular & Cellular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1489505558,"links":["http:\/\/mcb.asm.org\/content\/early\/2017\/03\/07\/MCB.00027-17.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/mcb.asm.org\/content\/early\/2017\/03\/07\/MCB.00027-17.full.pdf","pmid":"28289075","pubdate":"2017-03-16T22:23:33+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Coordinated Hsp110 and Hsp104 activities power protein disaggregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coordinated-hsp110-hsp104-activities-power-protein-disaggregation-saccharomyces-cerevisiae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":3523387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4778410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242754,"mean":13.666791273434,"rank":99782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":140530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242754,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3947,"mean":2.9311155600608,"rank":2547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3947,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":4.94125,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
