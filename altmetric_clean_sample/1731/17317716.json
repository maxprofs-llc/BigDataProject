Some of them are associated with increased risk of permanent disability and death. This review highlights a selected group of primary and acquired hematologic disorders that can present as neurologic or neurosurgical emergencies.\nThere is an increasing recognition of the broad neurologic presentations of hematologic disorders. Diagnostic criteria continue to be revised as we learn more about these diseases. Treatment options are varied depending on the hematologic syndrome. Clinical judgment is important on a case by case basis given the complexity of these patients. Early recognition of neurologic manifestations of hematologic disorders is important as emergent treatment may be warranted. Clinical signs, appropriate laboratory testing and progression of disease must be taken into consideration to make a timely and definitive diagnosis which will aid in guiding treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007063","authors":["Martha L.
