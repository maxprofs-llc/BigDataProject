We analyzed data of a cohort of 767 patients attending 1 SCD clinic between 2002 and 2013 and of 235 patients from the other clinic who have had neurovascular imaging between 2007 and 2014.\nWe identified 4 patients in the cohort who had an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage during 9063 patient-years. The highest incidence rate was seen among women in the age group 30 to 39 years with the hemoglobin SS (HbSS) genotype (440 per 100\u2009000 patient-years). Unruptured intracranial aneurysms were found in 20 of the 324 patients, who had imaging data; the prevalence was significantly higher in patients with HbSS genotype compared with other sickle genotypes with the highest prevalence (15%) observed in women in the age group 30 to 39 years. Fifty-one HbSS patients had a moyamoya vasculopathy, but only 3 of these had concomitant intracranial aneurysms.\nIntracranial aneurysms are common in HbSS SCD. There was also a trend toward more common occurrence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in HbSS; women in the age group 30 to 39 years were most at risk. There was no correlation between the occurrence of intracranial aneurysms and moyamoya syndrome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005cfc","authors":["Peter Birkeland","Kate Gardner","Rachel Kesse-Adu","John Davies","Jens Lauritsen","Frantz Rom Poulsen","Christos M.
