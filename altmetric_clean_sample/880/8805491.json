Here we show that such challenges can be overcome by a magnetophoretic approach to accelerate NP delivery to tumors. Payload-bearing poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) NPs were converted into polymer-iron-oxide nanocomposites (PINCs) by attaching colloidal Fe3O4 onto the surface, via a simple surface modification method using dopamine polymerization. PINCs formed stable dispersions in serum-supplemented medium and responded quickly to magnetic field gradients above 1\u00a0kG\/cm. Under the field gradients, PINCs were rapidly transported across physical barriers and into cells and captured under flow conditions similar to those encountered in postcapillary venules, increasing the local concentration by nearly three orders of magnitude. In\u00a0vivo magnetophoretic delivery enabled PINCs to accumulate in poorly vascularized subcutaneous SKOV3 xenografts that did not support the EPR effect. In\u00a0vivo magnetic resonance imaging, ex\u00a0vivo fluorescence imaging, and tissue histology all confirmed that the uptake of PINCs was higher in tumors exposed to magnetic field gradients, relative to negative controls.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e8","authors":["Jinho Park","Naveen Reddy Kadasala","Sara A.
