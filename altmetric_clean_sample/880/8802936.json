Fourteen male C57BL\/6 mice were implanted with electrodes for sleep recording. Continuous spectral analysis was performed on the electroencephalogram (EEG) to obtain theta power (6-9Hz) and delta power (0-4Hz), as well as the R-R interval signals in order to quantify the high-frequency power (HF) and normalized low-frequency power (LF%) that are used to assess parasympathetic and sympathetic activity, respectively. All animals underwent a sleep deprivation experiment and a control experiment (6-h intervention and 1-h recovery period) on two separate days. During sleep deprivation, HF and theta power during wakefulness were significantly higher than during the control wakefulness after the second hour and first hour, respectively. During recovery non-rapid eye movement sleep, there was a rebound in sleep time and delta power as well as an elevation in HF relative to control post-intervention sleep. Both the rise in HF and theta power during extended wakefulness were found to be positively correlated with the delta power rebound. Furthermore, the HF change during extended wakefulness was also correlated with the amount of sleep loss and the enhancement of waking theta power. Our finding suggests that waking parasympathetic activity intimately reflects the cumulative sleep pressure, suggesting a potential role to be an autonomic marker for sleep propensity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031aa","authors":["Kuo, T B J","Lai, C T","Chen, C Y","Yang, Y C","Yang, C C H"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuroscience.2016.05.060","first_seen_on":"2016-06-16T20:49:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-7544","03064522"],"journal":"Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1466110133,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0306452216302196&_version=1&md5=6c9a16414fbdc82898e154963aa8ba47"],"pmid":"27267244","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"The high-frequency component of heart rate variability during extended wakefulness is closely associated with the depth of the ensuing sleep in C57BL6 mice","type":"article","volume":"330","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highfrequency-component-heart-rate-variability-during-extended-wakefulness-closely-associated-depth"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7907411,"mean":6.6922707093667,"rank":6846689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7907411,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245273,"mean":11.863241943638,"rank":205558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245273,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3294,"mean":3.8726267840875,"rank":2765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3294,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":4.3004935064935,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/743545907115761664","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8802936],"posted_on":"2016-06-16T20:48:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":964},"tweet_id":"743545907115761664"}]}}
