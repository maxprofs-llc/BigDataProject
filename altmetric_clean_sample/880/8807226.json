The aim of this study was to compare folate intake and folate status during pregnancy of women with high long-term vegetable intake and those eating an average Western diet. In a prospective study that included 109 participants, pregnant women adhering to a predominant vegetarian diet with high vegetable intake for 8 +\/- 0.5 y with subgroups of ovo-lacto vegetarians (n = 27) and low meat eaters (n = 43) and women eating an average Western diet (control group, n = 39) were compared with regard to dietary intake and plasma and red blood cell (RBC) folate concentrations during wk 9-12, 20-22 and 36-38 of gestation. Plasma and RBC folate concentrations were highest in ovo-lacto vegetarians, followed by low meat eaters and lowest in the controls. Ovo-lacto vegetarians and low meat eaters showed a lower risk for folate deficiency, with RBC folate concentrations of <320 nmol\/L resulting in odds ratios of 0.10 (95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.56) and 0.52 (95% confidence interval, 0.20-1.34), respectively. In ovo-lacto vegetarians, the RBC folate concentration was positively related to the intake of vitamin B-12 (r = 0.51, P: < 0.0001). The results of the study suggest that long-term high vegetable intake favorably affects plasma folate as well as RBC folate concentrations throughout pregnancy and reduces the risk of folate deficiency if an adequate vitamin B-12 supply is ensured.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8d","authors":["Koebnick, C","Heins, U A","Hoffmann, I","Dagnelie, P C","Leitzmann, C"],"first_seen_on":"2016-06-17T00:49:35+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0022-3166"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1445341140,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11238752"],"pmid":"11238752","pubdate":"2001-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Folate status during pregnancy in women is improved by long-term high vegetable intake compared with the average western diet.","type":"article","volume":"131","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/folate-status-during-pregnancy-women-improved-longterm-high-vegetable-intake-compared-average-wester"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6348733,"mean":5.9808086398984,"rank":649958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":5665341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6348733,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":212281,"mean":12.227738797814,"rank":34757,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":177265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":212281,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3415,"mean":10.942142940832,"rank":794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":2560,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3415,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":31.400972222222,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
