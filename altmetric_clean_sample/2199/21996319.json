To further confirm the causal relationship between the ABCA2 gene (HaABCA2) and Cry2Ab resistance in H. armigera, two HaABCA2 knockout strains were created from the susceptible SCD strain with the CRISPR\/Cas9 genome editing system. One strain (SCD-A2KO1) is homozygous for a 2-bp deletion in exon 2 of HaABCA2 created by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The other strain (SCD-A2KO2) is homozygous for a 5-bp deletion in exon 18 of HaABCA2 made by homology-directed repair (HDR), which was produced to mimic the r2 resistance allele of a field-derived Cry2Ab-resistant strain from Australia. Both knockout strains obtained high levels of resistance to both Cry2Aa (>120-fold) and Cry2Ab (>100-fold) compared with the original SCD strain, but no or very limited resistance to Cry1Ac (<4-fold). Resistance to Cry2Ab in both knockouts is recessive, and genetic complementary tests confirmed Cry2Ab resistance alleles are at the same locus (i.e. HaABCA2) for the two strains. Brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) of midguts from both knockout strains lost binding with Cry2Ab, but maintained the same binding with Cry1Ac as the SCD strain. In vivo functional evidence from this study demonstrates knockout of HaABCA2 confers high levels of resistance to both Cry2Aa and Cry2Ab, confirming that HaABCA2 plays a key role in mediating toxicity of both Cry2Aa and Cry2Ab against H. armigera.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae8","authors":["Wang, Jing","Wang, Huidong","Liu, Shaoyan","Liu, Laipan","Tay, Wee Tek","Walsh, Thomas K.","Yang, Yihua","Wu, Yidong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ibmb.2017.07.002","first_seen_on":"2017-07-17T08:39:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0965-1748","09651748"],"journal":"Insect Biochemistry & Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1500280761,"links":["http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fpii%2FS0965174817301030"],"pmid":"28705634","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"CRISPR\/Cas9 mediated genome editing of  Helicoverpa armigera  with mutations of an ABC transporter gene  HaABCA2  confers resistance to  Bacillus thuringiensis  Cry2A toxins","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crisprcas9-mediated-genome-editing-helicoverpa-armigera-mutations-abc-transporter-gene-haabca2-confe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223669,"mean":6.9683210333815,"rank":7116943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223669,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159136,"mean":11.827450692808,"rank":130454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159136,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":502,"mean":2.7959560878244,"rank":410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":502,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.37,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
