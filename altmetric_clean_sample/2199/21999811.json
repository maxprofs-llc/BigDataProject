Microemulsions were prepared by mixing selected oil, surfactants and aqueous phase containing bacteriophages. The formulations were subjected to physicochemical characterization, ex-vivo and in-vivo permeation, stability studies, histological and immunofluorescence examination. The colloidal system exhibits a uniform size distribution, of finite size (150-320nm). Transmission electron microscopy revealed the encapsulation of bacteriophage in the aqueous globule. Ex-vivo permeation across skin was successfully achieved as 6\u00d710(6)PFU\/mL and 6.7\u00d710(6)PFU\/mL of T4 permeated from ME 6% and 10%, respectively. ME 6% was found to be thermodynamically stable and in-vivo permeation resulted in 5.49\u00d710(5)PFU\/mL of bacteriophages in the blood of the E. coli challenged rats, while 2.48\u00d710(5)PFU\/mL was detected in germ free rats, at the end of the study. Infected rats that were treated with bacteriophage were survived while significant mortality was observed in others. Histological and IL-6 immunofluorescence examination of the tissues revealed the efficacy\/safety of the therapy. The microemulsion-based transdermal delivery of bacteriophage could be a promising approach to treat the infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000284c","authors":["Rastogi, Vaibhav","Yadav, Pragya","Verma, Anurag","Pandit, Jayanta K."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejps.2017.07.014","first_seen_on":"2017-07-17T10:20:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0928-0987","1879-0720"],"journal":"European Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1500286805,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28711712?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28711712","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["chemistry","pharmacology"],"title":"Ex vivo and in vivo evaluation of microemulsion based transdermal delivery of  E .  coli  specific T4 bacteriophage: A rationale approach to treat bacterial infection","type":"article","volume":"107","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ex-vivo-vivo-evaluation-microemulsion-based-transdermal-delivery-e-coli-specific-t4-bacteriophage-ra"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223669,"mean":6.9683210333815,"rank":7116947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223669,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159177,"mean":11.824515416897,"rank":130460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159177,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":721,"mean":4.9895444444444,"rank":635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":721,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.71875,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/phagepapers\/statuses\/886893257988243456","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21999811],"posted_on":"2017-07-17T10:20:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Phagepapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/554637481182629889\/S0W4QvZw_normal.jpeg","description":"Tweet bot that delivers new phage related papers and news!
