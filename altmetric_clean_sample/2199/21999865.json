Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is proposed as a neurotrophic marker in BD. However, the current evidence for its use in monitoring disease activity and illness progression is conflicting and an exploration of additional neurotrophic markers is needed. This prospective case-control study investigated mood-specific changes in potential neurotrophic markers and their association to inflammatory activity. Patients with BD were included during an acute mood episode, either depressive (n=35) or (hypo)manic (n=32). Fifty-nine patients (88%) and 29 healthy controls (97%) completed the study. Peripheral blood levels of BDNF, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF), soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were measured at baseline and after 2 months. Biomarker levels in patients were compared to controls and correlated to HDRS-17 and YMRS total scores and the PANSS positive subscale scores. Linear mixed model analysis revealed no significant differences in neurotrophic markers between patients and controls. We found significantly increased TNF-\u03b1 levels in patients and a subsequent normalization during euthymia. None of the biomarkers strongly correlated to mood symptom severity. Despite standardized methodological practices, BDNF and VEGF levels had a wide distribution range. We need a better understanding of methodological aspects influencing the analysis of neurotrophic factors to improve future research on markers for mood state monitoring and illness progression in BD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033e6","authors":["van den Ameele, Seline","Coppens, Violette","Schuermans, Jeroen","De Boer, Peter","Timmers, Maarten","Fransen, Erik","Sabbe, Bernard","Morrens, Manuel","Seline van den Ameele","Violette Coppens","Jeroen Schuermans","Peter De Boer","Maarten Timmers","Erik Fransen","Bernard Sabbe","Manuel Morrens"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.psyneuen.2017.07.003","first_seen_on":"2017-07-17T10:22:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0306-4530","1873-3360","03064530"],"journal":"Psychoneuroendocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1500617450,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28711724?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0306453017303736?_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_docanchor=&md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0306453017303736&_version=1&md5=7590985cc72d312c17682a7dfcb2a671"],"pmid":"28711724","pubdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology","psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"Neurotrophic and inflammatory markers in bipolar disorder: A prospective study","type":"article","volume":"84","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neurotrophic-inflammatory-markers-bipolar-disorder-prospective-study-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8384958,"mean":7.0642591011419,"rank":4475243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2333579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8384958,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204397,"mean":13.326667410321,"rank":115021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":69654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204397,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2001,"mean":9.270202,"rank":1208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2001,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":3.0013513513514,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"PT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ThihaSwe_dr\/statuses\/886139100654206976","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21999865],"posted_on":"2017-07-15T08:23:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Psychiatry Updates","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PsychiatryUpdates.by.DrThihaSwe","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3471096253\/6b7bd3fc313986902cd1574474364bae_normal.jpeg","description":"[RSS Updates from Psychiatry Journals globally, plus some mental health related news] \/ Should follow only if you are interested in Mental Health","id_on_source":"ThihaSwe_dr","tweeter_id":"1259166031","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":994},"tweet_id":"886139100654206976"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/braintumor_UL\/statuses\/886893756774989824","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21999865],"posted_on":"2017-07-17T10:22:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Brain tumor ULisboa","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/687579003163643904\/d5iTojK9_normal.jpg","description":"Follow for the latest updates on Brain tumors.
