In none of the 54 eyes was the I.O.P. higher after administration of the drug. On the contrary, the I.O.P. was siginificantly or highly significantly reduced for more than 2 hours, probably because of the beta-receptor-blocking component of the preparation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000585f","authors":["Tony C.y.
