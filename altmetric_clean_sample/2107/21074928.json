Next, the demand function relating drug intake and response cost was determined by increasing the FR across sessions during the availability of each of several unit doses of nicotine (0.0032-0.032\u00a0mg\/kg\/inj). The reinforcing effects of 0.01\u00a0mg\/kg\/inj cocaine and 1\u00a0g banana-flavored food pellets were also determined under similar testing conditions. Finally, the nicotine demand function was re-determined after approximately 8\u00a0months of daily IV nicotine self-administration.\nIV nicotine self-administration followed an inverted U-shaped pattern, with the peak number of injections maintained by 0.0032\u00a0mg\/kg\/inj. Self-administration of each reinforcer (food pellets, IV cocaine, and IV nicotine) decreased as FR size increased. Application of the exponential model of demand showed that demand elasticity for nicotine was (1) dose-dependent and lowest for 0.0032\u00a0mg\/kg\/inj; (2) for 0.0032 mg\/kg\/inj,\u00a0similar to that of food pellets and significantly higher than cocaine; and (3) decreased after 8\u00a0months of daily nicotine self-administration.\nThese data show that, though high levels of nicotine self-administration can be achieved under simple FR schedules in nonhuman primates, its reinforcing effectiveness is dose-related but limited and may increase over time.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033ea","authors":["Stephen J.
