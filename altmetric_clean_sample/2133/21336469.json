Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services initiatives, such as Bundled Payment for Care Improvement Program, have already demonstrated their ability to create financial and performance accountability in the public sector. More recently, these value-based models have been introduced among private payers to increase coordination, quality, and efficiency. Bundled payment strategies provide incentives for physicians and healthcare professionals to eliminate unnecessary services and reduce costs. This article discusses our experience at a private institution with transitioning to a bundled payment program, while identifying the challenges and strategies associated with a successful implementation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6203cf058f610007b79","authors":["Ameer M.
