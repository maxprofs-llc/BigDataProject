We evaluated whether MEDI8852 was effective for prophylaxis and therapy against representative group I (H5N1) and group II (H7N9) pandemic IAV in mice and ferrets and could be used to block transmission of influenza H1N1pdm09 in ferrets, compared to an irrelevant control MAb R347 and oseltamivir.\nMEDI8852 was effective for prophylaxis and treatment of H7N9 and H5N1 infection in mice, with a clear dose-dependent response and treatment with MEDI8852 24, 48 or 72 h post-infection (hpi) was superior to oseltamivir for H5N1. MEDI8852 alone was effective treatment for lethal H5N1 infection in ferrets compared to oseltamivir and R347 and MEDI8852 plus oseltamivir was better than oseltamivir alone. MEDI8852 or oseltamivir alone early in infection were equally effective for H7N9 infection in ferrets while the combination yielded similar protection when treatment was delayed. MEDI8852 was able to protect na\u00efve ferrets from airborne transmission of H1N1pdm09.\nMEDI8852, alone or with oseltamivir, shows promise for prophylaxis or therapy of group I and II IAVs with pandemic potential. Additionally, MEDI8852 blocked influenza transmission in ferrets, a unique finding among influenza specific MAbs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","authors":["Paules, C.
