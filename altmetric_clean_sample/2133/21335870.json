In addition, other important risk factors of nonadherence are neglected or insufficiently addressed. There is good evidence for the significant role of the quality of the patient-healthcare provider relationship. Other risk factors like the individual history of nonadherence, the lack of acceptance of having a treatable disorder, fear of side-effects, comorbid depression, and cognitive impairment have been broadly neglected in adherence programs, although they offer a powerful key to improve adherence-oriented interventions.\nCurrent research on determinants of nonadherence has focused on a few risk factors, while neglecting crucial psychological predictors of nonadherence. The personalized consideration of a multiplicity of risk factors offers a new basis for the development and evaluation of interventions to better promote adherence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000586b","authors":["Arlt, Antje D.","Nestoriuc, Yvonne","Rief, Winfried"],"doi":"10.1097\/yco.0000000000000345","first_seen_on":"2017-06-25T14:14:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0951-7367"],"issue":"5","journal":"Current opinion in psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1501175318,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-psychiatry\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Why_current_drug_adherence_programs_fail__.99349.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-psychiatry\/Abstract\/2017\/09000\/Why_current_drug_adherence_programs_fail__.3.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/co-psychiatry\/9000\/00000\/Why_current_drug_adherence_programs_fail__.99349.pdf","pmid":"28632512","pubdate":"2017-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"326","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Why current drug adherence programs fail","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-psychiatry\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Why_current_drug_adherence_programs_fail__.99349.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/current-drug-adherence-programs-fail-addressing-psychological-risk-factors-nonadherence"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282957,"mean":6.9842712712639,"rank":3917656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4181003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282957,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224925,"mean":11.974803818178,"rank":103576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":114483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224925,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":672,"mean":5.3918777943368,"rank":406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":672,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":3.4166666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/a2zpharmsci\/statuses\/878977000182099968","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21335870],"posted_on":"2017-06-25T14:03:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Ajaz S.
