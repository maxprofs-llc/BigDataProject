Although HCMV immune correlates of protection are only poorly defined, neutralizing antibodies (NAb) targeting the envelope pentamer complex (PC) composed of subunits gH, gL, UL128, UL130, and UL131A are thought to contribute in preventing HCMV infection. Here, we describe a continuous target sequence within UL128 that is recognized by a previously isolated potent PC-specific NAb, termed 13B5. By using peptide based scanning procedures we identified a 13 amino acid long target sequence at the UL128 C-terminus that binds the 13B5 antibody with similar affinity as purified PC. In addition, the 13B5 binding site is universally conserved in HCMV, contains a previously described UL128\/gL interaction site, and interferes with 13B5 neutralizing function, indicating that the 13B5 epitope sequence is located within the PC at a site of critical importance for HCMV neutralization. Vaccination of mice with peptides containing the 13B5 target sequence resulted in robust stimulation of binding antibodies, and in a subset of immunized animals in induction of detectable NAb, supporting that the identified 13B5 target sequence constitutes a PC-specific neutralizing epitope. These findings provide evidence for the discovery of a continuous neutralizing epitope within the UL128 subunit of the PC that could be an important target of humoral immune responses that are involved in the protection against congenital HCMV infection.\nNeutralizing antibodies (NAb) targeting the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) envelope pentamer complex (PC) are thought to be important in preventing HCMV transmission from the mother to the fetus, thereby mitigating severe developmental disabilities in newborns. However, the epitope sequences within the PC that are recognized by these potentially protective antibody responses are only poorly defined. Here, we provide evidence for the existence of a highly conserved, continuous PC-specific epitope sequence that appears to be located within the PC at a subunit interaction site of critical importance for HCMV neutralization. These discoveries provide insights into a continuous PC-specific neutralizing epitope, which could be an important target for a vaccine formulation to interfere with congenital HCMV infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Flavia Chiuppesi","Teodora Kaltcheva","Zhuo Meng","Peter A.
