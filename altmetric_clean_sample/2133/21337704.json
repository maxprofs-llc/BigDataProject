Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequence placed the isolate into the genus Delftia within a cluster encompassing the type strains of Delftia lacustris, Delftia tsuruhatensis, Delftia acidovorans and Delftia litopenaei, which presented greater than 97\u200a% sequence similarity with respect to strain RA6T. DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed average relatedness ranging from of 11 to 18\u200a% between these species of the genus Delftia and strain RA6T. Catalase and oxidase were positive. Casein was hydrolysed but gelatin and starch were not. Ubiquinone 8 was the major respiratory quinone detected in strain RA6T together with low amounts of ubiquinones 7 and 9. The major fatty acids were those from summed feature 3 (C16\u200a:\u200a1\u03c97c\/C16\u200a:\u200a1\u2009\u03c96c) and C16\u200a:\u200a0. The predominant polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. Phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic analyses showed that strain RA6T should be considered as a representative of a novel species of genus Delftia, for which the name Delftia rhizosphaerae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is RA6T (=LMG 29737T= CECT 9171T).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["Lorena Carro","Rebeca Mulas","Raquel Pastor-Bueis","Daniel Blanco","Arsenio Terr\u00f3n","Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez-Andr\u00e9s","Alvaro Peix","Encarna Vel\u00e1zquez"],"doi":"10.1099\/ijsem.0.001892","first_seen_on":"2017-06-25T17:16:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1466-5026","1466-5034"],"journal":"International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1498399200,"links":["http:\/\/ijs.microbiologyresearch.org\/content\/journal\/ijsem\/10.1099\/ijsem.0.001892"],"pmid":"28629496","pubdate":"2017-06-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Microbiology Society","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Delftia rhizosphaerae sp. nov. isolated from the rhizosphere of Cistus ladanifer","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":5.08,"6m":5.08,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":1630964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6770236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237253,"mean":12.924284549761,"rank":60722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":175649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237253,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3922,"mean":2.7536674317776,"rank":197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":3719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3922,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":2.1087755102041,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"June 25, 2017","url":"https:\/\/microbiomedigest.com\/2017\/06\/25\/june-25-2017\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[21319244,21337700,21275015,21328059,18481934,21029466,21242491,21337704,21158073,21320328,21321532,21337706,21320362,17347233,21307689,21299786,21200731],"posted_on":"2017-06-25T14:00:00+00:00","summary":"Lots of interesting pre-prints in this post that might be worth following!
