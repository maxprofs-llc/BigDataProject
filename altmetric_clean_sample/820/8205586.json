Yet, the exact crystallographic structure on which their band structure depends remains highly debated. In this scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory study, we have analysed graphene samples grown on multilayer graphene prepared onto SiC and on the close-packed surfaces of Re and Ir with ultra-high precision. We resolve small-angle twists and shears in graphene, and identify large unit cells comprising more than 1,000 carbon atoms and exhibiting non-trivial nanopatterns for moir\u00e9 superlattices, which are commensurate to the graphene lattice. Finally, a general formalism applicable to any hexagonal moir\u00e9 is presented to classify all reported structures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","arxiv_id":"1605.07356","authors":["Alexandre Artaud","Laurence Magaud","Toai Le Quang","Val\u00e9rie Guisset","Philippe David","Claude Chapelier","Johann Coraux"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep25670","first_seen_on":"2016-05-25T10:32:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1464140899,"links":["http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1605.07356"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1605.07356v1","pmid":"27181495","pubdate":"2016-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"25670","subjects":["science"],"title":"Universal classification of twisted, strained and sheared graphene moir\u00e9 superlattices","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/universal-classification-twisted-strained-sheared-graphene-moir%C3%A9-superlattices"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7757128,"mean":6.6329627680391,"rank":5869522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1045225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7757128,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268889,"mean":11.433158861682,"rank":187752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268889,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30641,"mean":14.950997780679,"rank":22615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":4513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30641,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3133,"mean":15.015364623244,"rank":2254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3133,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
