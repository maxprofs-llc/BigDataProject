Long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) belong to a new class of ncRNAs including tens of thousands different species. A fraction of these molecules shows a striking cancer-enriched expression pattern, suggesting an essential role in tumor cells and, possibly, a utility in therapeutic terms. This review aims at summarizing current knowledge for the identification and validation of lncRNAs as therapeutics targets in tumors. Both in-silico and wet-biology resources are presented in relation to the many challenges that the scientific community still needs to address in terms of lncRNA identification, stratification, patient personalization, drug delivery and toxicity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032df","authors":["Lavorgna, Giovanni","Vago, Riccardo","Sarmini, Mohamad","Montorsi, Francesco","Salonia, Andrea","Bellone, Matteo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.phrs.2016.05.018","first_seen_on":"2016-05-25T10:20:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-1186","10436618"],"journal":"Pharmacological Research","last_mentioned_on":1464134587,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1043661816304303"],"pmid":"27210721","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Long non-coding RNAs as novel therapeutic targets in cancer","type":"article","volume":"110","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/long-noncoding-rnas-novel-therapeutic-targets-cancer-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7757128,"mean":6.6329627680391,"rank":5869523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1045220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7757128,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268889,"mean":11.433165555919,"rank":187750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268889,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":736,"mean":5.193831292517,"rank":477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":736,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":6.3276071428571,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
