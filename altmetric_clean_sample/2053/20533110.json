REG3A is considered an oncogene in various cancers, but in GC its role is unclear. Here, we report that the expression of REG3A was significantly increased in the tumor tissues of patients with GC compared with the matched normal tissues. Knockdown of REG3A induced by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly repressed the proliferation of GC cells for 24 h or 48 h. Moreover, knockdown of REG3A significantly suppressed the migration, invasion, and adhesion of GC cells in vitro. Furthermore, knockdown of REG3A reduced the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3, and altered the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression levels of E-cadherin, Snail, RhoC, MTA1, MMP-2, and MMP-9. Taken together, REG3A is overexpressed in GC and promotes the proliferation, migration, invasion, and adhesion of GC cells by regulating the JAK2\/STAT3 signal pathway. REG3A may be a potential therapeutic target for GC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bca2","authors":["Zhou-Feng Chen","Zhi-Ming Huang","Hai-Bo Xue","Xiu-Qing Lin","Ren-Ping Chen","Meng-Jun Chen","Rui-Fang Jin"],"doi":"10.2147\/ott.s131443","first_seen_on":"2017-05-26T08:38:21+00:00","issns":["1178-6930"],"journal":"OncoTargets and therapy","last_mentioned_on":1495751710,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/reg3a-promotes-the-proliferation-migration-and-invasion-of-gastric-can-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-OTT"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=35869","pmcid":"PMC5388263","pmid":"28435292","pubdate":"2017-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"title":"REG3A promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reg3a-promotes-proliferation-migration-invasion-gastric-cancer-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":4155915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3899174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238029,"mean":12.092199472331,"rank":119236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":108684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238029,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1024,"mean":2.1932394916911,"rank":250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1024,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":11.9795,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/GastricCancerFD\/statuses\/867871694886711296","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20533110],"posted_on":"2017-05-25T22:35:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Gastric Cancer Foun.","url":"http:\/\/www.gastriccancer.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/775736984178339840\/b4WAFLc3_normal.jpg","description":"The Gastric Cancer Foundation (GCF) is dedicated to improving the lives of people affected by stomach cancer and to working with researchers to find a cure","id_on_source":"GastricCancerFD","tweeter_id":"2524863247","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":297},"tweet_id":"867871694886711296"}],"facebook":[{"title":"REG3A promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric c | OTT","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=10154568170716547&id=104859701546","license":"public","citation_ids":[20533110],"posted_on":"2017-05-25T22:14:00+00:00","summary":"An article in Dove Medical Press finds the protein REG3A promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer.","author":{"name":"Gastric Cancer Foundation","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/104859701546","facebook_wall_name":"Gastric Cancer Foundation","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/104859701546\/picture","id_on_source":"104859701546"}}]}}
