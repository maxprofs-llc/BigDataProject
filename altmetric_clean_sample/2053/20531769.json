Based on a national telephone survey, this paper assesses the future direction of PPOs by examining segments of the market that are believed to be lead indicators of future activity. It includes analyses of \"new\" versus \"old\" PPOs, the ten largest PPOs, and the entrance of hospital chains into the insurance market. We conclude that the dramatic growth of PPO enrollment in 1985 is likely to continue in the future, but with increased movement toward vertical integration and joint ventures among providers and insurers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f61000188d","authors":["Jon Gabel","Dan Ermann","Thomas Rice","Gregory de Lissovoy"],"doi":"10.1215\/03616878-11-2-305","first_seen_on":"2017-05-26T08:25:00+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0361-6878","1527-1927"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law","last_mentioned_on":1438387200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1215\/03616878-11-2-305"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jhppl.dukejournals.org\/content\/11\/2\/305.full.pdf","pmid":"3745843","pubdate":"1986-06-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Duke University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Policy And Administration","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Law","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","publichealth","jurisprudence"],"title":"The Emergence and Future of PPOs","type":"article","volume":"11"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7770131,"mean":6.6353305651196,"rank":1899985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4823597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7770131,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99084,"mean":11.090643944976,"rank":29107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":69098,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99084,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":701,"mean":7.9460085714286,"rank":263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":701,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":116.91,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Health Care Spending: Historical Trends and New Directions","url":"http:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w21501.pdf","license":"public","citation_ids":[20531736,219196,1954416,638659,578654,20531744,173642,2701546,2464631,15697354,14512550,14596868,8415425,15060306,8429607,16179504,3556030,16194414,14508867,2783095,1803970,173545,2578270,14510358,16179506,8486484,20531750,20531752,20531755,16194257,14501081,8429602,1616021,8437828,1098348,14584520,14505245,1489435,1438023,3329773,3580870,2602164,20531763,8416953,20531769,794177,914251,14512609,15597037,16249802,8429604,2569884,2448498,2873958,1450797,8448472,16178324,1301175,14512612,20531775,173857,16685406,1542073,8445993,985116,22828350,14508932,14508483,2698668,14506775,20531776,15017238,8296006,15017235,8830033,12393248,14773065,1348477],"posted_on":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","source":{"name":"National Bureau of Economic Research","description":"The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is a private, non-profit, non-partisan organisation dedicated to conducting economic research and to disseminating research findings among academics, public policy makers, and business professionals.","geo":{"country":"US"}},"page_url":"http:\/\/nber.org\/papers\/w21501","collections":[],"author":{"image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/cache.altmetric.com\/policy\/thumbnails\/thumbnail-56fd3743453ada7d57197e4b1250a05551ec8664b4b8ef33f0eb739255f11b08.jpg"}}]}}
