It is about the use of video games as a therapeutic tool, mobilizing of the symptomatology of the teenager.\n\"Pixels\" workshops use playing according to three specific forms: the paper role-play game, the video game, and the cards playing game. Their specificity is that the participative adult shows a regressive ability strong enough to play with teenagers and is very careful to not interpret what takes place within.\n\"Passerelle\" workshops demonstrate the link between the teenager's mind and the use of his own virtual avatar. It allows to evolve from a \"play together\" to a \"talk together\", a moment of symbolization and of being able to stand back in regards to his or her own recreational activities. As a discussion, this clinical illustration of Karl recovering from depression and dependency. This setting for speech allowed him to evolve into an impulse mood and to reconnect emotionally.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa70b3cf058f61000a6ad","authors":["Descamps, Guillaume","d'Alcantara, Ann"],"first_seen_on":"2016-09-25T15:53:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0353-5053"],"issue":"Suppl-1","journal":"Psychiatria Danubina","last_mentioned_on":1474848622,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27663806?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27663806?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27663806","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Gaming as a Therapeutic Tool in Adolescence.
