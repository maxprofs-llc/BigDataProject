The dampness-heat syndrome in chronic hepatitis B and nonalcoholic fatty liver is regarded as the breakthrough point. We discussed the molecular mechanism of similar connotation that exists in chronic hepatitis B and nonalcoholic fatty liver by metabonomics to give the modern understanding of dampness-heat syndrome. Both urine and serum metabolic profiling revealed that obvious differences existed between dampness-heat syndrome and non-dampness-heat syndrome but the commonality was proved to appear in chronic hepatitis B and nonalcoholic fatty liver patients with dampness-heat syndrome. Furthermore, disorder of body fluid metabolism, decline in digestive capacity, and imbalance of intestinal flora were found to be the new guiding for treatment, with the hope to provide the basis for Chinese personalized medicine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c64","authors":["Dai, Jianye"],"doi":"10.1155\/2013\/793820","first_seen_on":"2013-04-08T19:48:59+00:00","issns":["1741-427X"],"journal":"Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)","last_mentioned_on":1365437758,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2013\/793820\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2013\/793820.pdf","pmid":"23690853","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Similar Connotation in Chronic Hepatitis B and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Patients with Dampness-Heat Syndrome","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/similar-connotation-chronic-hepatitis-b-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-patients-dampnessheat-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3551177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89321,"mean":6.7843045678461,"rank":70561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89321,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2941,"mean":3.3496891156463,"rank":2311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2941,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":7.7824347826087,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MBHolistic\/statuses\/321295364667875328","license":"public","citation_ids":[1353015],"posted_on":"2013-04-08T16:15:58+00:00","author":{"name":"Monterey Holistic","url":"http:\/\/www.montereybayholistic.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/793206537254686724\/_c1aiyQP_normal.jpg","description":"501(c)3 #health #education #exercise #healthnews #nutrition #holistic #fitness #wellness #inspirational #healing #success #quotes #yoga #chiropractic #fitness","id_on_source":"MBHolistic","tweeter_id":"28173797","geo":{"lt":37.25022,"ln":-119.75126,"country":"US"},"followers":28295},"tweet_id":"321295364667875328"}]}}
