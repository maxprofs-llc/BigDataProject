Exposure to drugs is considered to be the most common cause of acute hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. Experience with regional anesthesia, in particular peripheral nerve blocks, is rarely described in patients with G6PD deficiency, but is of great clinical interest. For this reason, we now report on the successful management of ultrasound-guided axillary brachial plexus block in a patient with geriatric G6PD deficiency.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f61000755a","doi":"10.1177\/2151458512472903","first_seen_on":"2013-04-11T07:31:22+00:00","issns":["2151-4585"],"issue":"4","journal":"Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1365588247,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23569708?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23569708","pubdate":"2012-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia in a Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD)-Deficient Geriatric Trauma Patient.","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultrasoundguided-regional-anesthesia-glucose6phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pddeficient-geriatric-trauma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626860,"mean":4.9517239589446,"rank":2907224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626860,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85503,"mean":6.544969451007,"rank":66232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85503,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.2862962962963,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/321926560871510016","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1359477],"posted_on":"2013-04-10T10:04:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
