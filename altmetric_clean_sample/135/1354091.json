Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this heightened sensitivity commonly termed opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). Most of these proposed mechanisms involve plastic events in the central or peripheral nervous systems. Alterations in the abundance of peripheral mediators of nociception have not previously been explored.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000875","doi":"10.1186\/1744-8069-4-7","first_seen_on":"2013-04-09T01:52:57+00:00","issns":["1744-8069"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Pain","last_mentioned_on":1215702638,"links":["http:\/\/www.molecularpain.com\/content\/4\/1\/7"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.molecularpain.com\/content\/pdf\/1744-8069-4-7.pdf","pmid":"18294378","pubdate":"2008-02-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pain Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"7","subjects":["molecularbiology","psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Chronic morphine administration enhances nociceptive sensitivity and local cytokine production after incision","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chronic-morphine-administration-enhances-nociceptive-sensitivity-local-ytokine-production-after-inci"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.52,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.52},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627649,"mean":4.9475528391989,"rank":539794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3087736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627649,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85499,"mean":6.5490823177151,"rank":14903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":70593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85499,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232,"mean":2.7685887445887,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.49,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
