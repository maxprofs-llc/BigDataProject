Personality was assessed using the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire. We evaluated whether similarity increased with increasing length of marriage. Evidence of spousal convergence was inconsistent across analyses, arguing against this mechanism as a compelling explanation for spousal similarity. Accordingly, selection processes may better explain spousal similarity in these data. The one exception might be for aggressive aspects of personality.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032ca","authors":["Humbad MN","Donnellan MB","Iacono WG","McGue M","Burt SA","Mikhila N.
