Due to the realities in China, traditional medical education is facing many challenges. There are few opportunities for students to practice their clinical skills and their dexterities are generally at a low level. Medical simulation-based education is a new teaching modality and helps to improve medicos' clinical skills to a large degree. Medical simulation-based education has many significant advantages and will be further developed and applied.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007b9b","authors":["Wang Z","Liu Q","Wang H"],"doi":"10.7555\/jbr.27.20120131","first_seen_on":"2013-04-08T10:39:02+00:00","issns":["1674-8301"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Biomedical Research","last_mentioned_on":1402416133,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23554799","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3602866\/?utm_content=bufferb24c2&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"23554799","pubdate":"2013-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Medical simulation-based education improves medicos' clinical skills.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/medical-simulationbased-education-improves-medicos-clinical-skills"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":1990006,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419921,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89320,"mean":6.7842825602616,"rank":36322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":50483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89320,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.49025,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.9583333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
