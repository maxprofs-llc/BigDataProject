However, the steady increase in global capacity to produce annual seasonal influenza vaccine has not been matched with increased demand, and thus actual vaccine production. Currently, without a significant increase in demand for seasonal influenza vaccine, global capacity will be far from able to meet even the essential needs for a monovalent vaccine in the event of a severe influenza pandemic. Global commitment to the development of influenza vaccine production capacity was renewed at a consultation leading to the Second Global Action Plan on Influenza Vaccines (GAP) in July 2011. To monitor progress on the GAP, the World Health Organization has carried out periodic surveys of influenza vaccine manufacturers. This latest survey compares current maximum global capacity and actual production of seasonal influenza vaccine in 2011 with data from surveys carried out in 2009 and 2010; analyses global influenza production capacity in the context of sustainability; and discusses options to increase demand, based on strong evidence of public health benefit.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ea","authors":["Partridge J","Kieny MP","Jeffrey Partridge","Marie Paule Kieny"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vaccine.2012.10.111","first_seen_on":"2013-04-11T04:58:58+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0264-410X","0264410X"],"journal":"Vaccine","last_mentioned_on":1440543448,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0264410X12015861","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.vaccine.2012.10.111"],"pmid":"23149268","pubdate":"2012-11-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Global production capacity of seasonal influenza vaccine in 2011 ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/global-production-capacity-seasonal-influenza-vaccine-2011-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8094378,"mean":6.8925303985645,"rank":1009615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7082661,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8094378,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119295,"mean":6.8214602410852,"rank":15988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":103278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119295,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5198,"mean":7.6435832210891,"rank":666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":4575,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5198,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":6.8358909090909,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":89,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
