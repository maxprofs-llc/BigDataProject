In principle, this development offers the possibility to complement the quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR)-dominated repertoire of in silico ADMET methods with protein-structure-based approaches. However, the complex nature and the weak nonspecific ligand-binding properties of ADMET proteins take structural biology methods and current docking programs to the limit. In this review we discuss the utility of protein-structure-based design and docking approaches aimed at overcoming issues related to plasma protein binding, active transport via P-glycoprotein, hERG channel mediated cardiotoxicity and cytochrome P450 inhibition, metabolism and induction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002734","authors":["Stoll F","G\u00f6ller AH","Hillisch A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.drudis.2011.04.008","first_seen_on":"2013-04-09T04:15:49+00:00","issns":["1359-6446"],"issue":"11-12","journal":"Drug Discovery Today","last_mentioned_on":1304361496,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.drudis.2011.04.008"],"pmid":"21554979","pubdate":"2011-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Utility of protein structures in overcoming ADMET-related issues of drug-like compounds.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/utility-protein-structures-overcoming-admetrelated-issues-druglike-compounds"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.992,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.992},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685988,"mean":4.9540738657005,"rank":408049,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":3277711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685988,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85796,"mean":6.5227085261378,"rank":11497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":74296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85796,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":543,"mean":4.4220405904059,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":543,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.15375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":34,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
