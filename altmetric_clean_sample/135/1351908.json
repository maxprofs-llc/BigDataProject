The administration of dietary nucleotides has been demonstrated useful to maintain the immune function in situations of stress and thus could be an appropriate strategy to counteract the decline of the immune function associated to strenuous exercise. The aim of the present study was to asses the impact of a specific nucleotide formulation (Inmunactive\u00ae) on the markers of immune function of athletes after a heavy exercise bout under cold conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000868","authors":["Joan Riera","Victoria Pons","Daniel Martinez-Puig","Carlos Chetrit","Josep A Tur","Antoni Pons","Franchek Drobnic"],"doi":"10.1186\/1550-2783-10-20","first_seen_on":"2013-04-08T11:53:34+00:00","issns":["1550-2783",""],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1477789843,"links":["http:\/\/www.jissn.com\/content\/10\/1\/20\/abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3626726"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jissn.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/1550-2783-10-20?site=jissn.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"23566489","pubdate":"2013-04-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Nursing","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"20","title":"Dietary nucleotide improves markers of immune response to strenuous exercise under a cold environment","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dietary-nucleotide-improves-markers-immune-response-strenuous-exercise-under-cold-environment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7621460,"mean":6.5607387299425,"rank":550026,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7070783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7621460,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116760,"mean":6.6201436977022,"rank":9529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":107225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116760,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":515,"mean":36.011529182879,"rank":224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":515,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":68.909176470588,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":8,"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
