It is well known that deliberating concentrating and inhaling vapours may result in dizziness, euphoria, blackouts, respiratory distress, cardiac and renal failure. However, in the most part, warnings and guidance on use are sparse. Here, a proven case of acute respiratory distress is presented and a reporting mechanism via the UK National Poisons Information Service (NPIS) directly from the Emergency Department (ED) is highlighted. In this case, as a result of our reporting, the aerosol was redesigned and redeployed as a trigger spray with better consumer guidance. Clinicians are reminded of the central role of the ED in the reporting of such hazards.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc98","authors":["Dipak Mistry","Carolyn Meredith"],"doi":"10.1136\/bcr.10.2008.1042","first_seen_on":"2013-04-11T03:35:03+00:00","issns":["1757-790X"],"journal":"BMJ Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1272381225,"links":["http:\/\/casereports.bmj.com\/content\/2009\/bcr.10.2008.1042.full?sid=94f45184-96fc-47c7-93db-a0f34289bc7c"],"pmid":"21686486","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Acute respiratory distress following the inhalation of an aerosol upholstery cleaner: the importance of reporting from the Emergency Department","type":"article","volume":"2009","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acute-respiratory-distress-following-inhalation-aerosol-upholstery-cleaner-importance-reporting-emer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685110,"mean":4.9372923047901,"rank":614166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3055281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685110,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85808,"mean":6.488117006771,"rank":16179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":69318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85808,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1700,"mean":2.7269252501471,"rank":155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":1430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1700,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":4.2439368421053,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":1,"Environmental Science":2}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Acute respiratory distress following the inhalation of an aerosol upholstery cleaner: the importance of reporting from the Emergency Department","url":"http:\/\/blogs.bmj.com\/case-reports\/2010\/04\/27\/acute-respiratory-distress-following-the-inhalation-of-an-aerosol-upholstery-cleaner-the-importance-of-reporting-from-the-emergency-department\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[1357121],"posted_on":"2010-04-27T15:13:45+00:00","summary":"We are exposed to many potential chemical hazards especially at work and this case report highlights the importance of clear labelling on products.
