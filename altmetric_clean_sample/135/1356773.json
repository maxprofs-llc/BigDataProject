This study was carried out with the aim to evaluate the inhibitory activities of different concentrations of the M. malabathricum Linn. flower and fruit crude extracts against Listeria monocytogenes IMR L55, Staphylococcus aureus IMR S244, Escherichia coli IMR E30, and Salmonella typhimurium IMR S100 using the disc diffusion method. The lowest concentrations of the extracts producing inhibition zones against the test microorganisms were used to determine their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). In addition, the growth of Listeria monocytogenes IMR L55 and Staphylococcus aureus IMR S244 grown in medium supplemented with the respective extracts at different temperatures (4\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, and 37\u00b0C) and pHs (4, 6, 7, and 8) was determined.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c64","authors":["Che Omar, Siti Nurhadis"],"doi":"10.1155\/2013\/459089","first_seen_on":"2013-04-11T02:57:14+00:00","issns":["1741-427X"],"journal":"Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)","last_mentioned_on":1365623507,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2013\/459089\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2013\/459089.pdf","pmid":"23662136","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Effects of Flower and Fruit Extracts of <i>Melastoma malabathricum<\/i> Linn. on Growth of Pathogenic Bacteria: <i>Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli,<\/i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium<\/i>","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-flower-fruit-extracts-melastoma-malabathricum-linn-growth-pathogenic-bacteria-listeria-monoc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3077200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":955978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89422,"mean":6.7778524507667,"rank":60352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":18786,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89422,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2941,"mean":3.3496891156463,"rank":1655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2941,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":7.335,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
