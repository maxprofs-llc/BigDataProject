Recent models implicate some of the earliest A\u03b2 oligomers, such as trimers and tetramers, in disease. However, the roles of these structures remain uncertain, in part, because selective probes of their formation are not available. Toward that goal, we generated bivalent versions of the known A\u03b2 ligand, the pentapeptide KLVFF. We found that compounds containing sufficiently long linkers (\u223c19 to 24 \u00c5) recognized primarily A\u03b2 trimers and tetramers, with little binding to either monomer or higher order structures. These compounds might be useful probes for early A\u03b2 oligomers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Ashley A.
