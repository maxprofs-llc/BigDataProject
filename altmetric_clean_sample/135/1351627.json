On their return from deployment, 40 National Guard soldiers were assessed for self-stigma, current distress, attitudes toward mental health care, and psychiatric diagnoses. Eight and a half months later, mental health service utilization was evaluated. Cynicism assessed prior to deployment was associated with lower odds of utilizing mental health services independent of self-stigma and negative attitudes toward mental health care. Further, neither self-stigma nor attitudes toward mental health care predicted engaging in needed mental health care when cynicism was included in the model.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d7","authors":["Arbisi PA","Rusch L","Polusny MA","Thuras P","Erbes CR"],"doi":"10.1037\/a0032225","first_seen_on":"2013-04-08T09:21:18+00:00","issns":["1040-3590"],"issue":"","journal":"Psychological Assessment","last_mentioned_on":1365516664,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23544401"],"pmid":"23544401","pubdate":"2013-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Business And Management","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Does Cynicism Play a Role in Failure to Obtain Needed Care?
