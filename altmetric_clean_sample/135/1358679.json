Countless millions of people worldwide can not help eating selectively massive quantities of unhealthy foods, until they become sick, often mortality. The omega-6 fatty acids account for the majority of PUFA (Poly Unsaturated Fatty Acids) in the food supply. They are the pre-dominant PUFA in all diets, especially the western diets, which produce pro-inflammatory metabolic products. The persistent antigenic or cytotoxic effects will lead to chronic inflammation. Olive tree is native to the Mediterranean basin and parts of Asia Minor. Its compression-extracted oil from the fruit has a wide range of therapeutic and culinary applications. It had been used as aphrodisiacs, emollients, laxatives, nutritives, sedatives, and tonics. In the later part of the 20th century, several studies had revealed that the olives in the Mediteranian diet is linked to a reduced incidence of degenerative diseases. It is one of phytomedicine which has omega-3 fatty acid as its constituent, may inhibit inflammation composing chronic inflammatory process in many chronic diseases, such as coronary artery disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and even cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd4d","authors":["Wardhana","Surachmanto ES","Datau EA"],"first_seen_on":"2013-04-11T06:59:51+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Acta medica Indonesiana","last_mentioned_on":1391171011,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21785178"],"pmid":"21785178","pubdate":"2011-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The role of omega-3 fatty acids contained in olive oil on chronic inflammation.","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-omega3-fatty-acids-contained-olive-oil-chronic-inflammation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230503,"mean":5.96748679288,"rank":2737816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3327388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230503,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98556,"mean":7.010151123738,"rank":44985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":50325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98556,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":2.631875,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.91666666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
