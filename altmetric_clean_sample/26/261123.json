This study evaluates students' responses to geriatrics integration within the curriculum using journals kept by volunteer preclerkship and clerkship students between 2007 and 2010. The journals were used to assess the quality of curricular integration of geriatrics didactic and clinical content, to gather information for shaping the evolving curriculum, and to elicit students' responses about their professional development and caring for older adults.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000296d","doi":"10.1093\/geront\/gnr079","first_seen_on":"2011-09-14T14:11:28+00:00","issns":["1758-5341"],"journal":"Gerontologist","last_mentioned_on":1316007201,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21911847?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21911847","pubdate":"2011-09-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Integrating Geriatrics into Medical School: Student Journaling as an Innovative Strategy for Evaluating Curriculum.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/integrating-geriatrics-medical-school-student-journaling-innovative-strategy-evaluating-curriculum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":982551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63822,"mean":4.693505554598,"rank":40204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":14664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63822,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":561,"mean":4.5216464285714,"rank":446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":561,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":3.97,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
