The aims of this study were to: 1) describe PA levels of girls enrolled in dance classes, 2) determine the contribution of dance classes to total moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and 3) compare PA between days with a dance class (program days) and days without a dance class (non-program days).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000839","authors":["Jennifer R O'Neill","Russell R Pate","Steven P Hooker"],"doi":"10.1186\/1479-5868-8-87","first_seen_on":"2011-09-13T16:09:09+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity","last_mentioned_on":1317146432,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3162521\/?tool=pmcentrez"],"pmid":"21816074","pubdate":"2011-09-13T20:11:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"87","subjects":["behavioralsciences","sportsmedicine","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"The contribution of dance to daily physical activity among adolescent girls","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contribution-dance-daily-physical-activity-among-adolescent-girls"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":2979471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1396077,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":30},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63860,"mean":4.6527264441973,"rank":36948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":24922,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63860,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":739,"mean":10.148246612466,"rank":656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":739,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":5.7429285714286,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
