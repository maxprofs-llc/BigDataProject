We show that the observed spread in this distribution is caused by viscous-drag-induced velocity fluctuations that are correlated with the initial conformation of nanopore-captured molecules. This contribution exceeds that due to diffusional Brownian motion during the passage. Nevertheless, and somewhat counterintuitively, the diffusional Brownian motion determines the fundamental limitations of rapid DNA strand sequencing with a nanopore. We model both diffusional and conformational fluctuations in a Langevin description. It accounts well for passage time variations for DNA molecules of different lengths, and predicts conditions required for low-error-rate nanopore-strand DNA sequencing with nanopores.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011BpJ...101...70L","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c89","authors":["Bo Lu","Fernando Albertorio","David\u00a0P.
