We observed an improvement in psoriasis severity in a patient within days of starting treatment with an incretin-mimetic, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. This was independent of change in glycaemic control. We proposed that this unexpected clinical outcome resulted from a direct effect of GLP-1 on iNKT cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007106","authors":["Hogan AE","Tobin AM","Ahern T","Corrigan MA","Gaoatswe G","Jackson R","O'Reilly V","Lynch L","Doherty DG","Moynagh PN","Kirby B","O'Connell J","O'Shea D","A.
