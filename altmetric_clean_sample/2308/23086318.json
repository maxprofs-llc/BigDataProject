However, little is known about how this interaction controls phenology, life history, and population fitness across multiple generations in natural seasonal environments. To examine how seed dormancy and flowering time shape annual plant life cycles over multiple generations, we established naturally dispersing populations of recombinant inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana segregating early and late alleles for seed dormancy and flowering time in a field experiment. We recorded seasonal phenology and fitness of each genotype over 2\u00a0yr and several generations. Strong seed dormancy suppressed mid-summer germination in both early- and late-flowering genetic backgrounds. Strong dormancy and late-flowering genotypes were both necessary to confer a winter annual life history; other genotypes were rapid-cycling. Strong dormancy increased within-season fecundity in an early-flowering background, but decreased it in a late-flowering background. However, there were no detectable differences among genotypes in population growth rates. Seasonal phenology, life history, and cohort fitness over multiple generations depend strongly upon interacting genetic variation for dormancy and flowering. However, similar population growth rates across generations suggest that different life cycle genotypes can coexist in natural populations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50e3cf058f6100031cc","authors":["Taylor, Mark A.","Cooper, Martha D.","Sellamuthu, Reena","Braun, Peter","Migneault, Andrew","Browning, Alyssa","Perry, Emily","Schmitt, Johanna"],"doi":"10.1111\/nph.14712","first_seen_on":"2017-07-29T10:31:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0028-646X","1469-8137"],"journal":"New Phytologist","last_mentioned_on":1501747638,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28752957?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nph.14712\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nph.14712\/pdf","pmid":"28752957","pubdate":"2017-07-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Interacting effects of genetic variation for seed dormancy and flowering time on phenology, life history, and fitness of experimental Arabidopsis thaliana\n populations over multiple generations in the field","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interacting-effects-genetic-variation-seed-dormancy-flowering-time-phenology-life-history-fitness-ex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":4187782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3916340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184008,"mean":11.838871260332,"rank":91371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":84424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184008,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3638,"mean":8.0905086609843,"rank":2835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3638,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":14.809008849558,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
