Because of the many variations in its initial clinical manifestations, however, its diagnosis at times can be difficult. In this review, we describe nonclassic manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome and discuss the differential diagnosis, the importance of electrodiagnostic studies, and treatment modalities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000307b","authors":["ROBERT J.
