However, its performance will be degraded in the presence of significant model errors and uncertain interferences. In the literature, the fading filter was proposed to control the influences of the model errors, and the H-infinity filter can be adopted to address the uncertainties by minimizing the estimation error in the worst case. In this paper, a new multiple fading factor, suitable for the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Inertial Navigation System (INS) integrated navigation system, is proposed based on the optimization of the filter, and a comprehensive filtering algorithm is constructed by integrating the advantages of the H-infinity filter and the proposed multiple fading filter. Measurement data of the GPS\/INS integrated navigation system are collected under actual conditions. Stability and robustness of the proposed filtering algorithm are tested with various experiments and contrastive analysis are performed with the measurement data. Results demonstrate that both the filter divergence and the influences of outliers are restrained effectively with the proposed filtering algorithm, and precision of the filtering results are improved simultaneously.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Chen Jiang","Shu-Bi Zhang","Qiu-Zhao Zhang"],"doi":"10.3390\/s17061254","first_seen_on":"2017-06-01T08:58:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"6","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1496307493,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/6\/1254?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/6\/1254\/pdf","pmid":"28587157","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Adaptive Estimation of Multiple Fading Factors for GPS\/INS Integrated Navigation Systems","type":"article","volume":"17"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":6299420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1123504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240559,"mean":12.131810731715,"rank":169665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240559,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3423,"mean":1.968561659848,"rank":1873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1021,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3423,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":399,"mean":2.1742311557789,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":399,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/870202816609910784","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20747491],"posted_on":"2017-06-01T08:58:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/891043583511470080\/FfBKDjay_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
