It confines surgery to a single operative field under the same regional anesthesia and tourniquet as the primary hand surgical procedure while at the same time allowing wide visualization for harvesting bone graft. It provides cancellous bone of sufficient quality and quantity for use in most hand surgical cases. The technique has so far been used in 80 patients and has proven to be very safe.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008ae8","authors":["Oleksandra Vyrva","Sunil M.
