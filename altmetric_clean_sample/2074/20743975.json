However, survival effect of NGA0187 on the primary culture of cerebral cortical neurons was not observed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b62","authors":["Nozawa, Yuriko","Sakai, Noriyoshi","Matsumoto, Keita","Mizoue, Kazutoshi"],"first_seen_on":"2017-06-01T05:31:22+00:00","issns":["0021-8820"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Antibiotics","last_mentioned_on":1500746794,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12243452"],"pmid":"12243452","pubdate":"2002-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"A novel neuritogenic compound, NGA0187.","type":"article","volume":"55"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255259,"mean":6.9732582659374,"rank":2105530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5024356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255259,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237934,"mean":12.023203725418,"rank":78027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":157483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237934,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":892,"mean":4.257063973064,"rank":246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":892,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":0.67678571428571,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"List of neurosteroids","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=791821988#altmetric_citation_063aed97-220c-47da-94bc-bda057b2494a","license":"public","citation_ids":[20743975],"posted_on":"2017-07-22T18:06:34+00:00","summary":"This is a list of neurosteroids, or natural and synthetic steroids that are active on the nervous system.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=28006061","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Medgirl131","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Medgirl131"}},{"title":"NGA0187","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=783269530#altmetric_citation_c4662aef-e0a2-43c8-8165-4cc50b3264dd","license":"public","citation_ids":[20743975],"posted_on":"2017-06-01T05:31:17+00:00","summary":"NGA0187 is a naturally occurring lanostane steroid produced by Acremonium sp.
