Specifically, the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) seems to be higher in HIV-infected patients and an accurate risk prediction of CAD is of high importance for optimal long term treatment. In this study, we assessed the correlation of the endoPAT, which is an office-based CVD screening tool with the myocardial perfusion reserve by (82)-rubidium PET\/CT. We measured the reactive hyperemia index, which is a measure of the endothelial responsiveness, by the use of an endoPAT device (Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel) in 48 ART treated HIV-infected patients with high CD 4 cell counts and viral suppression (HIV-RNA < 20 copies\/mL), who had previously undergone measurement of the myocardial perfusion reserve by (82)-rubidium PET\/CT for study purposes. We found an inverse correlation between the reactive hyperemia index and the myocardial perfusion reserve which most likely indicates different vascular physiology. This study did not find evidence to suggest the immediate implementation of the reactive hyperemia index as a screening tool for early coronary artery disease in well-treated HIV-infected patients pending further validation in larger prospective studies.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef652a83ee09648b4f07","authors":["Mathilde \u00d8rb\u00e6k","Philip Hasbak","Rasmus Sejersten Ripa","Andreas Kj\u00e6r","Anne-Mette Lebech","Andreas Knudsen"],"doi":"10.3390\/diagnostics7020031","first_seen_on":"2017-06-01T09:53:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2075-4418"],"issue":"2","journal":"Diagnostics","last_mentioned_on":1496310797,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2075-4418\/7\/2\/31"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2075-4418\/7\/2\/31\/pdf","pmid":"28561781","pubdate":"2017-05-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Comparison of the Peripheral Reactive Hyperemia Index with Myocardial Perfusion Reserve by 82Rb PET\/CT in HIV-Infected Patients","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-peripheral-reactive-hyperemia-index-myocardial-perfusion-reserve-82rb-petct-hivinfected-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":6299420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1123505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240559,"mean":12.131811563116,"rank":169665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240559,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":2.995152,"rank":105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.5676470588235,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/diagnostic_mdpi\/statuses\/870216671696363520","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20748282],"posted_on":"2017-06-01T09:53:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Diagnostics_MDPI","url":"https:\/\/t.co\/PiRSGZVgig","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/647343179776159748\/SauzDOyF_normal.png","description":"An #openaccess journal on medical #diagnostics in #WoS, full-text archived in #PubMed Central, published by @MDPIOpenAcess.","id_on_source":"diagnostic_mdpi","tweeter_id":"3679683390","followers":59},"tweet_id":"870216671696363520"}]}}
