This study is reported in accordance with the PRISMA Statement. Nine databases were screened: PubMed (MedLine), Lilacs, IBECS, BBO, Web of Science, Scopus, SciELO, Google Scholar, and The Cochrane Library. Additionally, the following patent applications were searched online in Questel Orbit (Paris, France), USPTO, EPO, JPO, INPI, and Patentscope databases. A total of 716 papers and 83 patents were included. Calcium hydroxide was the main type of material studied, especially for direct pulp capping, followed by MTA. Patents related to adhesives or resins increased from 1998 e 2008, while in the last years, a major increase was observed in bioactive materials (containing bioactive proteins), materials derived from MTA (calcium silicate, calcium phosphate and calcium aluminate-based cements) and MTA. It was possible to obtain a scientific and technological overview of pulp capping materials. MTA has shown favorable results in vital pulp therapy that seem to surpass the disadvantages of calcium hydroxide. Recent advances in bioactive materials and those derived from MTA have shown promising results that could improve biomaterials used in vital pulp treatments. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
