Recent studies showed that A. caulinodans ORS571, as endophytic rhizobium, disseminated and colonized inside of cereal plants. However, how this rhizobium infects monocot plants and the regulatory mechanism remains unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional levels. In this study, we employed laser scanning confocal microscope to monitor the pathway that rhizobium invade wheat; we also investigated the potential role of miRNAs during A. caulinodans ORS571 infecting wheat. Our results showed that gfp-labeled A. caulinodans ORS571 infected wheat root hairs and emerged lateral roots, then disseminated and colonized within roots and migrated to other plant tissues, such as stems and leaves. Endophytic rhizobium induced the aberrant expression of miRNAs in wheat with a tissue- and time-dependent manner with a peak at 12-24\u00a0h after rhizobium infection. Some miRNAs, such as miR167 and miR393 responded more in roots than that in shoots. In contrast, miR171 responded higher in shoots than that in roots. These results suggested that miRNAs could be responsive to A. caulinodans ORS571 infection and played important role in plant growth, nutrient metabolisms, and wheat-rhizobium interactions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000291a","authors":["Li Qiu","Qiang Li","Junbiao Zhang","Yongchao Chen","Xiaojun Lin","Chao Sun","Weiling Wang","Huawei Liu","Baohong Zhang"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10142-016-0534-8","first_seen_on":"2017-06-01T10:38:38+00:00","issns":["1438-793X","1438-7948"],"journal":"Functional & Integrative Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1501808209,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27858182?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10142-016-0534-8"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10142-016-0534-8.pdf","pmid":"27858182","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","genetics"],"title":"Migration of endophytic diazotroph Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571 inside wheat (Triticum aestivum L) and its effect on microRNAs","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/migration-endophytic-diazotroph-azorhizobium-caulinodans-ors571-inside-wheat-triticum-aestivum-l-eff"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":4189791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3917151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241477,"mean":12.305541478242,"rank":121635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":109660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241477,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191,"mean":1.5025578947368,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.025,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
