All children completed the interpersonal reactivity index (IRI), a self-reported empathy questionnaire, and performed the \"faux-pas\" recognition task (FPR). Children with ADHD performed the task with and without MPH.\nChildren with ADHD showed significantly lower levels of self-reported empathy on most IRI subscales. FPR scores were significantly lower in children with ADHD and were improved, following the administration of MPH, to a level equal to that found in healthy controls.\nChildren with ADHD show impaired self-reported empathy and FPR when compared with healthy controls. Stimulants improve FPR in children with ADHD to a level equal to that in healthy controls.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6203cf058f610007b88","authors":["Maoz, Hagai","Gvirts, Hila Z.","Sheffer, Maya","Bloch, Yuval"],"doi":"10.1177\/1087054717710766","first_seen_on":"2017-06-01T08:38:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1087-0547","1557-1246"],"journal":"Journal of Attention Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1496702484,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28558473","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/1087054717710766#.WTXeBiONoZ8.twitter"],"pmid":"28558473","pubdate":"2017-06-01T22:11:56+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Theory of Mind and Empathy in Children With ADHD","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/theory-mind-empathy-children-adhd"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":6016438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2006741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241477,"mean":12.30557046663,"rank":156313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":70991,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241477,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":726,"mean":5.2233048275862,"rank":477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":726,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":3.86,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":3,"Philosophy":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PaulWhiteleyPhD\/statuses\/870197737278537728","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20747209],"posted_on":"2017-06-01T08:38:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Paul Whiteley","url":"http:\/\/questioning-answers.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000344449848\/35f9d576889f4cf18b0bcf1f367afa4f_normal.jpeg","description":"Autism research, research blogging & tweeting & health science stuff.
