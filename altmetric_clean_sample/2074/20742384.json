By combining the simulation techniques in different levels of accuracy, e.g. the bond-valence (BV) method and the density functional theory (DFT), a high-throughput design and optimization scheme is proposed for searching fast lithium ion conductors as candidate solid state electrolytes for lithium rechargeable batteries. The screening from more than 1000 compounds is performed through BV-based method, and the ability to predict reliable tendency of the Li(+) migration energy barriers is confirmed by comparing with the results from DFT calculations. \u03b2-Li3PS4 is taken as a model system to demonstrate the application of this combination method in optimizing properties of solid electrolytes. By employing the high-throughput DFT simulations to more than 200 structures of the doping derivatives of \u03b2-Li3PS4, the effects of doping on the ionic conductivities in this material are predicted by the BV calculations. The O-doping scheme is proposed as a promising way to improve the kinetic properties of this materials, and the validity of the optimization is proved by the first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Ruijuan Xiao","Hong Li","Liquan Chen"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep14227","first_seen_on":"2017-06-01T02:44:27+00:00","issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1496330899,"links":["https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep14227"],"pmid":"26387639","pubdate":"2015-09-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Batteries","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Theory and computation","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Software","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"High-throughput design and optimization of fast lithium ion conductors by the combination of bond-valence method and density functional theory","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highthroughput-design-optimization-fast-lithium-ion-conductors-combination-bondvalence-method-densit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14,"score_history":{"1y":14,"6m":14,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":608550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7686082,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240560,"mean":12.131687137043,"rank":28977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":211378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240560,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36012,"mean":14.681057288051,"rank":5119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":30838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36012,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2950,"mean":15.623023397762,"rank":409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":2539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2950,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
