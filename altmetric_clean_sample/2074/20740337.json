Happy Reading! @RickSumner3 @BritMWils"],"citation":{"abstract":"We completed a systematic literature review of in vivo animal models that use arthrotomy-based methods to study particle-induced peri-implant osteolysis. The purpose of the review was to characterize the models developed to date, to determine the questions addressed, to assess scientific rigor and transparency and to identify gaps in knowledge. We probed three literature databases (Medline, Embase and Scopus) and found 77 manuscripts that fit the search parameters. In the most recent 10 years, researchers mainly used rat and mouse models, whereas in the previous 20 years large animal, canine and rabbit models were more common. The studies have demonstrated several pathophysiology pathways, including macrophage migration, particle phagocytosis, increased local production of cytokines and lysosomal enzymes, elevated bone resorption and suppressed bone formation. The effect of variation in particle characteristics and concentration received limited attention with somewhat mixed findings. Particle contamination by endotoxin was shown to exacerbate peri-implant osteolysis. The possibility of early diagnosis was demonstrated through imaging and biomarker approaches. Several studies showed that both local and systemic delivery of bisphosphonates inhibits the development of particle-induced osteolysis. Other methods of inhibiting osteolysis include the use of anabolic agents and altering the implant design. Few studies examined non-surgical rescue of loosened implants, with conflicting results with alendronate. We found that the manuscripts often lacked the methodological detail now advocated by the ARRIVE guidelines, suggesting that improvement in reporting would be useful to maximize rigor and transparency.
