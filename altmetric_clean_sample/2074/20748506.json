Alternate splicing of the promoter is the regulatory mechanism of this gene. In the brain, estrogen is synthesized in neuronal and glial cells and the gene is mainly regulated by the alternate promoter PI.f. The hormone produced in this vicinity has been associated with maintaining normal brain functions. Previously, epigenetic regulation has been shown in the promoters PII and I.3 of CYP19 in adipocytes. In the present study, the methylation of PI.f in CYP19 was examined in glial cells. Treatment of the hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine increased CYP19 mRNA species in U87 MG cells while little changes were observed in the other glia cell lines. As PI.f is also chiefly used in T98G cells with high expression of CYP19, the methylation statuses of the promoter in these two cell models were compared. Our results showed that treating U87 MG cells with 10\u00a0\u03bcM 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine significantly induced a \u223c10-fold increase in CYP19 transcription and \u223c80% increase in aromatase activity. In contrast, the same treatment did not change either endpoint in T98G cells. Further investigation illustrated the CpGs in PI.f were differentially methylated in the two cell lines; 63% and 37% of the 14 CpG sites were methylated in U87 MG and T98G cells respectively. In conclusion, this study illustrated that the brain-specific PI.f derived CYP19 expression can be regulated by DNA methylation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310e","authors":["Tan, Wenjuan","Zhu, Zhiping","Ye, Lan","Leung, Lai K."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mce.2017.05.029","first_seen_on":"2017-06-01T10:04:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0303-7207","1872-8057"],"journal":"Molecular & Cellular Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1496334823,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28559115?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28559115?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28559115","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","endocrinology"],"title":"Methylation dictates PI.f-specific  CYP19  transcription in human glial cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/methylation-dictates-pifspecific-cyp19-transcription-human-glial-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":6299421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1123523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240559,"mean":12.131720109079,"rank":169663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240559,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1197,"mean":2.9932391304348,"rank":809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1197,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":0.94583333333333,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Epigenetica\/statuses\/870219367102939136","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20748506],"posted_on":"2017-06-01T10:03:59+00:00","author":{"name":"Epigen\u00e9tica","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/433553138323181568\/5dEMj3Sj_normal.jpeg","description":"Feed de noticias relevantes en el campo de la Epigen\u00e9tica (ES\/CAT\/EN).
