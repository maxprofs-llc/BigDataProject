At completion of the training, an interview was conducted to elicit participant's feedback regarding the effectiveness and feasibility of the training program. Seventeen of the 18 families agreed to participate. Most families (65%) attended three Reiki training sessions, reporting that Reiki benefitted their child by improving their comfort (76%), providing relaxation (88%), and pain relief (41%). All caregivers identified becoming an active participant in their child's care as a major gain from participation in the Reiki training. A hospital-based Reiki training program for caregivers of hospitalized pediatric patients is feasible and can positively impact patients and their families. More rigorous research regarding the benefits of Reiki in the pediatric population is needed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005829","authors":["Doorenbos, Ardith Z.","Kundu A","Dolan-Oves R","Dimmers MA","Towle CB","Doorenbos AZ"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ctcp.2012.08.001","endpage":"54","first_seen_on":"2013-01-10T15:25:56+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1744-3881","17443881"],"issue":"1","journal":"Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice","last_mentioned_on":1409860263,"links":["http:\/\/www.ctcpjournal.com\/article\/S1744-3881(12)00065-5\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ctcpjournal.com\/article\/S1744-3881%2812%2900065-5\/fulltext","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23337565\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ctcpjournal.com\/article\/S1744-3881(12)00065-5\/pdf","pmid":"23337565","pubdate":"2012-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"50","subjects":["nursing","obstetrics","complementarytherapies","perinatology"],"title":"Reiki training for caregivers of hospitalized pediatric patients: A pilot program.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reiki-training-caregivers-hospitalized-pediatric-patients-pilot-program-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.596,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.596},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7055086,"mean":6.2694738087465,"rank":423396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":6631837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7055086,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":292018,"mean":6.4737515213155,"rank":22178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":269840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":292018,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":353,"mean":6.1066420454545,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":353,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":13.3288,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
