The children learned to touch words on a screen in the correct sequence in order to see a corresponding animation, such as 'monkey flies'. The game progressed in levels from 2 to 4 word sequences, contingent upon success at each stage. Although performance was highly variable across participants, a detailed review of their learning profiles suggested that no child lacked syntactic awareness and that elementary syntactic control in a non-speech domain was superior to that manifest in their spoken language. The reasons for production failures at the level of speech in children with autism are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cb4","authors":["Karl Monsen","Maggie McGonigle-Chalmers","Ben Alderson-Day","Joanna Fleming"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10803-012-1753-z","first_seen_on":"2013-01-08T22:25:53+00:00","issns":["1573-3432","0162-3257"],"journal":"Journal of Autism & Developmental Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1377056112,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10803-012-1753-z","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10803-012-1753-z?no-access=true"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10803-012-1753-z","pmid":"23292162","pubdate":"2013-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Child and School Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry","pediatrics"],"title":"Profound Expressive Language Impairment in Low Functioning Children with Autism: An Investigation of Syntactic Awareness Using a Computerised Learning Task","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/profound-expressive-language-impairment-low-functioning-children-autism-investigation-syntactic-awar"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230817,"mean":5.9681223701699,"rank":1349399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":4856024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230817,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268766,"mean":6.6443776831062,"rank":71778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":195594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268766,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1994,"mean":8.4678976417461,"rank":964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1994,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":6.0069387755102,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
