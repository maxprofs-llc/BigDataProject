Although several patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics have been shown to contribute to locoregional recurrence (LRR), studies evaluating factors related to radiotherapy (XRT) technique have been limited. We investigated the relationship between LRR location and XRT fields and dose delivered to the primary breast cancer in women experiencing subsequent locoregional relapse.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b96","authors":["Torres, Mylin A."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijrobp.2012.06.008","first_seen_on":"2013-01-09T23:16:45+00:00","issns":["0360-3016"],"journal":"International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics","last_mentioned_on":1357817715,"links":["http:\/\/www.redjournal.org\/article\/PIIS0360301612007808\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=dlvr.it"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.redjournal.org\/article\/S0360-3016(12)00780-8\/pdf","pmid":"23312271","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["radiology","neoplasms","radiotherapy"],"title":"Radiation Field Design and Patterns of Locoregional Recurrence Following Definitive Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/radiation-field-design-patterns-locoregional-recurrence-following-definitive-radiotherapy-breast-can"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2309021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1583838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283823,"mean":5.949765085159,"rank":143650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":102933,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283823,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3306,"mean":1.6509222390318,"rank":1033,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3306,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320,"mean":1.3974106583072,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
