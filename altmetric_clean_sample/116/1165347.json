Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are drugs with analgesic and antipyretic effects, but in higher doses they have inflammatory effects. The pathogenesis of small intestinal damage caused by NSAID is unclear. The present study was performed to investigate the antiinflammatory effects of skimmed, sterilized, and concentrated bovine late colostrum on intestinal injury induced by side effects of NSAID, and then to identify the active ingredient in the colostrum for intestinal tissue. In Japan, the sale of bovine colostrum within 5 d after parturition is prohibited by law. Therefore, we focused on bovine late colostrum obtained from healthy lactating cows 6 to 7 d after parturition. Proliferation of small intestine epithelial cells was stimulated in mice fed the colostrum for 1 wk. With regard to indomethacin-induced enteropathy, both prefeeding and postfeeding with colostrum facilitated growth of the intestinal villi, indicating preventive and healing effects. Furthermore, to identify the active ingredient in the colostrum responsible for this effect, the casein and whey fractions were prepared from the colostrum and fed to normal mice. Only the colostrum casein fraction stimulated intestinal villus elongation, whereas the whey fraction and mature milk casein showed no such effect. Taken together, these observations indicate that the skimmed, sterilized, and concentrated bovine late colostrum, especially the casein fraction, could be used to treat the injurious effects of NSAID in the intestine and could be effective for treatment of other ulcerative conditions in the bowel, suggesting that the colostrum has therapeutic potential for intestinal inflammation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d4a","authors":["Cairangzhuoma","Yamamoto M","Muranishi H","Inagaki M","Uchida K","Yamashita K","Saito S","Yabe T","Kanamaru Y"],"doi":"10.3168\/jds.2012-5701","first_seen_on":"2013-01-09T14:25:55+00:00","issns":["1525-3198","0022-0302"],"journal":"Journal of Dairy Science","last_mentioned_on":1398320580,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23295115"],"pmid":"23295115","pubdate":"2013-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Skimmed, sterilized, and concentrated bovine late colostrum promotes both prevention and recovery from intestinal tissue damage in mice.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/skimmed-sterilized-concentrated-bovine-late-colostrum-promotes-both-prevention-recovery-intestinal-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.298,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.298},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":545896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":3961206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283822,"mean":5.9416074074858,"rank":42459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":241356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283822,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1727,"mean":1.9543035921205,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":1658,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1727,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":1.7183265306122,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
