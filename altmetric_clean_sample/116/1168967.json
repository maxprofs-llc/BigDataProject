In this study, the solution structure of the ADF\/cofilin from Trypanosoma brucei (TbCof) was determined by NMR spectroscopy. TbCof adopts the conserved ADF\/cofilin fold with a central \u03b2-sheet composed of six \u03b2-strands surrounded by five \u03b1-helices. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments denoted a submicromolar affinity between TbCof and G-actin, and the affinity between TbCof and ADP-G-actin was five times higher than that between TbCof and ATP-G-actin at low ionic strength. The results obtained from electron microscopy and actin filament sedimentation assays showed that TbCof depolymerized but did not co-sediment with actin filaments and its ability of F-actin depolymerization was pH independent. Similar to actin, TbCof was distributed throughout the cytoplasm. All our data indicate a structurally and functionally conserved ADF\/cofilin from Trypanosoma brucei.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Kun Dai","Shanhui Liao","Jiahai Zhang","Xuecheng Zhang","Xiaoming Tu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0053639","first_seen_on":"2013-01-10T22:51:37+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1357803349,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.plos.org\/~r\/plosone\/PLoSONE\/~3\/1vo1yB873Rg\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0053639"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0053639.pdf","pmid":"23326476","pubdate":"2013-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e53639","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Structural and Functional Insight into ADF\/Cofilin from Trypanosoma brucei","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-functional-insight-adfcofilin-trypanosoma-brucei"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634284,"mean":4.9206846148246,"rank":2897686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":82634,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634284,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279366,"mean":5.7241680095933,"rank":222381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279366,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64111,"mean":8.2653463734208,"rank":50204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64111,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6415,"mean":6.2319451200499,"rank":4647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6415,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
