Drawing on life-history theory, we propose that cues indicating that the current environment is harsh (e.g., news about an economic crisis, the sight of people facing adversity in life) lead people to perceive that resources in the world are scarce. As a consequence, people seek and consume more filling and high-calorie foods, which they believe will sustain them for longer periods of time. Although perceptions of harshness can promote unhealthy eating, we show how this effect can be attenuated and redirected to promote healthier food choices.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033de","authors":["Anthony Salerno","Juliano Laran","Laran J","Salerno A"],"doi":"10.1177\/0956797612450033","endpage":"173","first_seen_on":"2013-01-10T13:35:10+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1467-9280","0956-7976"],"issue":"2","journal":"Psychological Science (Sage Publications Inc.)","last_mentioned_on":1503421130,"links":["http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/01\/09\/0956797612450033.abstract","http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/01\/09\/0956797612450033","http:\/\/m.pss.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/01\/09\/0956797612450033.abstract?rss=1?rss=1?rss=1","http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/01\/09\/0956797612450033.long","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23302296","http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/24\/2\/167.abstract","http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/01\/09\/0956797612450033.full.pdf","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/0956797612450033"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/01\/09\/0956797612450033.full.pdf","pmid":"23302296","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"167","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Life-History Strategy, Food Choice, and Caloric Consumption","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lifehistory-strategy-food-choice-caloric-consumption"},"altmetric_score":{"score":78.858,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":78.858},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":115699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8298721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300138,"mean":6.8963798398731,"rank":4030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":296108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300138,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3155,"mean":51.679400760938,"rank":572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":2583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3155,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":308,"mean":86.352762214984,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":308,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":13,"researcher":4,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":13,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Ph.
