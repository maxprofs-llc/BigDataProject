The carbon electrodes were initially functionalized through cyclic-voltammetric reduction of a nitro-aryl diazonium moiety, followed by further reduction of nitro groups to amino groups, and finally by treatment with glutaraldehyde. Functionalization (probe immobilization) using Gamma phages was verified by XPS and TOF-SIM experiments. The Gamma phage-modified microarrays were then used to detect B. anthracis Sterne bacteria in aqueous electrolyte media. Faradaic impedimetric detection of bacteria in KCl solution containing the ferri\/ferro cyanide redox couple shows a gradual increase in Z' (real impedance) values, taken from the extrapolation of the linear portion of Nyquist plots in the low frequency range, for sensors placed in contact with increasing concentrations of B. anthracis. \u0394Z' values vary from 700 to 5300 Ohms for bacteria concentrations ranging from 10(2) to 10(8) cfu mL(-1). These shifts in Z' are attributed to a decrease in diffusion controlled charge transfer to the electrode surface following capture of intact B. anthracis. No significant \u0394Z' was observed for control experiments using E. coli. K12 as a non-specific target, even at a concentration of 10(8) cfu mL(-1).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002247","authors":["Arghavan Shabani","Christophe Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Marquette","Rosemonde Mandeville","M F Lawrence","Christophe A.
