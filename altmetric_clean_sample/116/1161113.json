However, programs involving resource intensive one-to-one clinical intervention are not readily available or deliverable in the community, resulting in many children with ASD missing out on evidence-based intervention during their early and most critical preschool years. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the ESDM for preschool-aged children with ASD using a predominantly group-based intervention in a community child care setting.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b3","authors":["Eapen V","Rn Ec R","Walter A","Valsamma Eapen","Rudi \u010crn\u010dec","Amelia Walter"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2431-13-3","first_seen_on":"2013-01-08T14:05:18+00:00","issns":["1471-2431",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1469766077,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2431\/13\/3\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23294523"],"pmid":"23294523","pubdate":"2013-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"3","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Clinical outcomes of an early intervention program for preschool children with Autism Spectrum Disorder in a community group setting","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2431-13-3","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-outcomes-early-intervention-program-preschool-children-autism-spectrum-disorder-community-g-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154593,"mean":6.8923629076653,"rank":2060864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4964722,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154593,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":297973,"mean":6.8288212717973,"rank":85873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":202882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":297973,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1094,"mean":5.2029899359561,"rank":361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1094,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":5.80665,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
