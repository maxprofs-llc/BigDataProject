With the increase in its indications in various local conditions, more complications have been observed. Among these, one of the most frequent is the installation of the implants in a three-dimensional altered position, making the prosthesis and aesthetics more difficult to achieve. For this reason, techniques such as segmental osteotomy have been developed and adapted to implantology to reestablish the adequate position of these implants with correct aesthetic outcome and function. The present clinical report shows the segmental osteotomy technique in a malposed osseointegrated dental position of the upper central incisor with 1-year follow-up.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c24","authors":["Netto HD","Olate S","Mazzonetto R"],"doi":"10.1097\/scs.0b013e31824e2624","first_seen_on":"2013-01-09T11:08:44+00:00","issns":["1049-2275"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Craniofacial Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1357729700,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22976653?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22976653","pubdate":"2012-09-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Surgical repositioning of osseointegrated malposed dental implant with segmental osteotomy.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/surgical-repositioning-osseointegrated-malposed-dental-implant-segmental-osteotomy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9199431259457,"rank":2900976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279259,"mean":5.7241415894981,"rank":222442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":930,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279259,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2088,"mean":1.2407973167226,"rank":1970,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2088,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":1.1115942028986,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
