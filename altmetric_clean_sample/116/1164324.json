This cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from 2259 children between 3 and 10 years of age who were sampled for the development of the Parent Mealtime Action Scale. No child gender differences were found in mothers' feeding practices. Older children received more Fat Reduction and Many Food Choices, but less Positive Persuasion, Use of Rewards, Insistence on Eating, and Special Meals, with differences in these feeding practices being most notable from before to after school age. Overweight children received less Insistence on Eating and more Fat Reduction than underweight or normal weight children. Children with the lowest family incomes received less Fat Reduction, less Daily FV Availability, more Use of Rewards. Results suggest that mothers respond to changing conditions, possibly including feedback from school nurses, increases in children's weight status, and availability of financial resources.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c3","authors":["Hendy HM","Williams KE"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.appet.2012.01.011","first_seen_on":"2013-01-09T03:53:09+00:00","issns":["0195-6663","01956663"],"journal":"Appetite","last_mentioned_on":1327573565,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSCONTENT&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0195666312000128&_version=1&md5=82c94554b03d78e58ae96f8602f52e37&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"22269792","pubdate":"2012-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Mother\u2019s feeding practices for children 3\u201310years of age and their associations with child demographics ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mothers-feeding-practices-children-310years-age-associations-child-demographics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628172,"mean":4.9437236464363,"rank":2904482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628172,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279170,"mean":5.7487429048354,"rank":223070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279170,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1130,"mean":11.251153232949,"rank":989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1130,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":8.5212564102564,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
