They have also been proposed as potential markers for more than a dozen pathologies. Moreover, EPCs have arisen as a new therapeutic option for cardiovascular disease. However nowadays there is certain controversy about their roles and a better understanding of EPC biology is required to develop new strategies for forthcoming therapies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["Mourino-Alvarez L","Calvo E","Moreau J","Padial LR","Lopez JA","Barderas MG","Gil-Dones F"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbagen.2012.12.014","first_seen_on":"2013-01-09T23:25:48+00:00","issns":["0006-3002"],"issue":"","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1357773941,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23274525"],"pmid":"23274525","pubdate":"2013-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Proteomic Characterization of EPCs and CECs \"in vivo\" from Acute Coronary Syndrome patients and Control subjects.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proteomic-characterization-epcs-cecs-vivo-acute-coronary-syndrome-patients-control-subjects-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3077259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":955982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283823,"mean":5.9497453544827,"rank":193075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":54526,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283823,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4624,"mean":2.3567627081981,"rank":3217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4624,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":1.5532527472527,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
