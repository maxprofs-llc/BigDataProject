This relationship was investigated. Selection of a dual-tropic (T cells and macrophages) virus to replicate in CD4+ brain cells results in loss of macrophage tropism and of neutralization by an anti-V3 loop monoclonal antibody. Moreover, selection of the brain-selected variant to escape from V3 loop-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies results in the reduction or loss of brain cell tropism and the reacquisition of macrophage tropism. These data may indicate that the antigenic diversification of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 apparent after seroconversion can be selected either by immune responses or by colonization of new cell types.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["A McKnight","R A Weiss","C Shotton","Y Takeuchi","H Hoshino","P R Clapham"],"first_seen_on":"2017-09-26T21:37:14+00:00","issns":["0022-538X","1098-5514"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1506461821,"links":["http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/69\/5\/3167.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/69\/5\/3167.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC189019","pmid":"7707545","pubdate":"1995-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Change in tropism upon immune escape by human immunodeficiency virus.","type":"article","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/change-tropism-upon-immune-escape-human-immunodeficiency-virus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":1,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":4523099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2357819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114572,"mean":11.472673259376,"rank":61194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":41332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114572,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6977,"mean":4.3453331422018,"rank":4064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6977,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":6.0968958333333,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
