Age associated alterations in the composition and function of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) may contribute to cardiovascular mortality. The effect of advanced age on the composition and function of HDL is not well understood. HDL was isolated from healthy young and elderly subjects. HDL composition, cellular cholesterol efflux\/uptake, anti-oxidant properties and paraoxonase activity were assessed. We observed a 3-fold increase of the acute phase protein serum amyloid A, an increased content of complement C3 and proteins involved in endopeptidase\/protease inhibition in HDL of elderly subjects, whereas levels of apolipoprotein E were significantly decreased. HDL from elderly subjects contained less cholesterol but increased sphingomyelin. Most importantly, HDL from elderly subjects showed defective antioxidant properties, lower paraoxonase 1 activity and was more rapidly taken up by macrophages, whereas cholesterol efflux capability was not altered. These findings suggest that aging alters HDL composition, resulting in functional impairment that may contribute to the onset\/progression of cardiovascular disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["Holzer M","Trieb M","Konya V","Wadsack C","Heinemann A","Marsche G"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbalip.2013.06.004","endpage":"1448","first_seen_on":"2013-06-28T13:14:07+00:00","funders":["fwf"],"issns":["0006-3002","13881981"],"issue":"9","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1372418160,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23792422"],"pmid":"23792422","pubdate":"2013-06-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Authors","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1442","subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Aging affects high-density lipoprotein composition and function.","type":"article","volume":"1831","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aging-affects-highdensity-lipoprotein-composition-function"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.608,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.608},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3683995,"mean":4.8997159343948,"rank":371836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":3311649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3683995,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85809,"mean":7.1922018925975,"rank":11648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":74142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85809,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3870,"mean":2.552169552856,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":3801,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3870,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":1.9575737704918,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
