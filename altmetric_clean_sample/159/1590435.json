Nxt1 is essential for viability; using a partial loss of function allele, we reveal a role for this gene in tissue specific transcription. We show that many Drosophila melanogaster testis-specific mRNAs require Nxt1 for their accumulation. The transcripts that require Nxt1 also depend on a testis-specific transcription complex, tMAC. We show that loss of Nxt1 leads to reduced transcription of tMAC targets. A reporter transcript from a tMAC-dependent promoter is under-expressed in Nxt1 mutants, however the same transcript accumulates in mutants if driven by a tMAC-independent promoter. Thus, in Drosophila primary spermatocytes, the transcription factor used to activate expression of a transcript, rather than the RNA sequence itself or the core transcription machinery, determines whether this expression requires Nxt1. We additionally find that transcripts from intron-less genes are more sensitive to loss of Nxt1 function than those from intron-containing genes and propose a mechanism in which transcript processing feeds back to increase activity of a tissue specific transcription complex.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334a","authors":["Simona Caporilli","Yachuan Yu","Jianqiao Jiang","Helen White-Cooper"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pgen.1003526","first_seen_on":"2013-06-28T08:39:08+00:00","funders":["wellcome","bbsrc"],"issns":["1553-7404"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1372408713,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosgenetics.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1003526"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pgen.1003526.pdf","pmid":"23754955","pubdate":"2013-06-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e1003526","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"The RNA Export Factor, Nxt1, Is Required for Tissue Specific Transcriptional Regulation","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rna-export-factor-nxt1-required-tissue-specific-transcriptional-regulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3072302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":949764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89689,"mean":7.4378832396755,"rank":61557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":17192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89689,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4065,"mean":8.2494847440945,"rank":3380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":467,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4065,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141,"mean":11.811742857143,"rank":112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
