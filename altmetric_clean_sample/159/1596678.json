The TonB-ExbBD inner membrane complex is hypothesized to transfer energy to outer membrane (OM) iron transporters. Fluorescence microscopic characterization of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-TonB hybrid proteins revealed an unexpected, restricted localization of TonB in the cell envelope. Fluorescence polarization measurements demonstrated motion of TonB in living cells, which likely was rotation. By determining the anisotropy of GFP-TonB in the absence and presence of inhibitors, we saw the dependence of its motion on electrochemical force and on the actions of ExbBD. We observed higher anisotropy for GFP-TonB in energy-depleted cells and lower values in bacteria lacking ExbBD. However, the metabolic inhibitors did not change the anisotropy of GFP-TonB in \u0394exbBD cells. These findings demonstrate that TonB undergoes energized motion in the bacterial cell envelope and that ExbBD couples this activity to the electrochemical gradient. The results portray TonB as an energized entity in a regular array underlying the OM bilayer, which promotes metal uptake through OM transporters by a rotational mechanism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Jordan LD","Zhou Y","Smallwood CR","Lill Y","Ritchie K","Yip WT","Newton SM","Klebba PE"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1304243110","first_seen_on":"2013-07-01T19:08:57+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["0027-8424","1091-6490"],"issue":"28","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1372838400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23798405","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.1304243110"],"pmid":"23798405","pubdate":"2013-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Energy-dependent motion of TonB in the Gram-negative bacterial inner membrane.","type":"article","volume":"110","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/energydependent-motion-tonb-gramnegative-bacterial-inner-membrane"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626012,"mean":4.9497445252532,"rank":262974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":3360912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626012,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84981,"mean":7.2978828900918,"rank":9192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":75721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84981,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33568,"mean":13.68219834957,"rank":6731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":26790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33568,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":915,"mean":30.016164113786,"rank":385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":915,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
