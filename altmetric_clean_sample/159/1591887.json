This review addresses enzymes and cell organelles involved in the formation of xenobiotic-CoAs, the reactivity of such conjugates toward biological macromolecules, and in vitro and in vivo methodology to assess consequences of such reactivity. Further, the propensity of xenobiotic-CoAs to interfere with endogenous lipid metabolism, e.g., inhibition of \u03b2-oxidation or depletion of the CoA or carnitine pools, adds to the complexity of the potential contribution of XCAs to hepatotoxicity by a number of mechanisms in addition to those in common with the corresponding acyl glucuronides. On the basis of our review of the literature on xenobiotic-CoA conjugates, there appear to be a number of gaps in our understanding of the bioactivation of XCA both with respect to the mechanisms involved and the experimental approaches to distinguish between the role of acyl glucuronides and xenobiotic-CoA conjugates. These aspects are focused upon and described in detail in this review.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ec","authors":["Malin Darnell","Lars Weidolf","Malin Darnell ","Lars Weidolf "],"doi":"10.1021\/tx400183y","first_seen_on":"2013-06-28T21:43:42+00:00","issns":["0893-228X","1520-5010"],"journal":"Chemical Research in Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1483574400,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/tx400183y","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/tx400183y"],"pmid":"23790050","pubdate":"2013-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":" American Chemical Society ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"130621141811006","title":"Metabolism of Xenobiotic Carboxylic Acids \u2013 Focus on Coenzyme A Conjugation, Reactivity and Interference with Lipid Metabolism","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolism-xenobiotic-carboxylic-acids-focus-coenzyme-conjugation-reactivity-interference-lipid-meta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8047191,"mean":6.8378746593499,"rank":1691700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6343593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8047191,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125138,"mean":6.9726965166179,"rank":26800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":98079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125138,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1059,"mean":5.0661776937618,"rank":222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1059,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":4.39,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
