Now that the tools to generate and interrogate such complete data sets are widely used, much of the focus of biological research has begun to turn towards understanding systems as a whole, rather than studying their components in isolation. This very broadly defined systems approach is being deployed across a range of problems and scales of organisation, including many aspects of the animal sciences. Here I review selected examples of this systems approach as applied to poultry and livestock production, product quality and welfare.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069d8","authors":["Headon D","D.
