Our goal was to reconcile how people can promote system ideals such as equal opportunities for all and at the same time recognize that group-based disparities are, in part, due to these unfulfilled ideals. Three studies examined whether people perceived a discrepancy between a system's ideal goals and its achievement of those goals. Everyone endorsed these goal ideals more than they believed that the goals were being achieved; however, this discrepancy was larger for low-status people. The larger the perceived discrepancy, the more dissatisfied people were with the system and the more likely they were to support hierarchy-attenuating policies. Studies 2 and 3 also examined people's motivation for endorsing goal ideals. People of all statuses endorsed system ideals to promote an ideal system more than to legitimize the actual system (Study 2); however, high-status people were slightly more likely to endorse system ideals to legitimize the actual system than low-status people (Study 3). In summary, low-status people were more likely than high-status people to recognize discrepancies between system goals and system outcomes, show dissatisfaction with the American system, and prefer policies that would attenuate extant hierarchies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037a6","authors":["Zimmerman JL","Reyna C"],"doi":"10.1037\/a0032967","endpage":"23","first_seen_on":"2013-07-01T17:04:22+00:00","issns":["0022-3514 (Print)","0022-3514","1939-1315"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Personality & Social Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1474305164,"links":["https:\/\/my.apa.org\/apa\/idm\/login.seam?ERIGHTS_TARGET=http%3A%2F%2Fpsycnet.apa.org%2Fjournals%2Fpsp%2F105%2F1%2F1&AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED=true","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1037\/a0032967"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/journals\/psp\/105\/1\/1.pdf","pmid":"23815234","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Psychological Association","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Marketing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1","title":"The meaning and role of ideology in system justification and resistance for high- and low-status people.","type":"article","volume":"105","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/meaning-role-ideology-system-justification-resistance-high-lowstatus-people"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":2051541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6331163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126186,"mean":7.0485312992829,"rank":31191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":94603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126186,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5945,"mean":10.431232503365,"rank":2311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5945,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":24.312266666667,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
