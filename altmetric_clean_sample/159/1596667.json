Cardiac resynchronization therapy has become an essential therapeutic tool in the treatment of heart failure patients today. It is an optimal choice in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy; however, its role in the management of patients with other forms of cardiomyopathies is still under investigation. This article discusses the most recent evidence for the use of cardiac resynchronization therapy in cardiomyopathies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bb8","doi":"10.2459\/jcm.0b013e3283637ff2","first_seen_on":"2013-07-01T19:04:54+00:00","issns":["1558-2027"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Cardiovascular Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1394182456,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcardiovascularmedicine\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Cardiac_resynchronization_therapy_in.99113.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcardiovascularmedicine\/Abstract\/2014\/02000\/Cardiac_resynchronization_therapy_in.2.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcardiovascularmedicine\/9000\/00000\/Cardiac_resynchronization_therapy_in.99113.pdf","pmid":"23811838","pubdate":"2013-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Cardiac resynchronization therapy in cardiomyopathies","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-cardiomyopathies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3071048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":947823,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89511,"mean":7.4400661825496,"rank":61231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":17215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89511,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":825,"mean":0.83917475728155,"rank":249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":825,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":0.71612903225806,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
