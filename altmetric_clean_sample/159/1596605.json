A total of 51 patients with tongue cancer (TCa) and 56 patients with gingival carcinoma (GCa) satisfying the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to two groups: the experiment group (EG) and the control group (CG). The EG group received multipoint injections of rAd-p53 into the surgical wound surface at a dose of 1 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u00b2 viral particles after a radical resection. Patients in both EG and CG were given radiotherapy at a total dose of 60 Gy at 3 weeks after surgery. All these patients were followed up for at least 3 years. Two cases (2\/27) of TCa and 2 (2\/30) in GCa patients had a local recurrence in EG, but 8 (8\/24) TCa and 8 (8\/26) GCa patients in CG had a local recurrence. Both recurrent rates of TCa (33.3%) and GCa (30.8%) in CG are statistically significantly higher than those of TCa (7.4%) and GCa (6.7%) in EG, respectively. The overall recurrent rate in EG is 7%, which is also statistically significantly lower than that (32%) in CG. The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate and 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate of EG is 100% and 93%, respectively. The 3-year OS and DFS rates of CG are 94 and 68%, respectively. Mild or medium fever and flu-like symptoms were more frequently observed in EG and were considered to be associated with application of rAd-p53. Post-tumorectomy wound surface injection of rAd-p53 combining with radiotherapy is a safe and effective regimen for the patients with TGa or GCa.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000249b","authors":["Liu, S","Chen, P","Hu, M","Tao, Y","Chen, L","Liu, H","Wang, J","Luo, J","Gao, G"],"doi":"10.1038\/cgt.2013.30","first_seen_on":"2013-07-01T18:27:24+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1476-5500"],"issue":"6","journal":"Cancer Gene Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1372703185,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23722592"],"pmid":"23722592","pubdate":"2013-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","geneticsmedical"],"title":"Randomized, controlled phase II study of post-surgery radiotherapy combined with recombinant adenoviral human p53 gene therapy in treatment of oral cancer.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/randomized-controlled-phase-ii-study-postsurgery-radiotherapy-combined-recombinant-adenoviral-human-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3071067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":947820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89511,"mean":7.4402633672217,"rank":61238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":17210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89511,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257,"mean":4.2455859375,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.3555555555556,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
