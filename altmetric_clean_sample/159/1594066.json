We compared baseline serum levels of 67 immune and inflammation markers between 301 patients with NHL diagnosed 5+ years after blood collection and 301 control patients within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. We observed associations with NHL for elevated B-cell-attracting chemokine 1 (BCA-1; fourth quartile vs first: odds ratio [OR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-4.2; Ptrend = 1.0 \u00d7 10(-6)), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (sTNFR2; OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.0-5.8; Ptrend = 1.1 \u00d7 10(-6)), and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (sVEGFR2; OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.9; Ptrend = .0005) that remained significant after Bonferroni correction, simultaneous model adjustment, and restriction to cases diagnosed 8 to 13 years after blood collection. Associations with other markers were observed, although none remained associated with NHL after adjustment for BCA-1, sTNFR2, and sVEGFR2. Our findings suggest that circulating BCA-1, sTNFR2, and sVEGFR2 are associated with NHL risk well in advance of diagnosis. Additional research is needed to replicate these findings and elucidate the underlying biologic mechanisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Mark P.
