However, further characterization and reconstitution of the precise neutralizing epitopes are complicated by the heterogeneity of glycosylation. We report here the design, synthesis and antigenic evaluation of new cyclic V1V2 glycopeptides carrying defined N-linked glycans at the conserved glycosylation sites (Asn160 and Asn156 or Asn173) derived from gp120 of two HIV-1 isolates. Antibody binding studies confirmed the necessity of a Man\u2085GlcNAc\u2082 glycan at Asn160 for recognition by PG9 and PG16 and further revealed a critical role of a sialylated N-glycan at the secondary site (Asn156 or Asn173) in the context of glycopeptides for antibody binding. In addition to defining the glycan specificities of PG9 and PG16, the identified synthetic glycopeptides provide a valuable template for HIV-1 vaccine design.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f610004264","authors":["Mohammed N Amin","Jason S McLellan","Wei Huang","Jared Orwenyo","Dennis R Burton","Wayne C Koff","Peter D Kwong","Lai-Xi Wang"],"doi":"10.1038\/nchembio.1288","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-07-01T21:50:35+00:00","funders":["niaid","nigms"],"issns":["1552-4450","1552-4469"],"journal":"Nature Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1418198004,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nchembio\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/nchembio.1288.html"],"pmid":"23831758","pubdate":"2013-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"","subjects":["chemistry","biology"],"title":"Synthetic glycopeptides reveal the glycan specificity of HIV-neutralizing antibodies","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthetic-glycopeptides-reveal-glycan-specificity-hivneutralizing-antibodies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7517247,"mean":6.5019263599956,"rank":1552988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5913599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7517247,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122291,"mean":6.7783301823535,"rank":25993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":95622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122291,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1576,"mean":16.064173968254,"rank":884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1576,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":17.0081875,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
