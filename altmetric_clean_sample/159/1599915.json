There has been little exploration of the fall event from the perspective of the individual who falls or their carers. Research has focused predominantly on personal risk factors, leaving the behavioural and contextual analysis of falls much less understood. This study aimed to identify these additional factors as well as briefly explore the fall experience for individuals and their carers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e04","authors":["Cahill S","Stancliffe RJ","Clemson L","Durvasula S"],"doi":"10.1111\/jir.12015","first_seen_on":"2013-07-03T00:31:40+00:00","issns":["0964-2633"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Intellectual Disability Research","last_mentioned_on":1372811487,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23373456"],"pmid":"23373456","pubdate":"2013-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Reconstructing the fall: individual, behavioural and contextual factors associated with falls in individuals with intellectual disability.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reconstructing-fall-individual-behavioural-contextual-factors-associated-falls-individuals-intellect"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628259,"mean":4.9430875566221,"rank":2904109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628259,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84917,"mean":7.2782159074852,"rank":67612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84917,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":324,"mean":3.1413188854489,"rank":277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":324,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.1071428571429,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
