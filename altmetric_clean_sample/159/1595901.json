For varus knees, the two most commonly performed valgus-producing HTOs are the lateral closing wedge and the medial opening wedge. Regardless of technique, some HTOs fail and are converted to TKA. To our knowledge, no studies have directly compared TKAs done after lateral closing-wedge osteotomies to those done after medial opening-wedge osteotomies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000256d","authors":["Stephen Preston","James Howard","Douglas Naudie","Lyndsay Somerville","James McAuley","Stephen Preston MDCM","James Howard MD, FRCSC","Douglas Naudie MD, FRCSC","Lyndsay Somerville PhD","James McAuley MD, FRCSC"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11999-013-3040-5","first_seen_on":"2013-07-01T13:13:29+00:00","issns":["0009-921X","1528-1132"],"journal":"Clinical Orthopaedics & Related Research","last_mentioned_on":1372704598,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s11999-013-3040-5","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs11999-013-3040-5"],"pmid":"23657880","pubdate":"2013-05-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Conservative Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sports Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgical Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Total Knee Arthroplasty After High Tibial Osteotomy: No Differences Between Medial and Lateral Osteotomy Approaches","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/total-knee-arthroplasty-after-high-tibial-osteotomy-differences-between-medial-lateral-osteotomy-app"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5204803,"mean":6.1401769108628,"rank":2242215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2892292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5204803,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95085,"mean":7.5852672373901,"rank":36055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":57551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95085,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2934,"mean":2.8767984998295,"rank":1266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2934,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":3.6188596491228,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
