Yet within many species, polymorphisms of the prion protein gene (Prnp) exist, each of which can further affect susceptibility or influence incubation period, pathology and phenotype. As strains are defined by these features (incubation period, pathology, phenotype), polymorphisms may also lead to the preferential propagation or generation of certain strains. In our recent study of the mouse Prnp(a) and Prnp(b) polymorphisms (which produced the proteins PrP(a) and PrP(b), respectively), we found differences in aggregation tendency, strain adaptability and conformational variability. Comparing our in vitro data with that of in vivo studies, we found that differing incubation periods between Prnp(a) and Prnp(b) mice can primarily be explained on the basis of faster or more efficient aggregation of PrP(a). In addition, and more importantly, we found that the faithful propagation of strains in Prnp(b) mice can be explained by the ability of PrP(b) to adopt a wider range of conformations. This adaptability allows PrP(b) to successfully propagate the structural features of a seed. In contrast, Prnp(a) mice revert PrP(b) strains into PrP(a) -type strains, and overall they have a narrower distribution of incubation periods. This can be explained by PrP(a) having fewer preferred conformations. We propose that Prnp polymorphisms are one route by which certain prion strains may preferentially propagate. This has significant implications for prion disease, chronic wasting disease (CWD) in particular, as it is spreading through North America. Deer which are susceptible to CWD also carry polymorphisms which influence their susceptibility. If these polymorphisms also preferentially allow strain diversification and propagation, this may accelerate the crossing of species barriers and propagation of the disease up the food chain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f6100085cb","authors":["Cortez LM","Sim VL"],"first_seen_on":"2013-07-02T13:47:22+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"4","journal":"Prion","last_mentioned_on":1372772831,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23807178"],"pmid":"23807178","pubdate":"2013-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Implications of prion polymorphisms.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/implications-prion-polymorphisms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3071048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":947807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89445,"mean":7.4421677474175,"rank":61142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":17246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89445,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195,"mean":1.5926701030928,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.65625,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
