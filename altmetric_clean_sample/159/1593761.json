Here we report the discovery of two additional modifications, N(6)-hydroxymethyladenosine (hm(6)A) and N(6)-formyladenosine (f(6)A), in mammalian messenger RNA. We show that Fe(II)- and \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) protein oxidize N(6)-methyladenosine to generate N(6)-hydroxymethyladenosine as an intermediate modification, and N(6)-formyladenosine as a further oxidized product. N(6)-hydroxymethyladenosine and N(6)-formyladenosine have half-life times of ~3 h in aqueous solution under physiological relevant conditions, and are present in isolated messenger RNA from human cells as well as mouse tissues. These previously unknown modifications derived from the prevalent N(6)-methyladenosine in messenger RNA, formed through oxidative RNA demethylation, may dynamically modulate RNA-protein interactions to affect gene expression regulation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Ye Fu","Guifang Jia","Xueqin Pang","Richard N.
