Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) is predominantly expressed in immune cells and displays anti-inflammatory and antifibrogenic effects. In the present study, we further investigated the mechanism underlying antifibrogenic properties of CB2 receptor and explored its effect on the profibrogenic properties of IL-17. After bile duct ligation (BDL), the hepatic expression of Th17 markers and IL-17 production were enhanced in CB2(-\/-) mice, as compared to wild-type (WT) counterparts, and correlated with increased fibrosis in these animals. In contrast, IL-22-induced expression was similar in both animal groups. Inhibition of Th17 differentiation by digoxin lowered Th17 marker gene expression and IL-17 production and strongly reduced liver fibrosis in CB2(-\/-) BDL mice. In vitro, differentiation of CD4(+) na\u00efve T cells into Th17 lymphocytes was decreased by the CB2 agonist, JWH-133, and was associated with reduced Th17 marker messenger RNA expression and IL-17 production, without modification of IL-22 release. The inhibitory effect of JWH-133 on IL-17 production relied on signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)5 phosphorylation. Indeed, STAT5 phosphorylation and translocation into the nucleus was enhanced in JWH133-treated Th17 lymphocytes, and the addition of a STAT5 inhibitor reversed the inhibitory effect of the CB2 agonist on IL-17 production, without affecting IL-22 levels. Finally, in vitro studies also demonstrated that CB2 receptor activation in macrophages and hepatic myofibroblasts blunts IL-17-induced proinflammatory gene expression. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that CB2 receptor activation decreases liver fibrosis by selectively reducing IL-17 production by Th17 lymphocytes via a STAT5-dependent pathway, and by blunting the proinflammatory effects of IL-17 on its target cells, while preserving IL-22 production.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f610007619","authors":["Guillot, Adrien","Hamdaoui, Nabila","Bizy, Alexandra","Zoltani, Keve","Souktani, Rachid","Zafrani, Elie\u2010Serge","Mallat, Ariane","Lotersztajn, Sophie","Lafdil, Fouad"],"doi":"10.1002\/hep.26598","endpage":"306","first_seen_on":"2013-06-28T20:27:33+00:00","issns":["1527-3350","0270-9139"],"issue":"1","journal":"Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1372446155,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/hep.26598&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/hep.26598\/pdf","pmid":"23813495","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"296","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Cannabinoid receptor 2 counteracts interleukin\u00e2\u0080\u009017\u00e2\u0080\u0090induced immune and fibrogenic responses in mouse liver","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cannabinoid-receptor-2-counteracts-interleukin17induced-immune-fibrogenic-responses-mouse-liver"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6701769,"mean":6.162931864545,"rank":5724000,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6701769,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119376,"mean":6.6782584293195,"rank":96428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119376,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3413,"mean":5.6765257913247,"rank":2889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3413,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":6.5982580645161,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
