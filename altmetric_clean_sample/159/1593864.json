The extent of the lesion is often large, without any injury to the knee. The meniscal tissue might be degenerative. However, a complete resection of the lesion would result in a subtotal meniscectomy. The purpose of this study was to consider the use of a meniscal repair in such patients in order to close the horizontal cleavage extending up to the avascular zone. The hypothesis was that the clinical outcomes after open meniscal repair of horizontal tears are good with a low rate of secondary meniscectomy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fc1","authors":["Nicolas Pujol","Yohann Bohu","Philippe Boisrenoult","Ali Macdes","Philippe Beaufils"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00167-012-2099-y","first_seen_on":"2013-06-30T08:13:38+00:00","issns":["1433-7347","0942-2056"],"journal":"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy","last_mentioned_on":1372578212,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00167-012-2099-y"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00167-012-2099-y.pdf","pmid":"22696145","pubdate":"2012-06-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","sportsmedicine"],"title":"Clinical outcomes of open meniscal repair of horizontal meniscal tears in young patients","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-outcomes-open-meniscal-repair-horizontal-meniscal-tears-young-patients-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228993,"mean":5.9654070340771,"rank":2686108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3492154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228993,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99761,"mean":7.5235849238172,"rank":44555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":53912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99761,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1012,"mean":3.9573788328388,"rank":511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":486,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1012,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":3.0147058823529,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
