Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study investigated the acute effects of pharmacological modulation of the serotonergic system on brain activation during response inhibition and re-engagement in healthy human volunteers. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design 14 men received either a single oral dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram (10mg) or a placebo. At the time of the expected plasma peak concentration, participants performed a stop-change task during fMRI. Escitalopram did not affect behavioural performance, since the main effect did not reveal significant differences between reaction times of go-, stop- or change-trials. During successful response inhibition, escitalopram, however, was associated with enhanced brain activation in right prefrontal cortex, right supplementary\/pre-motor and bilateral cingulate cortex, and subcortical regions. During inhibition failures, escitalopram also modulated a broad network of brain regions, including anterior cingulate, right parietal cortex, right orbitofrontal cortex, and areas in right temporal cortex and subcortical regions. During response re-engagement escitalopram increased brain activation in right inferior frontal gyrus and precuneus as well as in left middle temporal gyrus. The results implicate the involvement of 5-HT in neural regulation of response inhibition and re-engagement. This study also provides evidence that 5-HT affects both action restraint and action cancellation through modulation of activation of brain areas. The results support the view for a fronto-striatal circuitry for response inhibition in conjunction with serotonin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002862","authors":["Barbara Drueke","Sonja M.A. Schlaegel","Anke Seifert","Olaf Moeller","Gerhard Gr\u00fcnder","Siegfried Gauggel","Maren Boecker"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.euroneuro.2013.05.005","first_seen_on":"2013-06-29T14:15:05+00:00","issns":["0924977X"],"journal":"European Neuropsychopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1372512258,"links":["http:\/\/rss.sciencedirect.com\/action\/redirectFile?&zone=main&currentActivity=feed&usageType=outward&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0924977X13001491%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Db09e2f7a392d01dad9084d9ab82cd2e9","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0924977X13001491"],"pmid":"23816061","pubdate":"2013-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"title":"The role of 5-HT in response inhibition and re-engagement","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-5ht-response-inhibition-reengagement"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3071089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":947834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89506,"mean":7.4423263057931,"rank":61310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":17099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89506,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":870,"mean":2.8999539700806,"rank":506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":870,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":2.373,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
