We compared outcomes among haematology patients before and after changing our first-line neutropenic fever treatment from imipenem to PIP-TAZ. Forty-five patients received imipenem and 60 PIP-TAZ. Despite a higher rate of antibiotic modification in the PIP-TAZ cohort, treatment success and time to defervescence were similar, with a trend towards fewer Clostridium difficile infections in the PIP-TAZ cohort.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002afe","authors":["Roohullah A","Moniwa A","Wood C","Humble M","Balm M","Carter J","Weinkove R"],"doi":"10.1111\/imj.12226","first_seen_on":"2013-07-02T09:00:30+00:00","issns":["1444-0903"],"issue":"","journal":"Internal Medicine Journal","last_mentioned_on":1372755606,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23800137"],"pmid":"23800137","pubdate":"2013-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Imipenem versus piperacillin\/tazobactam for empiric treatment of febrile neutropenia in adults.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/imipenem-versus-piperacillintazobactam-empiric-treatment-neutropenic-fever-adults"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4724692,"mean":5.6963232575438,"rank":3956785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4724692,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91232,"mean":7.6176834190133,"rank":76117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91232,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":522,"mean":3.3526218809981,"rank":464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":522,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.5833333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
