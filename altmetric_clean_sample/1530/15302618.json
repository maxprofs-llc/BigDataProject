The functional motifs of Hmo1 include two HMG-like motifs, box A and box B, and a C-terminal tail. To elucidate the molecular roles of the HMG-like boxes in DNA binding in\u00a0vivo, we analyzed the DNA-binding activity of various Hmo1 mutants using ChIP or reporter assays that enabled us to conveniently detect Hmo1 binding to the promoter of RPS5, a major target gene of Hmo1. Our mutational analyses showed that box B is a bona fide DNA-binding motif and that it also plays other important roles in cell growth. However, box A, especially its first \u03b1-helix, contributes to DNA binding of Hmo1 by inducing self-assembly of Hmo1. Intriguingly, box A mediated formation of oligomers of more than two proteins on DNA in\u00a0vivo. Furthermore, duplication of the box B partially alleviates the requirement for box A. These findings suggest that the principal role of box A is to assemble multiple box B in the appropriate orientation, thereby stabilizing the binding of Hmo1 to DNA and nucleating specific chromosomal architecture on its target genes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293e","authors":["Kasahara, Koji","Higashino, Ayako","Unzai, Satoru","Yoshikawa, Hirofumi","Kokubo, Tetsuro"],"doi":"10.1111\/gtc.12449","endpage":"1352","first_seen_on":"2017-01-07T16:02:39+00:00","issns":["1365-2443"],"issue":"12","journal":"Genes to Cells","last_mentioned_on":1484034319,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gtc.12449\/full?hootPostID=e859290625261bd65365ad62e482336f","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gtc.12449\/full?hootPostID=8efdaa8499be524a448e5ff15b834bb9"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gtc.12449\/pdf","pmid":"27860073","pubdate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1333","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"\n              Oligomerization of Hmo1 mediated by box A is essential for DNA binding\n              in\u00a0vitro\n              and\n              in\u00a0vivo\n            ","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oligomerization-hmo1-mediated-box-essential-dna-binding-invitro-invivo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8038089,"mean":6.8236667777181,"rank":4008650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3825158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8038089,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254305,"mean":12.710994801497,"rank":132053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":112534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254305,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":615,"mean":3.3395342019544,"rank":338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":615,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.721875,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
