Correlation between HVPG and TE was analyzed using the Spearman's correlation test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were prepared for determining the utility of TE in predicting various stages of portal hypertension. The best cut-off value of TE for the diagnosis of CSPH was obtained using the Youden index.\nThe study included 326 patients [median age 52 (range 16-90) years; 81% males]. The most common etiology of cirrhosis was cryptogenic (45%) followed by alcohol (34%). The median HVPG was 16.0 (range 1.5 to 30.5) mmHg. Eighty-five percent of patients had CSPH. A significant positive correlation was noted between TE and HVPG (rho 0.361, P < 0.001). The area under ROC curve for TE in predicting CSPH was 0.740 (95%CI: 0.662-0.818) (P < 0.01). A cut-off value of TE of 21.6 kPa best predicted CSPH with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 93%.\nTE has a fair positive correlation with HVPG; thus, TE can be used as a non-invasive modality to assess the degree of portal hypertension. A cut-off TE value of 21.6 kPa identifies CSPH with a PPV of 93%.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d0f","authors":["Ashish Kumar","Noor Muhammad Khan","Shrihari Anil Anikhindi","Praveen
