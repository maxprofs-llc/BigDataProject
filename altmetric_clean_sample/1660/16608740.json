By using this hybrid technique; we are able to generate different patterns and geometries on the top surfaces of the biomaterials. The Talbot effect allows us to rapidly make microstructuring, solving the common problems of using microlenses for multipatterning; where the material expelled during the ablation of biomaterials damages the microlens. The Talbot effect permits us to increase the working distance and reduce the period of the patterns. We also demonstrate that the geometries and patterns act as anchor points for cells; affecting the cell adhesion to the metallic substrates and guiding how they spread over the material.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041bc","authors":["Mar\u00eda Aymerich","Daniel Nieto","Ezequiel \u00c1lvarez","Mar\u00eda Flores-Arias"],"doi":"10.3390\/ma10020214","first_seen_on":"2017-02-22T10:54:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1996-1944"],"issue":"2","journal":"Materials (1996-1944)","last_mentioned_on":1487759321,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/10\/2\/214?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/ma10020214"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/10\/2\/214\/pdf","pmid":"28772574","pubdate":"2017-02-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Laser Surface Microstructuring of Biocompatible Materials Using a Microlens Array and the Talbot Effect: Evaluation of the Cell Adhesion","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laser-surface-microstructuring-biocompatible-materials-using-microlens-array-talbot-effect-evaluatio-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":7139958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242693,"mean":13.702944456348,"rank":202283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242693,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1130,"mean":0.95231532329495,"rank":810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1130,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261,"mean":0.81384615384615,"rank":163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/834349182538231808","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16608740],"posted_on":"2017-02-22T10:28:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/891043583511470080\/FfBKDjay_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
