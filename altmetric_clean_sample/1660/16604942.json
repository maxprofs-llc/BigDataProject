The latest edition version of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) included in its Section 3 Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) as a condition for further empirical study and proposed nine criteria for the diagnosis of IGD. The 20-item Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD-20) Test was developed as a valid and reliable tool to assess gaming addiction based on the nine criteria set by the DSM-5. The aim of this study is to validate an Arabic version of the IGD-20 Test. The Arabic version of IGD-20 will not only help in identifying Arabic-speaking pathological gamers but also stimulate cross-cultural studies that could contribute to an area in need of more research for insight and treatment. After a process of translation and back-translation and with the participation of a sizable sample of Arabic-speaking adolescents, the present study conducted a psychometric validation of the IGD-20 Test. Our confirmatory factor analysis showed the validity of the Arabic version of the IGD-20 Test. The one-factor model of the Arabic IGD-20 Test had very good psychometric properties, and it fitted the sample data extremely well. In addition, correlation analysis between the IGD-20 Test and the daily duration on weekdays and weekends gameplay revealed significant positive relationships that warranted a criterion-related validation. Thus, the Arabic version of the IGD-20 Test is a valid and reliable measure of IGD among Arabic-speaking populations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c1","authors":["HawiNazir S.","SamahaMaya","Hawi, Nazir S.","Samaha, Maya"],"doi":"10.1089\/cyber.2016.0493","first_seen_on":"2017-02-22T08:41:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2152-2715","2152-2723"],"issue":"4","journal":"CyberPsychology, Behavior & Social Networking","last_mentioned_on":1497017913,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/cyber.2016.0493#utm_source=FastTrack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=cyber","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28394210?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28394210","pubdate":"2017-04-11T22:03:15+00:00","publisher":"Mary Ann Liebert Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","psychology"],"title":"Validation of the Arabic Version of the Internet Gaming Disorder-20 Test","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/validation-arabic-version-internet-gaming-disorder20-test"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":3619998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4603340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244738,"mean":13.720287770137,"rank":106836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":133772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244738,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":735,"mean":24.825291553134,"rank":448,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":735,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":18.7174,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
