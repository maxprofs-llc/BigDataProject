However, difficulty with intraoperative identification of the lesion may limit the ability to achieve the surgical objective of complete extirpation of these lesions. Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) may aid in FCD resections. The objective of this study is to compare rates of postoperative seizure freedom, completeness of resection, and need for reoperation in patients undergoing iMRI-assisted FCD resection versus conventional surgical techniques.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of pediatric subjects who underwent surgical resection of FCD at Children's National Medical Center between March 2005 and April 2015.\nAt the time of the last postoperative follow-up, 11 of the 12 patients (92\u00a0%) in the iMRI resection group were seizure free (Engel Class I), compared to 14 of the 42 patients (33\u00a0%) in the control resection group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0005). All 12 of the iMRI patients (100\u00a0%) achieved complete resection, compared to 24 of 42 patients (57\u00a0%) in the control group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). One (8\u00a0%) patient from the iMRI-assisted resection group has required reoperation, compared to 17 (40\u00a0%) patients in the control resection group.\nOur results suggest that the utilization of iMRI during surgery for resection of FCD results in improved postoperative seizure freedom, completeness of lesion resection, and reduction in the need for reoperation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002511","authors":["Matthew F.
