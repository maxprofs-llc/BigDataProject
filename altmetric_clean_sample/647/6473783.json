In continued efforts to investigate the metabolic potential of microbial populations from chemically underexplored sites, three new lipopeptides named iturin F\u2081, iturin F\u2082 and iturin A\u2089 (1-3), along with iturin A\u2088 (4), were isolated from Bacillus sp. KCB14S006 derived from a saltern. The structures of the isolated compounds were established by 1D-, 2D-NMR and HR-ESIMS, and their absolute configurations were determined by applying advanced Marfey's method and CD spectroscopy. All isolates exhibited significant antifungal activities against various pathogenic fungi and moderate cytotoxic activities toward HeLa and src(ts)-NRK cell lines. Moreover, in an in vitro enzymatic assay, compound 4 showed a significant inhibitory activity against indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f61000668a","authors":["Sangkeun Son"],"doi":"10.3390\/md14040072","first_seen_on":"2016-04-05T00:57:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1660-3397"],"issue":"4","journal":"Marine Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1459888759,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/14\/4\/72","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3390\/md14040072"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/14\/4\/72\/pdf","pmid":"27049393","pubdate":"2016-04-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"72","subjects":["biology","pharmacology"],"title":"New Cyclic Lipopeptides of the Iturin Class Produced by Saltern-Derived Bacillus sp.
