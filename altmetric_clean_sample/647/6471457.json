While previous studies have often relied on interviewing minority individuals who may or may not have been terminally ill and of whom few were using hospice care services, this essay draws upon the culture-centered approach to report the findings of a grounded theory analysis of 39 interviews with 26 African American hospice patients (n\u00a0=\u00a010) and lay caregivers (n\u00a0=\u00a016). Participants identified several barriers to hospice enrollment and reported how they were able to overcome these barriers by reframing\/prioritizing cultural values and practices, creating alternative goals for hospice care, and relying on information obtained outside the formal health system. These findings have implications for understanding hospice experiences, promoting hospice access, and improving end-of-life care.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f6100014ed","authors":["Patrick J.
