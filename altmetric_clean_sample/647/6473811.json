Some of the nonwords, like tain and goach, shared their VC unit with a number of real words. Other nonwords, like goan and taich, shared their VC unit with few or no real words. Pooling across items, the very same grapheme-phoneme correspondences occurred in the two types of nonwords. First graders, good and poor third grade readers, and adults all performed better on the nonwords with the more common VC units than on the nonwords with the less common VC units. Although readers appeared to use VC units in the pronunciation of nonwords, we did not find evidence for use of initial CV units. Implications of the results for reading development, dyslexia, and models of nonword pronunciation are discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5033cf058f6100030a9","authors":["Rebecca Treiman","Usha Goswami","Maggie Bruck","Treiman, R","Goswami, U","Bruck, M"],"doi":"10.3758\/bf03197098","endpage":"567","first_seen_on":"2016-04-05T01:00:28+00:00","issns":["0090-502X","1532-5946"],"issue":"6","journal":"Memory & Cognition","last_mentioned_on":1455898980,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2266857"],"pmid":"2266857","pubdate":"1990-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"559","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Not all nonwords are alike: Implications for reading development and theory","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/index\/10.3758\/BF03197098","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/not-nonwords-alike-implications-reading-development-theory"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8035137,"mean":6.8168182420277,"rank":1507978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6507942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8035137,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276402,"mean":11.324404122995,"rank":68850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":206882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276402,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":962,"mean":5.8840728407908,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":962,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":49.606380952381,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":3,"Professor":3},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":9,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Linguistics":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"NL":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Mojibake \u2013 The rehearsal of word fragments in verbal recall","url":"http:\/\/researchtoolsbox.blogspot.com\/2016\/02\/mojibake-rehearsal-of-word-fragments-in.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[21684457,21684457,21684447,21684457,21684457,21684457,21684457,21684457,21684457,21684457,430300,430300,111375,21684474,2453379,21684476,21684477,21684480,21684480,21684480,21684485,21684486,3125932,21684490,21684495,21684497,21684500,21684502,21684505,21684506,21684508,992994,4524144,4524144,21684511,21684512,10875062,10875062,21684513,21684513,12200558,12200558,1921406,1921406,105583,105583,21684521,21684521,21684526,21684526,14503865,14503865,21684536,21684539,21684540,5496545,3123888,5496477,5496477,21684546,21684546,21684546,1572821,1572821,1572821,178590,178590,178590,21684551,21684553,21684553,21684557,8202952,8202952,21684560,21684561,2658339,737984,737984,737984,21684566,21684567,21684568,21684568,4911194,237322,21684574,21684579,21684579,9855239,21684583,21684583,21684595,21684595,21684597,21684597,21684598,21684598,21684601,21684602,21684602,11948042,11948042,21684607,4425209,4425209,4160405,12100689,21684609,21684610,21684613,21684613,21684613,21684614,442011,21684615,6473811,21684616,21684622,21684622,21684623,696877,696877,21684625],"posted_on":"2016-02-19T16:23:00+00:00","summary":"&nbsp;Source: http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4399214\/Front Psychol. 2015; 6: 350.
