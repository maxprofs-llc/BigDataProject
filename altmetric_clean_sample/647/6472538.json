This study aimed to show whether deposition of seeds at gorilla ground nest sites conferred any advantage for germination and seedling establishment as compared to the fate of seeds deposited in gorilla dung on trails or under parents. Four tree species were chosen for study, which had a range of fruit types and fruiting patterns but which were all important foods for gorillas. Data showed that gorillas removed significant quantities of seeds from all four species and deposited them in dung at nest sites or on trail. Nest sites were not always favorable for germination, but the most favorable sites permitted the best survival and growth of any of the seedlings, including those deposited in dung on trail or scatter-dispersed under or away from parent canopies. Initial performance in the first few weeks after deposition was not always indicative of long-term survival and growth, so data collection over 1-2 years was absolutely essential. The main factors affecting seedling fate at nest sites appeared to be vegetation cover and desiccation. It is suggested that the nesting habits of gorillas are an additional factor encouraging the successful establishment of seedlings over and above the obvious advantages of large body size, gut capacity, and extended day ranges.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51a3cf058f610003894","authors":["Rogers, M E","Voysey, B C","McDonald, K E","Parnell, R J","Tutin, C E"],"doi":"10.1002\/(sici)1098-2345(1998)45:1<45::aid-ajp5>3.0.co;2-w","first_seen_on":"2016-04-04T23:30:48+00:00","issns":["0275-2565"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Primatology","last_mentioned_on":1459808331,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9573442"],"pmid":"9573442","pubdate":"1998-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Lowland gorillas and seed dispersal: the importance of nest sites.","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lowland-gorillas-seed-dispersal-importance-nest-sites"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7492829,"mean":6.4903949042968,"rank":921572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":6550918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7492829,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272155,"mean":11.16113781168,"rank":49669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":221957,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272155,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":998,"mean":7.2578335005015,"rank":187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":998,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":8.2414074074074,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":25,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
