There are some reports saying that TTN is associated with increased frequencies of wheezing attacks.\nThe aims of this study were to determine the risk factors associated with TTN and to determine the association between TTN and the development of wheezing syndromes in early life.\nIn a historical cohort study, we recorded the characteristics of 70 infants born at the Shohadaye Kargar Hospital in Yazd between March 2005 and March 2009 and who were hospitalized because of TTN in the neonatal intensive-care unit. We called their parents at least four years after the infants were discharged from the hospital and asked about any wheezing attacks. Seventy other infants with no health problems during the newborn period were included in the study as the control group.\nThe rate of wheezing attacks in newborns with TTN was more than patients with no TTN diagnosis (P = 0.014). TTN was found to be an independent risk factor for later wheezing attacks (relative risk [RR] = 2.8).\nThe most obvious finding of this study was that TTN was an independent risk factor for wheezing attacks. So long-term medical care is suggested for these patients who may be at risk, because TTN may not be as transient as has been previously thought.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f0d","authors":["Golshantafti, Mohammad","Yavari, Tahereh","Afrand, Mohammadhosain"],"doi":"10.5812\/ijp.2295","first_seen_on":"2016-02-06T12:47:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2008-2142"],"issue":"1","journal":"Iranian Journal of Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1454762825,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26848370?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4733286","pmid":"26848370","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Risk of Wheezing Attacks in Infants With Transient Tachypnea Newborns.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-wheezing-attacks-infants-transient-tachypnea-newborns"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7108255,"mean":6.3028542255213,"rank":5333029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":991837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7108255,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319312,"mean":9.4637298558456,"rank":220708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":55063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319312,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":1.8641777777778,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.32,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/asthma_papers\/statuses\/695951847169748993","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5102254],"posted_on":"2016-02-06T12:47:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Asthma Papers","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439482171208646656\/OWe4b0kE_normal.jpeg","description":"RSS feed for #asthma papers in #Pubmed.
