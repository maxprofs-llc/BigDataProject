Findings were used to cocreate culturally appropriate strategies to address the most significant family health concern.\nA focused ethnography within a participatory framework was employed. An advisory council, comprised of seven tribal members, guided the research team. A purposive sampling technique with a snowball process was used. Twenty-one adult tribal members volunteered to participate.\nFace-to-face, audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews were conducted and transcribed verbatim. Other data sources included field notes of approximately 100\u00a0hours of field work, windshield surveys, and a focus group. Data were analyzed using Spradley's guidelines.\nThe significant family health concern was \"diabetes runs rampant here\" with inter-related cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses. These responses were compounded by accumulated emotional trauma from witnessing premature deaths and severe comorbidities associated with diabetes. Contextual factors shaping \"diabetes runs rampant here\" were identified.\nHolistic approaches are urgently needed in diabetes prevention and management programs. Implications for public health nurses are discussed and recommendations are provided for future research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033f4","authors":["Martin, Donna","Yurkovich, Eleanor","Anderson, Kara"],"doi":"10.1111\/phn.12225","endpage":"81","first_seen_on":"2016-02-08T12:20:06+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1525-1446"],"issue":"1","journal":"Public Health Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1454939776,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/phn.12225#.VriGuilGU2A.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/phn.12225\/pdf","pmid":"26336881","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"73","subjects":["nursing","publichealth"],"title":"American Indians\u2019 Family Health Concern on a Northern Plains Reservation: \u201cDiabetes Runs Rampant Here\u201d","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/american-indians-family-health-concern-northern-plains-reservation-diabetes-runs-rampant"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8404249,"mean":7.0755536773704,"rank":3778425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4532965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8404249,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":336360,"mean":9.8081257168675,"rank":136405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":195174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":336360,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":417,"mean":2.8846586538462,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":417,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":3.4958333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1},"mendeley":{"PT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PublicNsg\/statuses\/696669762131095552","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5106829],"posted_on":"2016-02-08T12:19:49+00:00","author":{"name":"J Public Health Nsg","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/journal\/10.1111\/(ISSN)1525-1446","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/657553356265623552\/K-D4gVOr_normal.jpg","description":"Timely research and practice features targeting clinicians, administrators, and educators in the field of public health nursing.","id_on_source":"PublicNsg","tweeter_id":"3991444158","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":85},"tweet_id":"696669762131095552"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrJodiHall\/statuses\/696694033012301825","license":"gnip","rt":["PublicNsg"],"citation_ids":[5106829],"posted_on":"2016-02-08T13:56:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Jodi","url":"http:\/\/www.jodihall.ca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/861378019226787840\/Yqt22Emq_normal.jpg","description":"PhD, Doula Studies Professor, Research #sexwork #digitaltech #socialinclusion #repojustice @WeCliCLnd, Dancer @breathinMvmt, #Trauma educator @ASPassage","id_on_source":"DrJodiHall","tweeter_id":"1696969196","geo":{"lt":42.98339,"ln":-81.23304,"country":"CA"},"followers":639},"tweet_id":"696694033012301825"}]}}
