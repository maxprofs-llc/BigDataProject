The optimal conditions for binding have been determined. The water-insoluble PBGase retained a high percentage of the activity of the soluble enzyme; the coupling yield was also high. Sepharose-PBGase could be stored at 4 C for periods up to 5 weeks with 40% loss of activity; however, both by storage and repeated use, isomerase was inactivated and the percentage of uroporphyrinogen I formed was increased. Attachment of PBGase to Sepharose has led to enhanced thermal stability. pH optima of the insolubilized enzyme was shifted 0.6 units towards the alkaline side as compared to that of the native enzyme.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9213cf058f61000d841","authors":["Rossetti, M V","Parera, V E","del C Batlle, A M"],"first_seen_on":"2016-02-07T10:16:35+00:00","issns":["0001-6764"],"issue":"5","journal":"Acta physiologica latino americana","last_mentioned_on":1454825274,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28632","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28632\/"],"pmid":"28632","pubdate":"1976-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Porphyrin biosynthesis.
