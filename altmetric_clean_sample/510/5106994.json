As the most commonly used estrogen screening assays are either yeast- or human-cell based systems, the question of their (eco)toxicological relevance when assessing risks for aquatic species can be raised. The present study addresses the use of zebrafish (zf) derived reporter gene assays, both in vitro (i.e. zf liver cell lines stably expressing zfER\u03b1, zfER\u03b21 and zfER\u03b22 subtypes) and in vivo (i.e. transgenic cyp19a1b-GFP zf embryos), to assess estrogenic contaminants in river waters. By investigating 20 French river sites using passive sampling, high frequencies of in vitro zfER-mediated activities in water extracts were measured. Among the different in vitro assays, zfER\u03b22 assay was the most sensitive and responsive one, enabling the detection of active compounds at all investigated sites. In addition, comparison with a conventional human-based in vitro assay highlighted sites that were able to active zfERs but not human ER, suggesting the occurrence of zf-specific ER ligands. Furthermore, a significant in vivo estrogenic activity was detected at the most active sites in vitro, with a good accordance between estradiol equivalent (E2-EQ) concentrations derived from both in vitro and in vivo assays. Overall, this study shows the relevance and usefulness of such novel zebrafish-based assays as screening tools to monitor estrogenic activities in complex mixtures such as water extracts. It also supports their preferred use compared to human-based assays to assess the potential risks caused by endocrine disruptive chemicals for aquatic species such as fish.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034e7","authors":["Sonavane, Manoj","Creusot, Nicolas","Maillot-Mar\u00e9chal, Emmanuelle","P\u00e9ry, Alexandre","Brion, Fran\u00e7ois","A\u0457t-A\u00efssa, Selim","Manoj Sonavane","Nicolas Creusot","Emmanuelle Maillot-Mar\u00e9chal","Alexandre P\u00e9ry","Fran\u00e7ois Brion","Selim A\u0457t-A\u00efssa"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2016.01.187","first_seen_on":"2016-02-08T12:49:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1026","00489697"],"journal":"Science of the Total Environment","last_mentioned_on":1454935746,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26851879?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2016.01.187"],"pmid":"26851879","pubdate":"2016-02-08T22:00:22+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Zebrafish-based reporter gene assays reveal different estrogenic activities in river waters compared to a conventional human-derived assay.","type":"article","volume":"550","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zebrafishbased-reporter-gene-assays-reveal-different-estrogenic-activities-river-waters-compared-con"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200675,"mean":6.9381491960233,"rank":7096685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200675,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":333887,"mean":9.7817651054548,"rank":281420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":333887,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5250,"mean":5.0486976566965,"rank":4609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5250,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232,"mean":6.6956623376623,"rank":200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
