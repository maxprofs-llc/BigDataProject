The information on reproductive history, body size, alcohol use, and physical activity was obtained by means of a self-administered questionnaire. There was a significant trend in increasing E2 level with increasing height after taking account of age and body mass index (BMI) (p for trend = 0.04). BMI was inversely associated with SHBG level after controlling age (p for trend = 0.01). Decreasing progesterone with increasing BMI was observed after controlling age and history of hysterectomy (P = 0.05). Alcohol consumption was positively associated with E2 level and there was a strong linear trend after controlling for age, height, and BMI (p for trend = 0.001). Trend for increasing DHEAS with alcohol consumption was also statistically significant after controlling for age and history of hysterectomy (p for trend = 0.01). Reproductive factors as well as physical activity were not related to any of the hormone levels.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006cf8","authors":["Nagata, C","Kabuto, M","Takatsuka, N","Shimizu, H"],"first_seen_on":"2016-02-07T09:37:54+00:00","issns":["0167-6806"],"issue":"3","journal":"Breast Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1454830630,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9266103?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"9266103","pubdate":"1997-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Associations of alcohol, height, and reproductive factors with serum hormone concentrations in postmenopausal Japanese women.
