Here we discuss two potential uses of anthropogenic noise. First, local variations in the ambient-noise field could be used to perceive objects and navigate within an environment. Second, introduced sound cues could be used as a signal for prey detection or orientation and navigation. Although the disadvantages of noise pollution will likely outweigh any positive effects, it is important to acknowledge that such changes may benefit some species.","aggregated_in":[5300839],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd24","authors":["Amanda Stansbury","Volker Deecke","Thomas G\u00f6tz","Vincent M.
