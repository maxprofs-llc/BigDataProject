Both improve neck and trunk!"],"citation":{"abstract":"This 9-month randomised controlled workplace physical activity trial investigated the effects of soccer and Zumba exercise, respectively, on muscle strength, maximal jump height, sit-and-reach flexibility and postural sway among female workers. A total of 107 female hospital employees aged 25-63 were cluster-randomised to a soccer group, a Zumba group or a control group. Training was conducted outside working hours as two to three 1-h weekly sessions the first 3\u00a0months and once a week the last 6\u00a0months. Tests were conducted at baseline, after 3 and 9\u00a0months. The soccer group improved maximal neck extension strength both after 3 (1.2\u00a0kg; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and 9\u00a0months (1.7\u00a0kg; P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) compared to the control group. The Zumba group improved maximal trunk extension strength (3.1\u00a0kg; P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) after 3\u00a0months, with improvements in postural sway velocity moment (-9.2\u00a0mm(2)\/s; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and lower limb lean mass (0.4\u00a0kg; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) after 9\u00a0months. No significant intervention effects were revealed in vertical jump height or sit-and-reach flexibility. The present study indicates that workplace-initiated soccer and Zumba exercise may be beneficial for improvement of the neck and trunk strength, which may have preventive effects with regard to future perceived muscle pain in the respective body regions. Furthermore, the Zumba group revealed positive effects on lower limb lean mass and postural sway compared to the control group.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f61000150d","authors":["Svein Barene","Barene, Svein","Holtermann, Andreas","Oseland, Harald","Brekke, Ole-Lars","Krustrup, Peter"],"doi":"10.1080\/02640414.2016.1140906","endpage":"10","first_seen_on":"2016-02-06T11:32:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0264-0414","1466-447X"],"journal":"Journal of Sports Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1456314093,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/02640414.2016.1140906","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/02640414.2016.1140906?journalCode=rjsp20&","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26849477\/","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/02640414.2016.1140906?journalCode=rjsp20#\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/02640414.2016.1140906?journalCode=rjsp20"],"pmid":"26849477","pubdate":"2016-02-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Effects on muscle strength, maximal jump height, flexibility and postural sway after soccer and Zumba exercise among female hospital employees: a 9-month randomised controlled trial","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-muscle-strength-maximal-jump-height-flexibility-postural-sway-after-soccer-zumba-exercise-am"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7269211,"mean":6.3660833867746,"rank":1477665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5743648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7269211,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320725,"mean":9.5204154537855,"rank":81870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":237934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320725,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2032,"mean":12.168078778927,"rank":1132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":885,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2032,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":16.448353982301,"rank":97,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
