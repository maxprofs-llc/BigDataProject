However, patient characteristics may have an influence on the ability to comprehend and assimilate the information given. We investigated differences in patients born in Sweden and those born outside Sweden regarding how they perceived the information given before THR, and if this was associated with different patient-reported outcomes one year after surgery. Patients and methods - From Sahlgrenska University Hospital, we recruited 150 patients born in Sweden and 50 patients born outside Sweden who were to undergo THR. We retrieved routinely collected data from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register including basic demographic variables and patient-reported outcome measures, both preoperatively and at 1-year follow-up. In a separate survey carried out 1-2 weeks after surgery, patients were asked about the information provided in connection with the operation. Results - Patients born outside Sweden more frequently reported that they were poorly informed about possibilities to treat pain and about the operation itself. 1 year after the operation, patients born outside Sweden who, 1-2 weeks after the operation, had reported that they were poorly informed also reported having worse outcomes. Poorer results were found for the questions self-care and anxiety\/depression in the EQ-5D questionnaire, pain on a visual analog scale (VAS), EQVAS, and EQ-5D index compared to those patients born in Sweden who had received at least some information of acceptable quality. Interpretation - One quarter of the patients were not satisfied with the information provided before and after THR. These patients more commonly reported perioperative anxiety and they were more often born outside Sweden. Poorly informed patients who had come from countries outside Sweden were more likely to report inferior outcome 1 year after the operation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5173cf058f610003802","authors":["Krupic, Ferid","Rolfson, Ola","Nemes, Szilard","K\u00e4rrholm, Johan"],"doi":"10.3109\/17453674.2015.1135664","first_seen_on":"2016-02-07T11:29:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1745-3682"],"journal":"Acta Orthopaedica","last_mentioned_on":1457364310,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26848766?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26848766"],"pmid":"26848766","pubdate":"2016-02-07T22:01:28+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Poor patient-reported outcome after hip replacement, related to poor perception of perioperative information, commoner in immigrants than in non-immigrants.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/poor-patientreported-outcome-after-hip-replacement-related-poor-perception-perioperative-information"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7361309,"mean":6.3962513384811,"rank":5308593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1795209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7361309,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":321678,"mean":9.5530282426157,"rank":205168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":98045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":321678,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":353,"mean":3.4566988636364,"rank":238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":353,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.425,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
