The data were collected to provide information for state and regional service providers, managed care companies, and policy makers to identify demographic gaps in care and inform policy and educational efforts to improve care.\nWe obtained records on emergency department visits and hospitalizations through patient-based uniform billing data. We stratified analyses of acute care utilization and 30-day readmission rates by patient age, region, and expected payer.\nYoung adults, those with public insurance, and those who resided in a region with the largest number of patients had the highest rates of acute care utilization and 30-day readmissions. Patients who resided in a largely rural area without access to comprehensive care also had high rates of acute care utilization and readmissions. The pattern of readmissions data suggested that data on 7- or 14-day readmission rates, in addition to data on 30-day readmission rates, could be used as benchmarks of quality of care for adult patients with SCD.\nAdministrative datasets can provide important information on demographic gaps in care for patients with SCD. The results highlight both national and regional issues in the provision of health-care services for patients with SCD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8033cf058f61000b970","authors":["Schlenz, Alyssa M","Boan, Andrea D","Lackland, Daniel T","Adams, Robert J","Kanter, Julie"],"first_seen_on":"2016-02-06T12:49:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1468-2877"],"issue":"1","journal":"Public Health Reports (1896-1970)","last_mentioned_on":1454762960,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26843676?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC4716478","pmid":"26843676","pubdate":"2016-02-06T22:02:12+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Policy And Administration","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Needs Assessment for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease in South Carolina, 2012.","type":"article","volume":"131","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/needs-assessment-patients-sickle-cell-disease-south-carolina-2012-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7108255,"mean":6.3028542255213,"rank":6117045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7108255,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319312,"mean":9.4637329875886,"rank":264249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319312,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":770,"mean":6.8283719115735,"rank":709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":770,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":3.40625,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ConcordeMedica\/statuses\/695952414910898176","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5102264],"posted_on":"2016-02-06T12:49:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Alex Concorde","url":"http:\/\/www.dralexconcorde.info\/#!health-and-medicine\/c224f","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1248165228\/concorde_medica_cropped__normal.jpg","description":"Dr Alex is creator of a unique 21C Individual Medicine called 'CruX'!
