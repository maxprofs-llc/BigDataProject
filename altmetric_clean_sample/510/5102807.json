These infections may influence each other in evolution and outcome, including cancer or immunodeficiency. Many studies have reported the influence of genetic markers on the host immune response against different persistent viral infections, such as HTLV-1 infection, pointing to the importance of the individual genetic background on their outcomes. However, despite recent advances on the knowledge of the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 infection, gaps in the understanding of the role of the individual genetic background on the progress to disease clinically manifested still remain. In this scenario, much less is known regarding the influence of genetic factors in the context of dual or triple infections or their influence on the underlying mechanisms that lead to outcomes that differ from those observed in monoinfection. This review describes the main factors involved in the virus-host balance, especially for some particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes, and other important genetic markers in the development of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy\/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM\/TSP) and other persistent viruses, such as HIV and HCV.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53b3cf058f610004704","authors":["Assone, Tatiane","Paiva, Arthur","Fonseca, Luiz Augusto M","Casseb, Jorge","Tatiane Assone","Arthur Paiva","Luiz Augusto M.
