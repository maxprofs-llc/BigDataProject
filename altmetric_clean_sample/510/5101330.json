We describe a new approach to capture, concentrate and prepare amplification-ready DNA from antibiotic resistant bacteria in human urine samples. Klebsiella pneumoniae NCTC13443 (bla CTX-M-15 positive) spiked into filtered human urine was used as a model system. Bacteria were captured using anion exchange diaethylaminoethyl (DEAE) magnetic microparticles and concentrated 200-fold within ~3.5\u00a0min using a custom, valve-less microfluidic chip. Eight samples were processed in parallel, and DNA was released using heat lysis from an integrated resistive heater. The crude cell lysate was used for real time Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) of the bla CTX-M-15 gene. The end to end processing time was approximately 15\u00a0min with a limit of detection of 1000 bacteria in 1\u00a0mL urine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c7a","authors":["Valiadi, Martha","Kalsi, Sumit","Jones, Isaac G F","Turner, Carrie","Sutton, J Mark","Morgan, Hywel"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10544-016-0031-9","first_seen_on":"2016-02-06T11:04:46+00:00","funders":["niehs","dohuk"],"issns":["1572-8781","1387-2176"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biomedical Microdevices","last_mentioned_on":1458035264,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26846875?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26846875"],"pmid":"26846875","pubdate":"2016-02-06T22:01:07+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biophysics and Biological Physics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Engineering Fluid Dynamics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Simple and rapid sample preparation system for the molecular detection of antibiotic resistant pathogens in human urine.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simple-rapid-sample-preparation-system-molecular-detection-antibiotic-resistant-pathogens-human-urin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7396084,"mean":6.428716941112,"rank":3063562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4225695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7396084,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":322458,"mean":9.5424147095578,"rank":122587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":193669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":322458,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156,"mean":2.0691483870968,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.82916666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
