Pathologic study of several arteries of muscular and elastic type revealed a mediolytic arteriopathy with widespread mucoid degeneration and cystic transformation of the vessel wall caused by segmental degeneration of smooth muscle cells of the tunica media. We hypothesize that mediolytic arteriopathy was a predisposing factor for the dissection of the internal carotid artery after chiropractic manipulations in our patient.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b59","authors":["Peters, M","Bohl, J","Th\u00f6mke, F","Kallen, K J","Mahlzahn, K","Wandel, E","Meyer zum B\u00fcschenfelde, K H"],"first_seen_on":"2016-02-08T14:52:30+00:00","issns":["0028-3878"],"issue":"12","journal":"Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1454977800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8848211","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8848211"],"pmid":"8848211","pubdate":"1995-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Dissection of the internal carotid artery after chiropractic manipulation of the neck.","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dissection-internal-carotid-artery-after-chiropractic-manipulation-neck"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.048,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.048},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8036191,"mean":6.8192510254206,"rank":570400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7465903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8036191,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":332323,"mean":9.7367814950559,"rank":32022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":300301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":332323,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9575,"mean":13.485772508878,"rank":1513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":8062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9575,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279,"mean":20.372402877698,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":179,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
