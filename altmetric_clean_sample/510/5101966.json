Objective and unbiased validation studies over a significant number of cases are required to establish a more solid picture on the reliability. However, there is lack of protocols and standards in the application of the technique leading to contradictory information concerning reliability. Instead of following a uniform methodology, every expert tends to apply his own approach to the problem, based on the available technology and deep knowledge on human craniofacial anatomy, soft tissues, and their relationships. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability of different craniofacial superimposition methodologies and the corresponding technical approaches to this type of identification. With all the data generated, some of the most representative experts in craniofacial identification joined in a discussion intended to identify and agree on the most important issues that have to be considered to properly employ the craniofacial superimposition technique. As a consequence, the consortium has produced the current manuscript, which can be considered the first standard in the field; including good and bad practices, sources of error and uncertainties, technological requirements and desirable features, and finally a common scale for the craniofacial matching evaluation. Such a document is intended to be part of a more complete framework for craniofacial superimposition, to be developed during the FP7-founded project MEPROCS, which will favour and standardize its proper application.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002900","authors":["S Damas","C Wilkinson","T Kahana","E Veselovskaya","A Abramov","R Jankauskas","P T Jayaprakash","E Ruiz","F Navarro","M I Huete","E Cunha","F Cavalli","J Clement","P Lest\u00f3n","F Molinero","T Briers","F Viegas","K Imaizumi","D Humpire","O Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez","Damas, S","Wilkinson, C","Kahana, T","Veselovskaya, E","Abramov, A","Jankauskas, R","Jayaprakash, P T","Ruiz, E","Navarro, F","Huete, M I","Cunha, E","Cavalli, F","Clement, J","Lest\u00f3n, P","Molinero, F","Briers, T","Viegas, F","Imaizumi, K","Humpire, D","Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, O","S.
