Six centers participated in the development of a standardized protocol for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. Data were gathered in an online registry. Children (n\u00a0=\u00a0379) with a documented cCMV infection and at least 2 separate audiologic evaluations were included. Audiometric results from a multicenter cohort study of children with cCMV infection with longitudinal observation were examined.\nResults from 123 children with a symptomatic and 256 children with an asymptomatic cCMV infection were analyzed. In the group with symptomatic cCMV, 63% had hearing loss, compared with 8% in the group with asymptomatic cCMV. Delayed-onset hearing loss occurred in 10.6% of symptomatic cCMV and in 7.8% of asymptomatic cCMV. In the group with symptomatic cCMV, 29.3% of children used some kind of hearing amplification; 1.6% in the group with asymptomatic cCMV used hearing amplification.\nSymptomatic and asymptomatic cCMV infections are a major cause of hearing loss in childhood. Reliable estimates of the long-term outcome of cCMV infection are mandatory to increase vigilance, especially among pregnant women and to draw attention to preventive measures, vaccine development, and prenatal and postnatal therapy. Universal screening of newborns for cCMV infection should be initiated and combined with longitudinal audiometric follow-up.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a88","authors":["Julie Goderis","Annelies Keymeulen","Koenraad Smets","Helen Van Hoecke","Els De Leenheer","An Boudewyns","Christian Desloovere","Rudolf Kuhweide","Marie Muylle","Liesbeth Royackers","Isabelle Schatteman","Ingeborg Dhooge","Goderis, Julie","Keymeulen, Annelies","Smets, Koenraad","Van Hoecke, Helen","De Leenheer, Els","Boudewyns, An","Desloovere, Christian","Kuhweide, Rudolf","Muylle, Marie","Royackers, Liesbeth","Schatteman, Isabelle","Dhooge, Ingeborg"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jpeds.2016.01.024","endpage":"115.e2","first_seen_on":"2016-02-08T22:14:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"1854\/LU-7279407","handles":["1854\/LU-7279407"],"issns":["0022-3476","1097-6833","00223476"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1455681267,"links":["http:\/\/www.jpeds.com\/article\/S0022-3476(16)00026-3\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26858192","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jpeds.2016.01.024","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jpeds.2016.01.024"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jpeds.com\/article\/S0022347616000263\/pdf","pmid":"26858192","pubdate":"2016-02-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"110","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Hearing in Children with Congenital Cytomegalovirus Infection: Results of a Longitudinal Study","type":"article","volume":"172","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hearing-children-congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-results-longitudinal-study-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8077874,"mean":6.8578111393843,"rank":1845062,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6217438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8077874,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":332509,"mean":9.7598299409331,"rank":90078,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":241499,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":332509,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5753,"mean":8.1851968011127,"rank":1512,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":4229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5753,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203,"mean":11.646108910891,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
