This is of increasing significance as demographic studies are warning of an aging population in North America and worldwide. Various smart homes and systems have been developed to detect cognitive decline through continuous monitoring of high risk individuals. However, the majority of these smart homes and systems use a number of predefined heuristics to detect changes in cognition, which has been demonstrated to focus on the idiosyncratic nuances of the individual subjects and thus does not generalize. In this paper, we address this problem by building generalized linear models of home activity of older adults monitored using unobtrusive sensing technologies. We use inhomogenous Poisson processes to model the presence of the recruited older adults within different rooms throughout the day. We employ an information theoretic approach to compare the generalized linear models learned, and we observe significant statistical differences between the cognitively intact and impaired older adults. Using a simple thresholding approach, we were able to detect mild cognitive impairment in older adults with an average area under the ROC curve of 0.716 and an average area under the precision-recall curve of 0.706 using activity models estimated over a time window of 12 weeks.","authors":["Akl, Ahmad","Snoek, Jasper","Mihailidis, Alex"],"doi":"10.1109\/jbhi.2015.2512273","first_seen_on":"2016-02-06T12:17:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2168-2208"],"journal":"IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics","last_mentioned_on":1454735944,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26841424"],"pmid":"26841424","pubdate":"2016-02-06T22:02:55+00:00","title":"Unobtrusive Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults Through Home Monitoring.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unobtrusive-detection-mild-cognitive-impairment-older-adults-through-home-monitoring-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Unobtrusive Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults Through Home Monitoring.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=25368405609&p=1pl&v=1&x=Ci9yc3Ot_6A4zzFK8CJEuA","license":"public","citation_ids":[5102108],"posted_on":"2016-02-06T05:19:04+00:00","summary":".
