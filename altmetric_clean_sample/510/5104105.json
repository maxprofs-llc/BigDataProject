Subsequent treatment with trypsin (0.1 microgram\/ml) released 125I into the supernatant and yielded cells coated with a 33,000-dalton fragment of alpha-chain, presumably C3d. These results are in agreement with those obtained by others using fluid phase C3b. C3b-coated cells (EAC1423b) adhered to complement (C) receptors on human erythrocytes, glomeruli, and monocytes. C3bi-coated cells adhered to the receptors on glomeruli and monocytes, but not to those on human erythrocytes. C3d-coated cells adhered only to the monocyte receptors. The findings suggest that the glomerular C receptor recognizes portions of the C3 molecule different from those recognized by either the erythrocyte or monocyte receptors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Carlo, J R","Ruddy, S","Studer, E J","Conrad, D H"],"first_seen_on":"2016-02-07T08:53:55+00:00","issns":["0022-1767"],"issue":"2","journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1454835188,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/88474"],"pmid":"88474","pubdate":"1979-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Complement receptor binding of C3b-coated cells treated with C3b inactivator, beta 1H globulin and trypsin.","type":"article","volume":"123","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complement-receptor-binding-c3bcoated-cells-treated-c3b-inactivator-beta-1h-globulin-trypsin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7128274,"mean":6.3030470395816,"rank":6136308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7128274,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319286,"mean":9.4899270244449,"rank":264352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319286,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6857,"mean":2.5828628938156,"rank":5657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6857,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299,"mean":2.8162416107383,"rank":271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
