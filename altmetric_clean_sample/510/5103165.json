Cases identified by the National Poison Data System (NPDS) were reviewed for the years 1998-2003 and 2006-2013.\nA total of 300 paraquat- and 144 diquat-related acute illnesses were identified by SENSOR, PISP, and IDS. NPDS identified 693 paraquat- and 2128 diquat-related acute illnesses. In SENSOR\/PISP\/IDS, illnesses were commonly low severity (paraquat=41%; diquat=81%); however, SENSOR\/PISP\/IDS identified 24 deaths caused by paraquat and 5 deaths associated with diquat. Nineteen paraquat-related deaths were due to ingestion, seven of which were unintentional, often due to improper storage in beverage bottles. In SENSOR\/PISP\/IDS, paraquat and diquat-related acute illnesses were work-related in 68% (n=203) and 29% (n=42) of cases, respectively. When herbicide application site was known, the vast majority of acute paraquat-related illnesses (81%) arose from agricultural applications. Common root causes of illness were failure to use adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), application equipment failure, and spill\/splash of herbicide.\nAlthough the magnitude of acute paraquat\/diquat-related illnesses was relatively low, several fatalities were identified. Many illnesses could be prevented through stricter compliance with label requirements (e.g. ensuring proper herbicide storage and PPE use), and through enhanced training of certified applicators.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ee","authors":["Fortenberry, Gamola Z","Beckman, John","Schwartz, Abby","Prado, Joanne Bonnar","Graham, Lucia S","Higgins, Sheila","Lackovic, Michelle","Mulay, Prakash","Bojes, Heidi","Waltz, Justin","Mitchell, Yvette","Leinenkugel, Kathy","Oriel, Michel S","Evans, Elizabeth","Calvert, Geoffrey M","Gamola Z.
