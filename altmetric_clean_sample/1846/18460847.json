We used a 10-mm-diameter and 200-mm-long hydrocoil. The distance between the 2 inflated balloons was set at 5\u00a0mm in the perfused tube, and each procedure was performed twice. The longitudinal lengths of the deployed coil mass and volume embolization rates (VERs) at the embolization site obtained using the 3 techniques were compared statistically.\nThe longitudinal lengths of the deployed coil mass were 26\u00a0mm (range, 21-34\u00a0mm), 10\u00a0mm (8-14\u00a0mm), and 5\u00a0mm (5-5\u00a0mm) in proximal BT, distal BT, and DBT, respectively. The median VERs were 15.9% (12.2-19.4%), 41.4% (29.6-51.8%), and 82.9% (82.9-82.9%), respectively. Significant differences in the lengths and VERs were observed among the 3 techniques (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nDBT achieved the tight packing of a hydrocoil in a short segment of an experimental vascular model compared with proximal BT and distal BT, suggesting DBT as the optimal embolization technique in this model.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006de9","authors":["Daisuke Yunaiyama","Toru Saguchi","Tomohisa Moriya","Natsuhiko Shirota","Jun Otaka","Koichi Tokuuye","Yuichi Nagakawa","Akihiko Tsuchida","Kazuhiro Saito"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00270-017-1589-1","first_seen_on":"2017-04-03T16:24:31+00:00","issns":["0174-1551","1432-086X"],"journal":"CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1491574500,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00270-017-1589-1?platform=hootsuite","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00270-017-1589-1"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00270-017-1589-1.pdf","pmid":"28180927","pubdate":"2017-02-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nuclear Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ultrasound","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology","cardiology"],"title":"Short-Segment Coil Embolization Using a Double-Balloon Technique in an Experimental Vascular Model","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shortsegment-coil-embolization-using-doubleballoon-technique-experimental-vascular-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.5,"score_history":{"1y":5.5,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8463421,"mean":7.1088797377338,"rank":1550131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6906117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8463421,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250563,"mean":13.135768153191,"rank":63909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":186478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250563,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":602,"mean":2.4239767054908,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":558,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":602,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":2.9090322580645,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"ES":1,"CY":1,"GB":1,"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CVIR_Journal\/statuses\/848934122324197376","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18460847],"posted_on":"2017-04-03T16:24:01+00:00","author":{"name":"CVIR Journal","url":"http:\/\/www.cvironline.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/893470600160739328\/GeL2OkhP_normal.jpg","description":"CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology is a peer-reviewed medical journal.
