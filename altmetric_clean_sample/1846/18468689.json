Two models of individualized study matching were compared for effectiveness in enrolling people who \"endorsed current drug use\" and those who \"did not\" into appropriate research.\nParticipants in the NIDA-funded Transformative Approach to Reduce Research Disparities Towards Drug Users study (Navigation Study) were recruited through a Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) community engagement model. Of the 614 community-recruited adults, 326 endorsed current drug use (cases); 288 did not (controls). Participants were randomized to one of two intervention groups: Navigation as Usual (NAU) [individualized study matching through a Study Navigator] or Enhanced Navigation (N+) [individualized study matching plus transportation and other assistance through an Ambassador]. Rates of enrollment into research studies were compared.\nAt 90 days, N+ vs. the NAU intervention was associated with higher enrollment among both drug users (36.0% N+ vs. 24.9% NAU) and non-drug users (45.5% N+ vs. 25.2% NAU). NAU attained the same rate of enrollment for users of drugs (24.9%) and non-users (25.2%); N+ had similar rates as well (36.0% drug users vs. 45.5% non-drug users). In addition, high rates of enrollment were achieved among all groups of participants, from 24.9% (drug users in NAU) to 45.5% (non-drug users in N+).\nBoth the NAU and N+ methods can reduce barriers and help users and non-users become part of the population that participates in research. Working with the local CTSA adds significant value to the research enterprise.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002732","authors":["Linda B. Cottler","Catherine W. Striley","Amy L.
