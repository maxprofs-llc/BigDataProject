After removing the urethral catheters on post-operation day six, we instructed a group of 30 patients to double void their bladders within five minutes after the first micturition. The rest of the patients served as controls. Urine cultures were repeated frequently before and at the time of removal of urethral catheters and double J stents to detect the incidence of urinary tract infection in both groups. All recipients received cotrimoxazol prophylactically. The group of patients who performed the double voiding technique had significantly lower incidence of positive urine cultures than the control group at the time of removing the double J stents (1 (3.3%) vs. 12 (34.2%) respectively). We conclude that double voiding may reduce risk of urine infection in patients with double J stents in renal allograft ureters.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa70d3cf058f61000a74d","authors":["Zomorrodi, Afshar","Bohluli, Abulfasel"],"first_seen_on":"2017-04-03T19:04:36+00:00","issns":["1319-2442"],"issue":"4","journal":"Saudi Journal of Kidney Diseases and Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1491217200,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17951938"],"pmid":"17951938","pubdate":"2007-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Double urinary bladder voiding technique post removal of urethral catheter in renal allograft recipients.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/double-urinary-bladder-voiding-technique-post-removal-urethral-catheter-renal-allograft-recipients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":1242564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":7135111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250410,"mean":13.130435910849,"rank":54699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":193050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250410,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235,"mean":1.1257606837607,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.65625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
