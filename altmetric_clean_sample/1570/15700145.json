Nano-scale size and a possibility for diverse surface modifications allow carbon nanoallotropes to become an indispensable nanostructured material in nanotechnologies, including nanomedicine. Manipulation of surface chemistry has created diverse populations of water-soluble derivatives of fullerenes, which exhibit different behaviors. Both non-derivatized and derivatized fullerenes show various biological activities. Cellular processes that underline their toxicity are oxidative, genotoxic, and cytotoxic responses.The antioxidant\/cytoprotective properties of fullerenes and derivatives have been considered in the prevention of organ oxidative damage and treatment. The same unique physiochemical properties of nanomaterials may also be associated with potential health hazards. Non-biodegradability and toxicity of carbon nanoparticles still remain a great concern in the area of biomedical application. In this review, we report on basic physical and chemical properties of carbon nano-clusters--fullerenes, nanotubes, and grapheme--their specificities, activities, and potential application in biological systems. Special emphasis is given to our most important results obtained in vitro and in vivo using polyhydroxylated fullerene derivative C\u2086\u2080(OH)\u2082\u2084.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f61000186c","authors":["Bogdanovi\u0107, Gordana","Djordjevi\u0107, Aleksandar"],"first_seen_on":"2017-01-23T13:48:01+00:00","issns":["0370-8179"],"issue":"3-4","journal":"Serbian Archives for the Whole Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1485179226,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27483572"],"pmid":"27483572","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Carbon nanomaterials: Biologically active fullerene derivatives.","type":"article","volume":"144"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8277902,"mean":6.9833214656645,"rank":7158489,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8277902,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273225,"mean":12.584366409978,"rank":225019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273225,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":1.3922307692308,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":3,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dreamgbutterfly\/statuses\/823527479167987713","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15700145],"posted_on":"2017-01-23T13:47:06+00:00","author":{"name":"BreakTime","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/898281710554537985\/ydYwyJ3z_normal.jpg","description":"Cannabis, Oil, Utilities, Energy, Agriculture & Health, 2nd Amdt.
