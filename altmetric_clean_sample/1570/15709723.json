The coils are made of soft copper windings in multiple planes that lie adjacent to the skull. They are located within a special helmet so that their magnetic fields combine and improve depth penetration. The H1 dTMS coil is designed to stimulate bilateral prefrontal cortices with greater effective stimulation over the left than the right. By positioning the left side of the coil close to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the H1 coil was used in a multisite study, leading to FDA approval for treatment-resistant depression. In this same position, the H1 coil was also explored as a possible treatment for negative symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar depression, and migraine. When moved to different positions over the subject's skull, the H1 coil was also explored as a possible treatment for other conditions. Such manipulation of the H1 coil was demonstrated for PTSD and alcohol dependence by positioning it over the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), for anxiety by positioning it over the right prefrontal cortex (rPFC), for auditory hallucinations and tinnitus by positioning it over the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and for Parkinson's and fatigue from multiple sclerosis (MS) by positioning it over the motor cortex (MC) and PFC. Corresponding electrical field diagrams measured with an oscilloscope through a saline-filled head are included.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f23","authors":["Aron Tendler","Yiftach Roth","Noam Barnea-Ygael","Abraham Zangen"],"doi":"10.3791\/55100","first_seen_on":"2017-01-23T20:16:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-087X"],"issue":"119","journal":"Journal of Visualized Experiments","last_mentioned_on":1506680715,"links":["http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/55100\/how-to-use-h1-deep-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-coil-for","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28190035?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jove.com\/pdf\/55100\/how-to-use-h1-deep-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-coil-for","pmid":"28190035","pubdate":"2017-01-23T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","biology"],"title":"How to Use the H1 Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Coil for Conditions Other than Depression","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/h1-deep-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-coil-conditions-other-depression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0.25,"6d":0.25,"5d":0.25,"4d":0.25,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":3988478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4439799,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283651,"mean":12.479603567777,"rank":134301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":147423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283651,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4320,"mean":3.275785135448,"rank":1522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4320,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134,"mean":7.5655639097744,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
