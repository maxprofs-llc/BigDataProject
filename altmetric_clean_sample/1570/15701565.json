The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and identify correlates of hypertension among residents aged 20-59 years of a slum-resettlement colony.\nA community-based cross-sectional study was done from 2010 to 2012 in NandNagri, a slum-resettlement area in east Delhi. 310 participants aged 20-59 years were enrolled through multistage systematic random sampling. Each study subject was interviewed and examined for raised blood pressure; data on risk factors including smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity and salt consumption were also collected. Data were analysed by use of univariate and multivariate regression.\nThe overall prevalence of hypertension was 17.4% and 35% participants were prehypertensive. On multiple logistic regression, age 40-49 years (P = 0.020) and 50-59 years (P = 0.012), clerical\/professional occupation (P = 0.004), abnormal waist circumference (\u226590 cm in males and \u2265 80 cm in females; P = 0.001), positive family history of hypertension in both parents (P = 0.013) and above-average daily salt intake (P = 0.000) were significantly associated with hypertension.\nThese findings indicate that hypertension is a significant health problem in the study population. Many study participants diagnosed with prehypertension are at risk of developing hypertension, thus immediate public-health interventions are indicated.","authors":["Panesar","Sanjeet Panesar","Sanjay Chaturvedi","NK Saini","Rajnish Avasthi","Abhishek Singh"],"doi":"10.4103\/2224-3151.122937","first_seen_on":"2017-01-23T14:45:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["2224-3151","2304-5272"],"issue":"2","journal":"WHO South-East Asia Journal of Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1356998400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4103\/2224-3151.122937"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.who-seajph.org\/article.asp?issn=2224-3151;year=2013;volume=2;issue=2;spage=83;epage=87;aulast=Panesar;type=2","pmid":"28612764","pubdate":"2013-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","startpage":"83","title":"Prevalence and predictors of hypertension among residents aged 20-59 years of a slum-resettlement colony in Delhi, India","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.who-seajph.org\/text.asp?2013\/2\/2\/83\/122937","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-predictors-hypertension-among-residents-aged-2059-years-slumresettlement-colony-delhi-ind"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"WHO South-East Asia Journal of Public Health, Volume 2, Issue 2, April-June 2013","url":"http:\/\/apps.who.int\/iris\/bitstream\/10665\/206126\/1\/B5038.pdf","license":"public","citation_ids":[15701562,15701564,15701565,15701567,15701570,15701571,15701575,6736391,15701582,15701583,20575807,20575814,1208436,649532,20575840,20575842,20575844,20575847,20575850,15835020,20575852,20575855,14991257,20575857,20575859,203424,119662,20575863,20575864],"posted_on":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","source":{"name":"World Health Organization","description":"The World Health Organization (WHO) is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system.","geo":{"country":"CH"}},"page_url":"http:\/\/apps.who.int\/iris\/handle\/10665\/206126","collections":[],"author":{"image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/cache.altmetric.com\/policy\/thumbnails\/thumbnail-8c4b4fb20d1f7e402570c66fca7006fad1675603ed0783076d606639c7be5b0f.jpg"}}]}}
