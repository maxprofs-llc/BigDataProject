The mean age of patients at the final visit was 29.72\u2009\u00b1\u200911.27\u00a0years. The number of eyes with visual acuity of \u226420\/50 and \u226420\/200 at the final visit was 37 (28\u00a0%) and 20 (15\u00a0%), respectively; at least one ocular complication was present in 72\u00a0% of eyes. Band keratopathy was the most frequent complication (42\u00a0%), followed by cataract (25\u00a0%), posterior synechiae (22\u00a0%), maculopathy (22\u00a0%), ocular hypertension (13\u00a0%), and hypotony (5\u00a0%). At the final visit, patients who were >16\u00a0years of age at presentation to the Massachusetts Eye Research and Surgery Institution had more ocular complications and a greater degree of vision loss than patients who were \u226416\u00a0years of age. Ongoing inflammation at the final visit was noted in 40 patients (52\u00a0%). The presence of posterior synechiae, hypotony, cataract at presentation, and a history of cataract surgery prior to presentation were predictive of ongoing inflammation in adulthood in univariate analysis. The presence of hypotony and posterior synechiae at the initial visit were predictive factors in multivariate analysis.\nJIA-associated uveitis may be associated with ongoing inflammation, ocular complications, and severe visual impairment in adulthood. The presence of posterior synechiae and hypotony at the initial visit is predictive of ongoing inflammation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002982","authors":["Merih Oray","Naira Khachatryan","Nazanin Ebrahimiadib","Khawla Abu Samra","Stacey Lee","C.
