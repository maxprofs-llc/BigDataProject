To assess the therapeutic benefit of new drugs more rapidly, changes in kidney volume need to be determined over a short time interval. Here we measured renal volume changes by manual segmentation volumetry applied to magnetic resonance imaging scans obtained with an optimized T1-weighted acquisition protocol without gadolinium-based contrast agents. One hundred young patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and preserved renal function had a significant increase in total kidney volume by 2.71+\/-4.82% in 6 months. Volume measurements were highly reproducible and accurate, as indicated by correlation coefficients of 1.000 for intra-observer and 0.996 for inter-observer agreement, with acceptable within-subject standard deviations. The change in renal volume correlated with baseline total kidney volume in all age subgroups. Total kidney volume positively correlated with male gender, hypertension, albuminuria and a history of macrohematuria but negatively with creatinine clearance. Albuminuria was associated with accelerated volume progression. Our study shows that increases in kidney volume can be reliably measured over a 6 month period in early autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease using unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging sequences.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fb9","authors":["Kistler, Andreas D","Poster, Diane","Krauer, Fabienne","Weishaupt, Dominik","Raina, Shagun","Senn, Oliver","Binet, Isabelle","Spanaus, Katharina","W\u00fcthrich, Rudolf P","Serra, Andreas L"],"doi":"10.1038\/ki.2008.558","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T05:48:33+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1523-1755"],"issue":"2","journal":"Kidney International","last_mentioned_on":1235692800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18971924"],"pmid":"18971924","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Society of Nephrology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Increases in kidney volume in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease can be detected within 6 months.","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increases-kidney-volume-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-detected-within-6-months"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3620974,"mean":4.9299989306774,"rank":2016269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":927352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3620974,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231765,"mean":3.9490498438068,"rank":100627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231765,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1578,"mean":3.1711870640457,"rank":844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1578,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":2.0416,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
