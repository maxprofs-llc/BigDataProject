Hence, there is an urgent need for an anthelmintic with a new mode of action. Here we report the discovery of the amino-acetonitrile derivatives (AADs) as a new chemical class of synthetic anthelmintics and describe the development of drug candidates that are efficacious against various species of livestock-pathogenic nematodes. These drug candidates seem to have a novel mode of action involving a unique, nematode-specific clade of acetylcholine receptor subunits. The AADs are well tolerated and of low toxicity to mammals, and overcome existing resistances to the currently available anthelmintics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2008Natur.452..176K","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["Kaminsky R","Ducray P","Jung M","Clover R","Rufener L","Bouvier J","Weber SS","Wenger A","Wieland-Berghausen S","Goebel T","Gauvry N","Pautrat F","Skripsky T","Froelich O","Komoin-Oka C","Westlund B","Sluder A","M\u00e4ser P","Ronald Kaminsky","Pierre Ducray","Martin Jung","Ralph Clover","Lucien Rufener","Jacques Bouvier","Sandra Schorderet Weber","Andre Wenger","Susanne Wieland-Berghausen","Thomas Goebel","Noelle Gauvry","Fran\u00e7ois Pautrat","Thomas Skripsky","Olivier Froelich","Clarisse Komoin-Oka","Bethany Westlund","Ann Sluder","Pascal M\u00e4ser"],"doi":"10.1038\/nature06722","endpage":"180","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T05:19:27+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0028-0836","1476-4687"],"issue":"7184","journal":"Nature","last_mentioned_on":1325376000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18337814","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v452\/n7184\/full\/nature06722.html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nature06722"],"pmid":"18337814","pubdate":"2008-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"176","subjects":["science"],"title":"A new class of anthelmintics effective against drug-resistant nematodes","type":"article","volume":"452","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-class-anthelmintics-effective-against-drugresistant-nematodes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8098128,"mean":6.8916355638706,"rank":1752645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6290589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8098128,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250329,"mean":5.1007880380943,"rank":50461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":198082,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250329,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47319,"mean":73.760976583964,"rank":31444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":14849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47319,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1002,"mean":57.117772227772,"rank":749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1002,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":32,"Student  > Ph.
