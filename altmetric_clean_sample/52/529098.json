We have investigated the function of Arabidopsis thaliana NEDD1, a WD40 repeat protein related to the animal NEDD1\/GCP-WD protein, which interacts with the gamma-tubulin complex. The NEDD1 protein decorates spindle microtubules (MTs) preferentially toward spindle poles and phragmoplast MTs toward their minus ends. A T-DNA insertional allele of the single NEDD1 gene was isolated and maintained in heterozygous sporophytes, and NEDD1's function in cell division was analyzed in haploid microspores produced by the heterozygote. In approximately half of the dividing microspores exhibiting aberrant MT organization, spindles were no longer restricted to the cell periphery and became abnormally elongated. After mitosis, MTs aggregated between reforming nuclei but failed to appear in a bipolar configuration. Consequently, defective microspores did not form a continuous cell plate, and two identical nuclei were produced with no differentiation into generative and vegetative cells. Our results support the notion that the plant NEDD1 homolog plays a critical role in MT organization during mitosis, and its function is likely linked to that of the gamma-tubulin complex.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003335","authors":["Zeng CJ","Lee YR","Liu B"],"doi":"10.1105\/tpc.109.065953","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T07:45:52+00:00","issns":["1040-4651","1532-298X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Plant Cell","last_mentioned_on":1243814400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19383896","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1105\/tpc.109.065953"],"pmcid":"PMC2685624","pmid":"19383896","pubdate":"2009-04-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society of Plant Biologists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","botany"],"title":"The WD40 Repeat Protein NEDD1 Functions in Microtubule Organization during Cell Division in Arabidopsis thaliana","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wd40-repeat-protein-nedd1-functions-microtubule-organization-during-cell-division-arabidopsis-thalia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629816,"mean":4.9321920670937,"rank":2015797,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629816,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231900,"mean":3.9187798826216,"rank":100066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90634,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231900,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1915,"mean":2.5717962382445,"rank":902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1915,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163,"mean":2.6232962962963,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
