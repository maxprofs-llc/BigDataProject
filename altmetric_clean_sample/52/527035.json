Evidence for the optimal subsequent treatment is still scarce. Targeted intermittent treatment was found to be less effective than continuous treatment at preventing relapse in multiple episode patients; however, a post hoc analysis of our own data from a previous study suggested comparable efficacy of the 2 treatment approaches in first-episode patients. The current study was therefore designed to compare prospectively the relapse preventive efficacy of further maintenance treatment and targeted intermittent treatment in patients with ICD-10-diagnosed first-episode schizophrenia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bee","authors":["Gaebel, Wolfgang","Riesbeck, Mathias","W\u00f6lwer, Wolfgang","Klimke, Ansgar","Eickhoff, Matthias","von Wilmsdorff, Martina","Lemke, Matthias","Heuser, Isabella","Maier, Wolfgang","Huff, Wolfgang","Schmitt, Andrea","Sauer, Heinrich","Riedel, Michael","Klingberg, Stefan","K\u00f6pcke, Wolfgang","Ohmann, Christian","M\u00f6ller, Hans-J\u00fcrgen",", "],"doi":"10.4088\/jcp.09m05459yel","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T06:50:18+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1555-2101"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Clinical Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1299801600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20673559"],"pmid":"20673559","pubdate":"2011-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Relapse prevention in first-episode schizophrenia--maintenance vs intermittent drug treatment with prodrome-based early intervention: results of a randomized controlled trial within the German Research Network on Schizophrenia.","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relapse-prevention-firstepisode-schizophrenia-maintenance-vs-intermittent-drug-treatment-prodromebas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629283,"mean":4.9355109985986,"rank":2016286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":939032,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629283,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231895,"mean":3.923972228691,"rank":100161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231895,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1489,"mean":3.7682405913978,"rank":889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1489,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":3.695652173913,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/8962957","license":"public","citation_ids":[527035],"posted_on":"2011-03-11T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":[],"f1000_score":"2"}]}}
