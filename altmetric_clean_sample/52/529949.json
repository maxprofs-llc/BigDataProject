Overall, CD4+ T cells mediate cisplatin-induced renal injury; however, the CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cell subset (CD4+CD25+ Treg) has broad suppressive effects on many different cell types. In this study, we determined whether CD4+CD25+ Treg cells had protective effects against cisplatin-induced acute renal injury in nu\/nu mice that lack mature T cells. In these mice, there was marked attenuation of the decreased survival, renal dysfunction and tubular injury, renal tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and interleukin-1\u03b2 cytokine levels. Furthermore, renal macrophage accumulation was reduced in CD4+CD25+ Treg cell-adoptive transferred nu\/nu mice compared with control mice. Infusion of CD4+CD25+Treg cells into wild-type Balb\/c mice reduced serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels equivalent to those in nu\/nu mice and extended their survival time after cisplatin injection. In contrast, depletion of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells in wild-type mice exacerbated kidney injury after cisplatin administration. Transcription factor Foxp3-positive cells (Treg cells) were detected in the kidneys of nu\/nu mice after cisplatin injection. Our results suggest that CD4+CD25+ Treg cells directly affect cisplatin nephrotoxicity and their modulation represents an additional treatment strategy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fb9","authors":["Lee H","Nho D","Chung HS","Lee H","Shin MK","Kim SH","Bae H"],"doi":"10.1038\/ki.2010.139","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T08:07:49+00:00","issns":["0085-2538"],"issue":"11","journal":"Kidney International","last_mentioned_on":1292976000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20463654","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ki.2010.139"],"pmid":"20463654","pubdate":"2010-05-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells attenuate cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in mice.","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cd4cd25-regulatory-t-cells-attenuate-cisplatininduced-nephrotoxicity-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631865,"mean":4.925550910502,"rank":2015246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":944406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631865,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231909,"mean":3.9088416613488,"rank":99887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90995,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231909,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1582,"mean":3.1879089184061,"rank":847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1582,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.977,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
