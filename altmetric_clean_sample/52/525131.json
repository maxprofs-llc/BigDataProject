We review recent developments in the experimental understanding of cerebellar microcircuit characteristics and in the computational analysis of Marr-Albus models. We conclude that many Marr-Albus models are in effect adaptive filters, and that evidence for symmetrical long-term potentiation and long-term depression, interneuron plasticity, silent parallel fibre synapses and recurrent mossy fibre connectivity is strikingly congruent with predictions from adaptive-filter models of cerebellar function. This congruence suggests that insights from adaptive-filter theory might help to address outstanding issues of cerebellar function, including both microcircuit processing and extra-cerebellar connectivity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316e","authors":["Dean P","Porrill J","Ekerot CF","J\u00f6rntell H","Paul Dean","John Porrill","Carl-Fredrik Ekerot","Henrik J\u00f6rntell"],"doi":"10.1038\/nrn2756","endpage":"43","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T06:03:52+00:00","issns":["1471-003X","1471-0048"],"issue":"1","journal":"Nature Reviews Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1269302400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19997115","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrn\/journal\/v11\/n1\/abs\/nrn2756.html"],"pmid":"19997115","pubdate":"2009-12-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"30","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"The cerebellar microcircuit as an adaptive filter: experimental and computational evidence","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nrn2756","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cerebellar-microcircuit-adaptive-filter-experimental-computational-evidence"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.616,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.616},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3684317,"mean":4.9072834051191,"rank":477994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":3206283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3684317,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232067,"mean":3.8946059913992,"rank":28682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":203385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232067,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1279,"mean":9.8697824726135,"rank":412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1279,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":4.7151489361702,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":24,"Researcher":121,"Student  > Doctoral Student":13,"Student  > Ph.
