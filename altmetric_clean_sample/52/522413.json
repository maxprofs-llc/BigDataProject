This paper identifies and characterizes a Glycogen Synthase Kinase3 protein kinase, cloned from a cDNA library of grape Cabernet Sauvignon berries harvested at the ripening stage. This gene, called VvSK1, was mainly expressed in flowers, berries, and roots. In the berries, it was strongly expressed at postv\u00e9raison, when the berries accumulate glucose, fructose, and abscisic acid. In grapevine cell suspensions, VvSK1 transcript abundance is increased by sugars and abscisic acid. In transgenic grapevine cells overexpressing VvSK1, the expression of four monosaccharide transporters (VvHT3, VvHT4, VvHT5, and VvHT6) was up-regulated, the rate of glucose uptake was increased 3- to 5-fold, and the amount of glucose and sucrose accumulation was more than doubled, while the starch amount was not affected. This work provides, to our knowledge, the first example of the control of sugar uptake and accumulation by a sugar-inducible protein kinase.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333b","authors":["Lecourieux F","Lecourieux D","Vignault C","Delrot S"],"doi":"10.1104\/pp.109.149138","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T04:49:57+00:00","issns":["1532-2548"],"issue":"2","journal":"Plant Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1259712000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19923236","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1104\/pp.109.149138"],"pmid":"19923236","pubdate":"2010-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society of Plant Biologists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"A Sugar-Inducible Protein Kinase, VvSK1, Regulates Hexose Transport and Sugar Accumulation in Grapevine Cells","type":"article","volume":"152","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sugarinducible-protein-kinase-vvsk1-regulates-hexose-transport-sugar-accumulation-grapevine-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629910,"mean":4.9315517540573,"rank":2015749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":941029,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629910,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231900,"mean":3.9176969801511,"rank":100050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231900,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2099,"mean":2.5564642516683,"rank":1066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2099,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":1.9758217821782,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Ph.
