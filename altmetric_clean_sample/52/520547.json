Serum FGF-19 levels were measured by sandwich ELISA, and compared with other cardiovascular risk factors; lipid profile, AIP, glucose, HbA1c, and hsCRP. AIP was calculated as log (TG\/HDL-c). The median (1-3.quartile) FGF-19 levels in T2DM patients with MetS and healthy controls were 122.90 (108.63-237.60) pg\/ml and 293.45 (153.64-370.31) pg\/ml, respectively (P=0.003). Patients were also grouped by body mass index (BMI) <30 kg\/m(2) (n=13) and \u226530 kg\/m(2) (n=13) with median (1-3.quartile) FGF-19 values 168.70 (113.54-275.77) pg\/mL and 115.89 (97.94-200.40) pg\/mL, respectively (P=0.007). Significant negative correlations were found between FGF-19 and BMI, triglyceride, log (TG\/HDL-c), hsCRP, and HbA1c (r=-0.526, P=0.001; r=-0.327, P=0.05; r=-0.312, P=0.05; r=-0.435, P=0.006; r=-0.357, P=0.028, respectively). We showed that FGF-19 levels are low in T2DM patients with MetS. The negative relationship between FGF-19 and several known cardiovascular risk factors such as TG, log (TG\/HDL-c), hsCRP and HbA1c in diabetic patients with MetS suggests that FGF-19 can be used as a contributing marker.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a1a","authors":["Barutcuoglu B","Basol G","Cakir Y","Cetinkalp S","Parildar Z","Kabaroglu C","Ozmen D","Mutaf I","Bayindir O"],"first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T03:48:32+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"4","journal":"Annals of Clinical and Laboratory Science","last_mentioned_on":1324758462,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22166511?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22166511","pubdate":"2011-12-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Fibroblast growth factor-19 levels in type 2 diabetic patients with metabolic syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fibroblast-growth-factor19-levels-type-2-diabetic-patients-metabolic-syndrome-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":3094466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":969009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235117,"mean":4.2204680583204,"rank":147034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":50945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235117,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140,"mean":1.6682014388489,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.91666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
