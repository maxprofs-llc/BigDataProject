The present study was designed to further examine the efficacy of FMD normalization to shear stress in reducing measurement variability.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ef","authors":["Padilla J","Johnson BD","Newcomer SC","Wilhite DP","Mickleborough TD","Fly AD","Mather KJ","Wallace JP"],"doi":"10.1186\/1476-7120-6-44","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T05:58:49+00:00","issns":["","1476-7120"],"issue":"","journal":"Cardiovascular Ultrasound","last_mentioned_on":1231372800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18771594","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1476-7120-6-44"],"pmcid":"PMC2542351","pmid":"18771594","pubdate":"2008-09-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging","cardiology"],"title":"Normalization of flow-mediated dilation to shear stress area under the curve eliminates the impact of variable hyperemic stimulus","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/normalization-flowmediated-dilation-shear-stress-area-under-curve-eliminates-impact-variable-hyperem"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622268,"mean":4.9302137127912,"rank":2017144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":930045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622268,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231788,"mean":3.9461773783691,"rank":100580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231788,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":2.3307899159664,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.6875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
