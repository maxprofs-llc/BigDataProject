To establish 5-year outcomes for women who underwent our previously described new retropubic suspension operation (transvaginal Burch operation) for SUI at the Meram Medicine Faculty, a prospective study was performed on 231 women who had been operated on for stress incontinence and who had completed 5 years of follow up. We observed complete remission during the follow-up period in 215 women (93%). No major complication related to the procedure was reported, and results were found to be satisfactory and encouraging.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000244e","authors":["Capar M","Balci O","Acar A","Karatayli R"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1471-0528.2008.01954.x","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T04:19:10+00:00","issns":["1471-0528","14710528"],"issue":"13","journal":"British Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology","last_mentioned_on":1234224000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19035945","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1471-0528.2008.01954.x"],"pmid":"19035945","pubdate":"2008-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Transvaginal Burch operation for stress urinary incontinence: 5\u2010year results","type":"article","volume":"115","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transvaginal-burch-operation-stress-urinary-incontinence-5year-results"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629283,"mean":4.9355109985986,"rank":2016270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":939083,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629283,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231895,"mean":3.9237923879016,"rank":100157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231895,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1597,"mean":6.0716228070175,"rank":1129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1597,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122,"mean":5.2925619834711,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/1148063","license":"public","citation_ids":[521440],"posted_on":"2009-02-10T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["confirmation"],"f1000_score":"1"}]}}
