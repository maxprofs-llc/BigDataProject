Since then, many thousands such devices have worldwide been implanted in patients at high risk for conventional surgery. The procedure related mortality associated with PAVI as reported in published case series is substantial, although the intervention has never been formally compared with standard surgery. The objective of this study was to assess the safety of PAVI, and to compare it with published data reporting the risk associated with conventional aortic valve replacement in high-risk subjects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b1","authors":["Van Brabandt H","Neyt M"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2261-9-45","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T07:09:42+00:00","issns":["1471-2261"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Cardiovascular Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1264550400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19723312","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2261-9-45"],"pmid":"19723312","pubdate":"2009-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Safety of percutaneous aortic valve insertion.
