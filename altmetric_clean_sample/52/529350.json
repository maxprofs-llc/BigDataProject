Given the remarkable sensitivity of DNA-mediated charge transport (CT) to mismatched and damaged base pairs, we have proposed that DNA repair glycosylases (EndoIII and MutY) containing a redox-active [4Fe4S] cluster could use DNA CT in signaling one another to search cooperatively for damage in the genome. Here, we examine this model, where we estimate that electron transfers over a few hundred base pairs are sufficient for rapid interrogation of the full genome. Using atomic force microscopy, we found a redistribution of repair proteins onto DNA strands containing a single base mismatch, consistent with our model for CT scanning. We also demonstrated in Escherichia coli a cooperativity between EndoIII and MutY that is predicted by the CT scanning model. This relationship does not require the enzymatic activity of the glycosylase. Y82A EndoIII, a mutation that renders the protein deficient in DNA-mediated CT, however, inhibits cooperativity between MutY and EndoIII. These results illustrate how repair proteins might efficiently locate DNA lesions and point to a biological role for DNA-mediated CT within the cell.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2009PNAS..10615237B","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Boal AK","Genereux JC","Sontz PA","Gralnick JA","Newman DK","Barton JK"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.0908059106","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T07:53:09+00:00","issns":["0027-8424","1091-6490"],"issue":"36","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1257206400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19720997","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.0908059106"],"pmcid":"PMC2741234","pmid":"19720997","pubdate":"2009-09-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Redox signaling between DNA repair proteins for efficient lesion detection","type":"article","volume":"106","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/redox-signaling-between-dna-repair-proteins-efficient-lesion-detection-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636226,"mean":4.921076943263,"rank":2018527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":946058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636226,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231928,"mean":3.8956235970804,"rank":99653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231928,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33644,"mean":13.590776981839,"rank":23257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":4489,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33644,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":766,"mean":12.217840522876,"rank":484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":766,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
