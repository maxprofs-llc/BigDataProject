G. lamblia trophozoites possess several microtubular structures, namely the adhesive disc, the median body, the funis and the four pairs of flagella. Several drugs that target cytoskeletal proteins have been used in the study of cytoskeletal function and dynamics. In this work, we used oryzalin, which binds to alpha-tubulin, as a tool to study the Giardia cytoskeleton. The trophozoites were treated with oryzalin, and its effects were analysed by immunofluorescency, transmission and scanning electron microscopies. Oryzalin inhibited Giardia proliferation. Treated cells were not able to complete cell division and had flagella showing extensive shortening. Strikingly, the drug did not interfere with the adhesive disc, in contrast to what happens when other drugs are used.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003294","authors":["Terra LL","Campanati L","De Souza W"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00436-010-1831-0","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T04:57:56+00:00","issns":["0932-0113","1432-1955"],"issue":"1","journal":"Parasitology Research","last_mentioned_on":1277424000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20405146","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00436-010-1831-0"],"pmid":"20405146","pubdate":"2010-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Heterogeneity in the sensitivity of microtubules of Giardia lamblia to the herbicide oryzalin","type":"article","volume":"107","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/heterogeneity-sensitivity-microtubules-giardia-lamblia-herbicide-oryzalin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627775,"mean":4.946368885166,"rank":2017989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":933663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627775,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231888,"mean":3.9409765446103,"rank":100446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231888,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":711,"mean":1.9531633802817,"rank":315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":711,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.1991428571429,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
