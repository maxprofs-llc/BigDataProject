We previously demonstrated that phagocytosis of apoptotic hepatocytes by HSC is profibrogenic. Based on this, as well as the observation that reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH) oxidase induction is central to fibrogenesis, our aim was to study the phagocytic NADPH oxidase NOX2.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074fe","authors":["Jiang JX","Venugopal S","Serizawa N","Chen X","Scott F","Li Y","Adamson R","Devaraj S","Shah V","Gershwin ME","Friedman SL","T\u00f6r\u00f6k NJ"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.gastro.2010.05.074","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T04:59:03+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"4","journal":"Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1288742400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20685364"],"pmcid":"PMC2949521","pmid":"20685364","pubdate":"2010-08-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 plays a key role in stellate cell activation and liver fibrogenesis in vivo.","type":"article","volume":"139","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reduced-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide-phosphate-oxidase-2-plays-key-role-stellate-cell-activatio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634915,"mean":4.919334042571,"rank":2016460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634915,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231923,"mean":3.8985441657112,"rank":99671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231923,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2976,"mean":4.062291092437,"rank":1603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2976,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153,"mean":2.7789342105263,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
