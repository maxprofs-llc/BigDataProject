Here we report the effect of ATV and ATV\/ritonavir (RTV) on another UGT1A isoenzyme, UGT1A4. Twenty-one healthy volunteers received a single dose of 100 mg of oral lamotrigine on days 1, 13, and 27; on each occasion blood was sampled before the dose was administered and through 120 h after ingestion of the drug. On days 8-17 the subjects received oral ATV 400 mg q.d. On days 18-30 the subjects received oral ATV 300 mg plus oral RTV 100 mg q.d. Seventeen subjects were evaluable for pharmacokinetic analysis. Geometric mean ratios (+90% confidence intervals (CIs)) of lamotrigine area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)(0-inf) and peak plasma concentration (C(max)) for ATV + lamotrigine and for lamotrigine alone were 0.88 (0.86-0.91) and 0.99 (0.95-1.02), respectively; the corresponding ratios for ATV\/RTV and for lamotrigine were 0.68 (0.65-0.70) and 0.94 (0.90-0.97), respectively. The mean ratio of lamotrigine-2N-glucuronide to lamotrigine AUC(0-inf) increased from 0.45 for lamotrigine to 0.71 for ATV\/RTV + lamotrigine. ATV alone does not significantly influence glucuronidation of lamotrigine. In contrast, ATV\/RTV results in moderately decreased exposure to lamotrigine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000580f","authors":["Burger DM","Huisman A","Van Ewijk N","Neisingh H","Van Uden P","Rongen GA","Koopmans P","Bertz RJ"],"doi":"10.1038\/clpt.2008.106","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T07:40:42+00:00","issns":["0009-9236","1532-6535"],"issue":"6","journal":"Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1213747200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18528434","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/clpt.2008.106"],"pmid":"18528434","pubdate":"2008-06-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"The Effect of Atazanavir and Atazanavir\/Ritonavir on UDP\u2010Glucuronosyltransferase Using Lamotrigine as a Phenotypic Probe","type":"article","volume":"84","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-atazanavir-atazanavirritonavir-udpglucuronosyltransferase-using-lamotrigine-phenotypic-probe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630679,"mean":4.9289340563991,"rank":2015518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":942380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630679,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231903,"mean":3.9138595527424,"rank":99993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231903,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":977,"mean":3.2278381147541,"rank":597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":977,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":3.1727894736842,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
