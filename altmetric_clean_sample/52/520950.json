Macrophage function is pivotal to the development of these two aspects during sepsis; however, the mechanisms underlying these changes remain unclear. Here we report that the PD-1:PD-L pathway appears to be a determining factor of the outcome of sepsis, regulating the delicate balance between effectiveness and damage by the antimicrobial immune response. To this end we observed that PD-1(-\/-) mice were markedly protected from the lethality of sepsis, accompanied by a decreased bacterial burden and suppressed inflammatory cytokine response. To the extent that this is a macrophage-specific aspect of the effects of PD-1, we found the following: first, peritoneal macrophages expressed significantly higher levels of PD-1 during sepsis, which was associated with their development of cellular dysfunction; second, when peritoneal macrophages were depleted (using clodronate liposomes) from PD-1(-\/-) mice, the animals' bactericidal capacity was lowered, their inflammatory cytokine levels were elevated, and protection from septic lethality was diminished; and third, blood monocytes from both septic mice and patients with septic shock shared markedly increased PD-1 levels. Together, these data suggest that PD-1 may not only be a dysfunctional marker\/effector of macrophages\/monocytes, but may also be a potential therapeutic target for designing measures to modulate the innate immune response, thereby preventing the detrimental effects of sepsis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2009PNAS..106.6303H","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Huang X","Venet F","Wang YL","Lepape A","Yuan Z","Chen Y","Swan R","Kherouf H","Monneret G","Chung CS","Ayala A"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.0809422106","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T04:03:45+00:00","issns":["0027-8424","1091-6490"],"issue":"15","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1252281600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19332785","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.0809422106"],"pmcid":"PMC2669369","pmid":"19332785","pubdate":"2009-04-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"PD-1 expression by macrophages plays a pathologic role in altering microbial clearance and the innate inflammatory response to sepsis","type":"article","volume":"106","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pd1-expression-macrophages-plays-pathologic-role-altering-microbial-clearance-innate-inflammatory-re"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3929898,"mean":5.0177611403879,"rank":2185609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1018735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3929898,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232966,"mean":3.9663415637156,"rank":101181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232966,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35084,"mean":13.941483449751,"rank":24037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":5072,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35084,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":772,"mean":12.431805447471,"rank":492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":772,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":25,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Student  > Ph.
