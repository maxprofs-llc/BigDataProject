To better understand this dichotomy, we compared acute pathogenic SIV infection in pigtailed macaques (PTs) to non-pathogenic infection in African green monkeys (AGMs). SIVagm-infected PTs, but not SIVagm-infected AGMs, rapidly developed systemic immune activation, marked and selective depletion of IL-17-secreting (Th17) cells, and loss of the balance between Th17 and T regulatory (Treg) cells in blood, lymphoid organs, and mucosal tissue. The loss of Th17 cells was found to be predictive of systemic and sustained T cell activation. Collectively, these data indicate that loss of the Th17 to Treg balance is related to SIV disease progression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334c","authors":["Favre D","Lederer S","Kanwar B","Ma ZM","Proll S","Kasakow Z","Mold J","Swainson L","Barbour JD","Baskin CR","Palermo R","Pandrea I","Miller CJ","Katze MG","McCune JM","David Favre","Sharon Lederer","Bittoo Kanwar","Zhong-Min Ma","Sean Proll","Zeljka Kasakow","Jeff Mold","Louise Swainson","Jason D.
