Unlike other coexpression tools, CressExpress allows characterization of tissue-specific coexpression networks through user-driven filtering of input data based on sample tissue type. CressExpress also performs pathway-level coexpression analysis on each set of query genes, identifying and ranking genes based on their common connections with two or more query genes. This allows identification of novel candidates for involvement in common processes and functions represented by the query group. Users launch experiments using an easy-to-use Web-based interface and then receive the full complement of results, along with a record of tool settings and parameters, via an e-mail link to the CressExpress Web site. Data sets featured in CressExpress are strictly versioned and include expression data from MAS5, GCRMA, and RMA array processing algorithms. To demonstrate applications for CressExpress, we present coexpression analyses of cellulose synthase genes, indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis, and flowering. We show that subselecting sample types produces a richer network for genes involved in flowering in Arabidopsis. CressExpress provides direct access to expression values via an easy-to-use URL-based Web service, allowing users to determine quickly if their query genes are coexpressed with each other and likely to yield informative pathway-level coexpression results.
