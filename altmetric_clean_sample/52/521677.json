Despite their importance, the regulation of integrin clustering by the cytoplasmic adapter protein talin (Tal) and phosphatidylinositol (PI)-4,5-biphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)) lipids nor their dynamic coupling to the actin cytoskeleton is fully understood. By using a Tal-dependent integrin clustering assay in intact cells, we identified a PI(4,5)P(2)-binding basic ridge spanning across the F2 and F3 domains of the Tal head that regulates integrin clustering. Clustering requires a new PI(4,5)P(2)-binding site in F2 and is negatively regulated by autoinhibitory interactions between F3 and the Tal rod (Tal-R). The release of the Tal-R exposes a new beta3-integrin-binding site in F3, enabling interaction with a membrane proximal acidic motif, which involves the formation of salt bridges between K(316) and K(324) with E(726) and D(723), respectively. This interaction shields the beta-integrin tail from reassociation with its alpha subunit, thereby maintaining the integrin in a substrate-binding and clustering-competent form.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce3","authors":["Saltel F","Mortier E","Hyt\u00f6nen VP","Jacquier MC","Zimmermann P","Vogel V","Liu W","Wehrle-Haller B"],"doi":"10.1083\/jcb.200908134","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T04:25:37+00:00","issns":["0021-9525","1540-8140"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1267574400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19948488","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1083\/jcb.200908134"],"pmcid":"PMC2806581","pmid":"19948488","pubdate":"2009-12-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Rockefeller University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"New PI(4,5)P2- and membrane proximal integrin\u2013binding motifs in the talin head control \u03b23-integrin clustering","type":"article","volume":"187","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-pi45p2-membrane-proximal-integrinbinding-motifs-talin-head-control-%CE%B23integrin-clustering"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616176,"mean":4.9318698536468,"rank":2015337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":924336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616176,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231493,"mean":3.9558175574103,"rank":100665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231493,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4069,"mean":3.265651425762,"rank":2393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4069,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255,"mean":2.9880157480315,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":27,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
