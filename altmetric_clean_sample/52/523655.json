Although the possibility that alpha-catenin acts as a direct linker between the membrane and the actin cytoskeleton for AJ formation and function has been minimized, here we show that alpha-catenin recruits vinculin, another main actin-binding protein of AJs, through force-dependent changes in alpha-catenin conformation. We identified regions in the alpha-catenin molecule that are required for its force-dependent binding of vinculin by introducing mutant alpha-catenin into cells and using in vitro binding assays. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis for alpha-catenin mobility and the existence of an antibody recognizing alpha-catenin in a force-dependent manner further supported the notion that alpha-catenin is a tension transducer that translates mechanical stimuli into a chemical response, resulting in AJ development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003163","authors":["Yonemura S","Wada Y","Watanabe T","Nagafuchi A","Shibata M"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncb2055","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T05:22:29+00:00","issns":["1465-7392","1476-4679"],"issue":"6","journal":"Nature Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1376006400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20453849","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ncb2055"],"pmid":"20453849","pubdate":"2010-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"|[alpha]|-Catenin as a tension transducer that induces adherens junction development","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/%CE%B1catenin-tension-transducer-induces-adherens-junction-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630112,"mean":4.9307700568987,"rank":2015675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":941505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630112,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231901,"mean":3.9166482708067,"rank":100030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90718,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231901,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1989,"mean":5.6812837022133,"rank":1205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1989,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":3.1035833333333,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":38,"Student  > Doctoral Student":16,"Researcher":102,"Student  > Ph.
