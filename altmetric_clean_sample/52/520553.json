Continuous emphasis on this intervention has lead to the widespread opinion that HAI rates can be greatly reduced by increased hand hygiene compliance alone. However, this assumes that the effectiveness of hand hygiene is not constrained by other factors and that improved compliance in excess of a given level, in itself, will result in a commensurate reduction in the incidence of HAI. However, several researchers have found the law of diminishing returns to apply to hand hygiene, with the greatest benefits occurring in the first 20% or so of compliance, and others have demonstrated that poor cohorting of nursing staff profoundly influences the effectiveness of hand hygiene measures. Collectively, these findings raise intriguing questions about the extent to which increasing compliance alone can further reduce rates of HAI.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","authors":["Beggs CB","Shepherd SJ","Kerr KG","Clive B Beggs","Simon J Shepherd","Kevin G Kerr"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2334-8-114","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T03:48:39+00:00","issns":["","1471-2334"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1498114704,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18764942","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/18764942\/?i=3&from=\/24144553\/related","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2553083\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2553083","https:\/\/bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2334-8-114"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/1471-2334-8-114?site=bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC2553083","pmid":"18764942","pubdate":"2008-09-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"114","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Increasing the frequency of hand washing by healthcare workers does not lead to commensurate reductions in staphylococcal infection in a hospital ward.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increasing-frequency-hand-washing-healthcare-workers-not-lead-commensurate-reductions-staphylococcal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.35,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":1795918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6601786,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252318,"mean":5.1885348985604,"rank":49749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":202155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252318,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3744,"mean":3.9710772107935,"rank":726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3744,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":2.8782432432432,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
