Here we show that the acetyltransferase MOF (males absent on the first) acetylates TIP5, the largest subunit of NoRC, at a single lysine residue, K633, adjacent to the TIP5 RNA-binding domain, and that the NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 (sirtuin-1) removes the acetyl group from K633. Acetylation regulates the interaction of NoRC with promoter-associated RNA (pRNA), which in turn affects heterochromatin formation, nucleosome positioning and rDNA silencing. Significantly, NoRC acetylation is responsive to the intracellular energy status and fluctuates during S phase. Activation of SIRT1 on glucose deprivation leads to deacetylation of K633, enhanced pRNA binding and an increase in heterochromatic histone marks. These results suggest a mechanism that links the epigenetic state of rDNA to cell metabolism and reveal another layer of epigenetic control that involves post-translational modification of a chromatin remodelling complex.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003163","authors":["Zhou Y","Schmitz KM","Mayer C","Yuan X","Akhtar A","Grummt I","Yonggang Zhou","Kerstin-Maike Schmitz","Christine Mayer","Xuejun Yuan","Asifa Akhtar","Ingrid Grummt"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncb1914","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T06:38:43+00:00","issns":["1465-7392","1476-4679"],"issue":"8","journal":"Nature Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1252972800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19578370","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ncb1914"],"pmid":"19578370","pubdate":"2009-07-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Reversible acetylation of the chromatin remodelling complex NoRC is required for non-coding RNA-dependent silencing","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ncb1914","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reversible-acetylation-chromatin-remodelling-complex-norc-required-noncoding-rnadependent-silencing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626012,"mean":4.9497445252532,"rank":2018874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":930399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626012,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231867,"mean":3.9515100445949,"rank":100597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231867,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1989,"mean":5.7118058350101,"rank":1207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1989,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":3.0954166666667,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":13,"Researcher":35,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
