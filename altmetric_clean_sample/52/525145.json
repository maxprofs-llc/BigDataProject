Recent evidence indicates that disruption of functional and structural dopaminergic development may be at the core of the developmental neuropathology associated with psychosis-related abnormalities induced by prenatal exposure to infection. Using a mouse model of prenatal immune challenge by the viral mimic polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid, the present study critically evaluated this hypothesis by longitudinally monitoring the effects of maternal immune challenge during pregnancy on structural and functional dopaminergic development in the offspring from fetal to adult stages of life. Our study shows that prenatal immune challenge leads to dopaminergic maldevelopment starting as early as in the fetal stages of life and produces a set of postnatal dopaminergic abnormalities that is dependent on postnatal maturational processes. Furthermore, our longitudinal investigations reveal a striking developmental correspondence between the ontogeny of specific dopaminergic neuropathology and the postnatal onset of distinct forms of dopamine-dependent functional abnormalities implicated in schizophrenia. Prenatal immune activation thus appears to be a significant environmental risk factor for primary defects in normal dopaminergic development and facilitates the expression of postnatal dopamine dysfunctions involved in the precipitation of psychosis-related behavior. Early interventions targeting the developing dopamine system may open new avenues for a successful attenuation or even prevention of psychotic disorders following neurodevelopmental disruption of dopamine functions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Vuillermot S","Weber L","Feldon J","Meyer U"],"doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.5408-09.2010","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T06:04:06+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1267401600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20107055"],"pmid":"20107055","pubdate":"2010-01-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Routledge","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"A longitudinal examination of the neurodevelopmental impact of prenatal immune activation in mice reveals primary defects in dopaminergic development relevant to schizophrenia.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longitudinal-examination-neurodevelopmental-impact-prenatal-immune-activation-mice-reveals-primary-d"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616414,"mean":4.9310398369908,"rank":2015264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":924400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616414,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231493,"mean":3.9554470478463,"rank":100653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89060,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231493,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9096,"mean":6.1657064321056,"rank":4991,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9096,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283,"mean":3.5055177304965,"rank":140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
