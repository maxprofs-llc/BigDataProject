Improving ADCC responses is desirable because it is thought to be an important antitumor mechanism for some Abs. NK cell inhibitory receptors, such as killer cell Ig-like receptors, engage with MHC class I molecules on self-cells to block NK cell activation. Accordingly, we enhanced ADCC responses by blocking NK cell inhibitory receptors, thus perturbing induction of the self-recognition signal. In a cell line model of anti-lymphoma therapy, the combination of rituximab with an Ab that blocks inhibitory self-recognition yielded increased NK cell-mediated target cell lysis when compared with rituximab alone. To validate this proof-of-concept, we then used a more representative approach in which an individual's fresh primary NK cells encountered autologous, EBV-transformed B cells. In this system, rituximab and a combination of Abs that block NK cell inhibitory receptors yielded improved NK cell-mediated lysis over rituximab alone. The results show, for the first time, that disruption of inhibitory self-recognition can efficiently promote ADCC in a human model, applying an autologous system in which physiologic checkpoints are in place. This method provides an alternative approach to potentiate the therapeutic benefit of antitumor Abs that mediate ADCC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Binyamin L","Alpaugh RK","Hughes TL","Lutz CT","Campbell KS","Weiner LM"],"first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T05:02:10+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"9","journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1392819804,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18424763","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2810560\/"],"pmcid":"PMC2810560","pmid":"18424763","pubdate":"2008-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Blocking NK cell inhibitory self-recognition promotes antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in a model of anti-lymphoma therapy.","type":"article","volume":"180","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blocking-nk-cell-inhibitory-selfrecognition-promotes-antibodydependent-cellular-cytotoxicity-model-a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7342523,"mean":6.378234953871,"rank":1385544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5948846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7342523,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246316,"mean":4.8054839859532,"rank":43279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":202718,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246316,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6913,"mean":2.5998857060185,"rank":590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":6319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6913,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":430,"mean":1.1667878787879,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":430,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Ph.
