Here we investigated the signaling events controlling LFA-1 affinity triggering by chemokines in human primary T lymphocytes. We found that the small GTPase Rac1 mediated chemokine-induced LFA-1 affinity triggering and lymphocyte arrest in high endothelial venules. Unexpectedly, another Rho family member, Cdc42, negatively regulated LFA-1 activation. The Rho effectors PLD1 and PIP5KC were also critical to LFA-1 affinity modulation. Notably, PIP5KC was found to specifically control the transition of LFA-1 from an extended low-intermediate state to a high-affinity state, which correlated with lymphocyte arrest. Thus, chemokines control lymphocyte trafficking by triggering a Rho-dependent signaling cascade leading to conformer-specific modulation of LFA-1 affinity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003165","authors":["Bolomini-Vittori M","Montresor A","Giagulli C","Staunton D","Rossi B","Martinello M","Constantin G","Laudanna C"],"doi":"10.1038\/ni.1691","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T07:43:37+00:00","issns":["1529-2908","1529-2916"],"issue":"2","journal":"Nature Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1241049600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19136961","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ni.1691"],"pmid":"19136961","pubdate":"2009-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Regulation of conformer-specific activation of the integrin LFA-1 by a chemokine-triggered Rho signaling module","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regulation-conformerspecific-activation-integrin-lfa1-chemokinetriggered-rho-signaling-module"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619418,"mean":4.9280690829525,"rank":2016325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":927263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619418,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231765,"mean":3.9492939714539,"rank":100635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231765,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1557,"mean":4.879618251928,"rank":791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1557,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":2.2148275862069,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":23,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
