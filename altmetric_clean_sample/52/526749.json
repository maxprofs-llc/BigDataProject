We propose that TRPM5, a Ca(2+)-activated monovalent cation channel, is a positive regulator of glucose-induced insulin release. Immunofluorescence revealed expression of TRPM5 in pancreatic islets. A Ca(2+)-activated nonselective cation current with TRPM5-like properties is significantly reduced in Trpm5(-\/-) cells. Ca(2+)-imaging and electrophysiological analysis show that glucose-induced oscillations of V(m) and [Ca(2+)](cyt) have on average a reduced frequency in Trpm5(-\/-) islets, specifically due to a lack of fast oscillations. As a consequence, glucose-induced insulin release from Trpm5(-\/-) pancreatic islets is significantly reduced, resulting in an impaired glucose tolerance in Trpm5(-\/-) mice.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2010PNAS..107.5208C","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Colsoul B","Schraenen A","Lemaire K","Quintens R","Van Lommel L","Segal A","Owsianik G","Talavera K","Voets T","Margolskee RF","Kokrashvili Z","Gilon P","Nilius B","Schuit FC","Vennekens R"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.0913107107","endpage":"5213","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T06:43:28+00:00","issns":["0027-8424","1091-6490"],"issue":"11","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1491295932,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20194741","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.0913107107"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/107\/11\/5208.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC2841940","pmid":"20194741","pubdate":"2010-03-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"5208","subjects":["science"],"title":"Loss of high-frequency glucose-induced Ca2+ oscillations in pancreatic islets correlates with impaired glucose tolerance in Trpm5\u2212\/\u2212 mice","type":"article","volume":"107","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/loss-highfrequency-glucoseinduced-ca2-oscillations-pancreatic-islets-correlates-impaired-glucose-tol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":1869863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6525302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252523,"mean":5.2006305906023,"rank":51862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":198825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252523,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46912,"mean":24.586823730042,"rank":20303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":25550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46912,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":803,"mean":16.727069825436,"rank":370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":803,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Ph.
