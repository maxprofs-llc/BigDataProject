The present study aimed to replicate these associations; in addition, the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) was assessed. The polymorphisms were genotyped in subjects recruited from the normal population (n = 510), and possible associations between genotype and body mass index (BMI) were assessed. The Ser23 allele was more common in underweight subjects (BMI <20) than in normal- and overweight (BMI > or =20) subjects (P = .006). The T allele of the -759C\/T polymorphism was less common in the overweight group (BMI > or =25) (P = .007). Homozygosity for the short allele of 5-HTTLPR was more frequent in underweight subjects (P = .015). Our results are in agreement with previous studies, suggesting polymorphisms in HTR2C to be associated with body weight, particularly in women; and they also suggest that 5-HTTLPR may influence this phenotype. Further studies on the importance of the investigated genes for eating disorders and drug-induced weight gain are warranted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f61000816c","authors":["Bah J","Westberg L","Baghaei F","Henningsson S","Rosmond R","Melke J","Holm G","Eriksson E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.metabol.2009.11.007","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T05:11:17+00:00","issns":["0026-0495"],"issue":"8","journal":"Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental","last_mentioned_on":1288828800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20092861","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.metabol.2009.11.007"],"pmid":"20092861","pubdate":"2010-01-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"Further exploration of the possible influence of polymorphisms in HTR2C and 5HTT on body weight","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/further-exploration-possible-influence-polymorphisms-htr2c-5htt-body-weight"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628216,"mean":4.9435109727551,"rank":2017574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":935061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628216,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231889,"mean":3.9370089698477,"rank":100357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":90065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231889,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":708,"mean":4.7225799151344,"rank":371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":708,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":3.2644,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
