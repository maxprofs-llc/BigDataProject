A comprehensive, detailed and robust phylogeny of Streptomyces and its relatives is needed for understanding how this group emerged and maintained such a vast diversity throughout evolution and how soil-living mycelial forms (e.g., Streptomyces s. str.) are related to parasitic, unicellular pathogens (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or marine species (e.g., Salinispora tropica). The most important application area of such a phylogenetic analysis will be in the comparative re-annotation of genome sequences and the reconstruction of Streptomyces metabolic networks for biotechnology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000311a","authors":["Alam MT","Merlo ME","Takano E","Breitling R","Mohammad Tauqeer Alam","Maria Elena Merlo","Eriko Takano","Rainer Breitling"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ympev.2009.11.019","endpage":"772","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T05:03:04+00:00","issns":["1055-7903","10557903"],"issue":"3","journal":"Molecular Phylogenetics & Evolution","last_mentioned_on":1272931200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19948233","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ympev.2009.11.019"],"pmid":"19948233","pubdate":"2009-12-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"763","subjects":["molecularbiology","biology"],"title":"Genome-based phylogenetic analysis of Streptomyces and its relatives.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1055790309004783","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomebased-phylogenetic-analysis-streptomyces-relatives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4681522,"mean":5.6990934027662,"rank":2490786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1553238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4681522,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235630,"mean":4.4310960874936,"rank":102086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":101357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235630,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1825,"mean":3.9211940789474,"rank":1425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1825,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":7.8952307692308,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":23,"Student  > Ph.
