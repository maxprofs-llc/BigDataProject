This leads to ENaC endocytosis and possible degradation. Because ENaC is known to recycle at the apical membranes of CCD cells, deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are likely involved in regulating ENaC surface density by facilitating ENaC recycling as opposed to degradation. Using a chemical probe approach to tag active DUBs, we identified ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH) isoform L3 as the predominant DUB in endosomal compartments of CCD cells. Blocking UCH-L3 activity or reducing its expression by selective knockdown increased ENaC ubiquitination and resulted in its removal from the apical membranes of CCD cells. Functionally this caused a rapid reduction in transepithelial Na(+) currents across the CCD epithelia. Surface biotinylation demonstrated the loss of ENaC from the apical surface when UCH-L3 was inhibited. Whole cell or apical surface immunoprecipitation demonstrated increased ENaC ubiquitination with UCH-L3 inhibition. This constitutes a novel function for UCH in epithelia and in the regulation of ion channels and demonstrates the dynamic regulation of apically located ENaC by recycling, which is facilitated by this DUB.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Butterworth, Michael B","Edinger, Robert S","Ovaa, Huib","Burg, Danny","Johnson, John P","Frizzell, Raymond A"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m707989200","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T07:26:20+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"52","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1194220800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17967898"],"pmid":"17967898","pubdate":"2007-12-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The deubiquitinating enzyme UCH-L3 regulates the apical membrane recycling of the epithelial sodium channel.","type":"article","volume":"282","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/deubiquitinating-enzyme-uchl3-regulates-apical-membrane-recycling-epithelial-sodium-channel"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630432,"mean":4.9299514944696,"rank":2015608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":941970,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630432,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231902,"mean":3.9151730867917,"rank":100012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90766,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231902,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28043,"mean":2.6400806647172,"rank":19771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":4085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28043,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1193,"mean":1.5505587248322,"rank":380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1193,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
