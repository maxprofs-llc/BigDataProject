The SNARE complex, composed of the plasma membrane t-SNAREs syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 and the vesicle v-SNARE synaptobrevin, mediates the fusion of 2 membranes. Synaptic vesicles contain unusually high cholesterol, but the exact role of cholesterol in fusion is not known. In this study, cholesterol was found to stimulate SNARE-mediated lipid mixing of proteoliposomes by a factor of 5 at a physiological concentration. Surprisingly, however, the stimulatory effect was more pronounced when cholesterol was on the v-SNARE side than when it was on the t-SNARE side. Site-directed spin labeling and both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed EPR revealed that cholesterol induces a conformational change of the v-SNARE transmembrane domain (TMD) from an open scissors-like dimer to a parallel dimer. When the TMD was forced to form a parallel dimer by the disulfide bond, the rate was stimulated 2.3-fold even without cholesterol, supporting the relevance of the open-to-closed conformational change to the fusion activity. The open scissors-like conformation may be unfavorable for fusion and cholesterol may relieve this inhibitory factor.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2009PNAS..106.5141T","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Tong J","Borbat PP","Freed JH","Shin YK"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.0813138106","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T05:20:56+00:00","issns":["0027-8424","1091-6490"],"issue":"13","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1236902400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19251653","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.0813138106"],"pmcid":"PMC2663986","pmid":"19251653","pubdate":"2009-03-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"A scissors mechanism for stimulation of SNARE-mediated lipid mixing by cholesterol","type":"article","volume":"106","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/scissors-mechanism-stimulation-snaremediated-lipid-mixing-cholesterol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633617,"mean":4.9215564192856,"rank":2015200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":946960,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633617,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231918,"mean":3.9023482194064,"rank":99761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231918,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33625,"mean":13.605935284321,"rank":23212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":4513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33625,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":766,"mean":12.240154248366,"rank":484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":766,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
