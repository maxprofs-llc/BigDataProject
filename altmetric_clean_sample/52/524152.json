In this study, we have identified interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a critical inflammatory cytokine that alters the balance between the effector and regulatory arms of the immune system and drives a proinflammatory phenotype that is a defining characteristic of GVHD. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of the IL-6 signaling pathway by way of antibody-mediated blockade of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) markedly reduces pathologic damage attributable to GVHD. This is accompanied by a significant increase in the absolute number of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that is due to augmentation of thymic-dependent and thymic-independent Treg production. Correspondingly, there is a significant reduction in the number of T helper 1 and T helper 17 cells in GVHD target organs, demonstrating that blockade of IL-6 signaling decreases the ratio of proinflammatory T cells to Tregs. These studies demonstrate that antibody blockade of the IL-6R serves to recalibrate the effector and regulatory arms of the immune system and represents a novel, potentially clinically translatable, strategy for the attenuation of GVHD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Chen X","Das R","Komorowski R","Beres A","Hessner MJ","Mihara M","Drobyski WR"],"doi":"10.1182\/blood-2009-01-197178","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T05:38:02+00:00","issns":["1528-0020"],"issue":"4","journal":"Blood","last_mentioned_on":1393432920,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19491393","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19491393?dopt=Citation","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1182\/blood-2009-01-197178"],"pmid":"19491393","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society of Hematology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Blockade of interleukin-6 signaling augments regulatory T-cell reconstitution and attenuates the severity of graft-versus-host disease","type":"article","volume":"114","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blockade-interleukin6-signaling-augments-regulatory-tcell-reconstitution-attenuates-severity-graftve"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8059254,"mean":6.8391404707078,"rank":3787991,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4092527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8059254,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250290,"mean":5.0860370531667,"rank":94475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":147333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250290,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9604,"mean":5.5153810267625,"rank":5329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":3973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9604,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":703,"mean":2.299452991453,"rank":254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":703,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
