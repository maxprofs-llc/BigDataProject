They are involved in developmental, metabolic, and tumorigenic processes. Maf proteins are overexpressed in about 50% of human multiple myelomas. Here, we show that Maf-transforming activity is controlled by GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation and that phosphorylation by GSK-3 can increase the oncogenic activity of a protein. Using microarray analysis, we identify a gene-expression subprogram regulated by GSK-3-mediated Maf phosphorylation involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and relevant to cancer progression. We also demonstrate that GSK-3 triggers MafA sequential phosphorylation on residues S61, T57, T53, and S49, inducing its ubiquitination and degradation. Paradoxically, this phosphorylation increases MafA-transcriptional activity through the recruitment of the coactivator P\/CAF. We further demonstrate that P\/CAF protects MafA from ubiquitination and degradation, suggesting that, upon the release of the coactivator complex, MafA becomes polyubiquitinated and degraded to allow the response to terminate.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ba","authors":["Rocques, Nathalie","Abou Zeid, Nancy","Sii-Felice, Karine","Lecoin, Laure","Felder-Schmittbuhl, Marie-Paule","Eych\u00e8ne, Alain","Pouponnot, Celio"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.molcel.2007.11.009","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T06:24:12+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1097-2765"],"issue":"4","journal":"Molecular Cell","last_mentioned_on":1198108800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18042454"],"pmid":"18042454","pubdate":"2007-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation enhances Maf-transforming activity.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gsk3mediated-phosphorylation-enhances-maftransforming-activity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633792,"mean":4.9212574058383,"rank":2015193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633792,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231918,"mean":3.9015249421132,"rank":99741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231918,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3053,"mean":4.0892975098296,"rank":1743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3053,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":2.3847543859649,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
