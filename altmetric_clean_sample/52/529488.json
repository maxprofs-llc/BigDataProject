The Legionella pneumophila protein DrrA displaces GDI from Rab1:GDI complexes, incorporating Rab1 into Legionella-containing vacuoles and activating Rab1 by exchanging GDP for GTP. Here, we present the crystal structure of a complex between the GEF domain of DrrA and Rab1 and a detailed kinetic analysis of this exchange. DrrA efficiently catalyzes nucleotide exchange and mimics the general nucleotide exchange mechanism of mammalian GEFs for Ras-like GTPases. We show that the GEF activity of DrrA is sufficient to displace prenylated Rab1 from the Rab1:GDI complex. Thus, apparent GDI displacement by DrrA is linked directly to nucleotide exchange, suggesting a basic model for GDI displacement and specificity of Rab localization that does not require discrete GDI displacement activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ba","authors":["Schoebel S","Oesterlin LK","Blankenfeldt W","Goody RS","Itzen A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.molcel.2009.11.014","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T07:56:20+00:00","issns":["1097-2765"],"issue":"6","journal":"Molecular Cell","last_mentioned_on":1264377600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20064470","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.molcel.2009.11.014"],"pmid":"20064470","pubdate":"2010-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"RabGDI Displacement by DrrA from Legionella Is a Consequence of Its Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Activity","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rabgdi-displacement-drra-legionella-consequence-guanine-nucleotide-exchange-activity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630679,"mean":4.9289340563991,"rank":2015491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":942535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630679,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231904,"mean":3.9133439412171,"rank":99984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231904,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3051,"mean":4.0834137704918,"rank":1744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3051,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":2.4198421052632,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Ph.
