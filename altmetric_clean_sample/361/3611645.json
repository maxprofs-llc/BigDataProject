The pain associated to these lesions is disproportionate to their size.Martorell ulcer designates a specific disease entity that occurs predominantly in middle-aged women with poorly controlled hypertension in the form of skin ulcers on the anterolateral aspect of the lower legs. The lesions initially appear as small, painful blisters which may or may not be associated with trauma. The pathophysiology of Martorell ulcer is assumed to be related to hypertension-induced arteriole changes in the dermis. The pain is often disproportionate, and the symptoms are not relieved by rest or elevation.Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an accepted evidence-based therapy for the treatment of chronic ischemic pain. Spinal cord stimulation is used as a therapeutic tool in the management of this disease not only for symptomatic pain control but also for accelerating the healing process through its effects on causal mechanisms. The beneficial effects of SCS when used to treat ischemic pain include pain relief, decreased infarction or ulcer size, decreased oxygen requirements, and increased claudication distance. Clinical and basic studies indicate that these beneficial effects are mainly associated with an increase or redistribution of blood flow to the ischemic area and\/or normalization of the activity in the nervous system.We present the case of a 71-year-old woman diagnosed with Martorell ulcer in the acute phase of the disease. The patient was treated with SCS to achieve both pain relief and healing of the cutaneous ulcer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c87","doi":"10.1097\/aap.0b013e31820308b2","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T21:35:25+00:00","issns":["1098-7339"],"issue":"1","journal":"Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1308451241,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/rapm\/Abstract\/2011\/01000\/Use_of_a_Spinal_Cord_Stimulator_for_Treatment_of.16.aspx","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/AAP.0b013e31820308b2","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21455092"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/rapm\/2011\/01000\/Use_of_a_Spinal_Cord_Stimulator_for_Treatment_of.16.pdf","pmid":"21455092","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"83","subjects":["anesthesiology","psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Use of a spinal cord stimulator for treatment of Martorell hypertensive ulcer.","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spinal-cord-stimulator-treatment-martorell-hypertensive-ulcer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628077,"mean":4.9442940120368,"rank":817298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628077,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95109,"mean":8.1986076881021,"rank":24706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95109,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":700,"mean":2.2427067238913,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":700,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":5.925,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":10,"Neuroscience":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":4,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CA":2,"ES":2}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Martorell's ulcer","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=435027968#altmetric_citation_2","license":"public","citation_ids":[3611645],"posted_on":"2011-06-19T02:40:41+00:00","summary":"Martorell's ulcer is a painful ulceration of the lower leg associated with diastolic arterial hypertension.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=25761566","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Drankush","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Drankush"}}]}}
