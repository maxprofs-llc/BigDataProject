Its clinical picture presents as an erythema of the buttocks and upper inner thighs resembling the red bottom of baboons. This specific reaction was originally observed with mercury, nickel and ampicillin. Since then over 100 cases have been described, most of them without known prior sensitization to the causative agent. In 2004, our group proposed the acronym SDRIFE specifically for cases associated with systemic drugs; it stands for symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema, as a distinct reaction pattern related to systemic drugs. Here we describe a case of SDRIFE after administration of the iodinated radio contrast medium (RCM) iomeprol (Iomeron), accidentally reproduced by the RCM iopromide (Ultravist). Positive delayed skin tests with both drugs were observed indicating that the pathomechanism of SDRIFE is likely a cell-mediated type IV allergy. Oral potassium iodide and a skin-test-negative RCM were administered and both tolerated, indicating that the antigen is related to the molecules and not to iodine itself. Therefore, in our case skin tests had a good positive and negative predictive value.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f6100070d4","authors":["Arnold, A.W.","H\u00e4usermann, P.","Bach, S.","Bircher, A.J."],"doi":"10.1159\/000096920","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T21:35:48+00:00","issns":["1421-9832"],"journal":"Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1372688414,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1159\/000096920","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17191055"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/Pdf\/96920","pmid":"17191055","pubdate":"2006-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Karger Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Recurrent flexural exanthema (SDRIFE or baboon syndrome) after administration of two different iodinated radio contrast media.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recurrent-flexural-exanthema-sdrife-baboon-syndrome-after-administration-two-different-iodinated-rad"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":816228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95570,"mean":8.237819355649,"rank":24900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95570,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":399,"mean":2.0671809045226,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":399,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":2.2166666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Arts and Humanities":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"PT":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Baboon syndrome","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=562397960#altmetric_citation_2","license":"public","citation_ids":[3611663],"posted_on":"2013-07-01T14:20:14+00:00","summary":"Baboon syndrome is a systemic contact dermatitis characterized by well-demarcated patches of erythema distributed symmetrically on the buttocks.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=25775378","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Frivadossi","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Frivadossi"}}]}}
