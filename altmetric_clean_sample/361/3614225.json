The influence of these methods on the detection of hospital-acquired CDI and identification of CDI outbreaks was evaluated. We tested 1,592 stool samples for C difficile. The GeneXpert PCR test identified 211 positive samples (68 determined to be hospital-acquired infection), whereas EIA identified 105 positive samples (36 determined to be hospital-acquired infection). The GeneXpert PCR method in contrast to the EIA method increased the detection rates of nosocomial CDI cases and contributed to the declaration of CDI outbreaks.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005709","authors":["Murad YM","Perez J","Nokhbeh R","Ybazeta G","Dewar B","Lefebvre S","Diaz-Mitoma F"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajic.2014.12.021","first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T09:32:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0196-6553"],"journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","last_mentioned_on":1437992400,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ajicjournal.org%2Farticle%2FS0196-6553%252814%252901428-X%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=ymic-site","http:\/\/www.ajicjournal.org\/article\/S0196-6553(14)01428-X\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajicjournal.org\/article\/S019665531401428X\/pdf","pmid":"25687359","pubdate":"2015-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Impact of polymerase chain reaction testing on Clostridium difficile infection rates in an acute health care facility","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-polymerase-chain-reaction-testing-clostridium-difficile-infection-rates-acute-health-care-fac"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5407015,"mean":6.3053667724917,"rank":2871240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1837826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5407015,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191445,"mean":8.8872893065335,"rank":101190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":68676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191445,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1407,"mean":7.3573456614509,"rank":895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1407,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":8.6115869565217,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
