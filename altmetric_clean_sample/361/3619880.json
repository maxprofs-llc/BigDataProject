We found one version of this gene (gene symbol ACAA) in the human genome, in contrast to the situation in rat where two versions have been described. The human gene shows a high structural similarity to the rat genes. It contains 12 exons and 11 introns and spans about 11 kb. We have determined the 5' end of the human thiolase mRNA by employing primer extension analysis and we have sequenced the region upstream of the gene. The putative promoter area displays some of the characteristics typical of promoters of other peroxisomal genes, in that it contains GC elements, but lacks TATA boxes. Finally, no large DNA rearrangement involving the thiolase gene could be observed in a patient suffering from pseudo-Zellweger syndrome (peroxisomal thiolase deficiency).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["A Bout","M M Franse","J Collins","L Blonden","J M Tager","R Benne"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T13:36:38+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0006-3002"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1273518599,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1679347"],"pmid":"1679347","pubdate":"1991-08-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Characterization of the gene encoding human peroxisomal 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase (ACAA).
