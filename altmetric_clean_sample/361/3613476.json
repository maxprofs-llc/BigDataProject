The aim of this study was to analyse the epidemiological pattern of retirements due to medical conditions sustained by tennis players during Davis Cup matches in the 2006-2013 period. All uncompleted matches due to a medical condition (injuries and illnesses) occurred in the above-mentioned competition were collected from the official source, registered and analysed according to published guidelines. The overall incidence of match retirements was 1.66% (12\/719). The injury rate was 6.05\/1000 playing hours; and 6.64\/1000 match exposures. Musculotendinous lesions were the most common type of injury (66.66%). The incidence of lower-limb injuries was higher than upper-limb and trunk lesions. The incidence of retired matches due to medical conditions was higher in hard courts than in clay courts (2.97% and 0.90%, respectively; p = 0.04), while the median value of inactivity of injuries was 32.0 days (range 3-297). In conclusion, the incidence of retirements due to medical conditions in Davis Cup matches was low supporting the assumption that elite tennis is a low-risk sport activity. Findings provided scientific evidences of injury patterns among male professional tennis players and may contribute to conduct better injury prevention strategies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f6100012cd","authors":["Javier Maquirriain","Roberto Baglione","Maquirriain","Maquirriain J","Baglione R"],"doi":"10.1080\/17461391.2015.1009493","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T23:32:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-7290","1746-1391"],"issue":"2","journal":"European Journal of Sport Science","last_mentioned_on":1454875660,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25675134\/?i=1&from=tennis","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/17461391.2015.1009493","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17461391.2015.1009493","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/17461391.2015.1009493","http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/tandf\/tejs\/2016\/00000016\/00000002\/art00014","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17461391.2015.1009493#abstract"],"pmid":"25675134","pubdate":"2015-02-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"title":"Epidemiology of tennis injuries: An eight-year review of Davis Cup retirements","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epidemiology-tennis-injuries-eightyear-review-davis-cup-retirements"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7128274,"mean":6.3030470395816,"rank":1026658,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6099209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7128274,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235652,"mean":8.1068693024855,"rank":42407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":193122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235652,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":716,"mean":14.079493706294,"rank":298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":716,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":19.420606060606,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
