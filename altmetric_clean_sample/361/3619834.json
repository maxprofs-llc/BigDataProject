Thus, the gamma-butyrolactone-induced accumulation of dihydroxyphenylalanine, used as a presynaptic model, was antagonized with ED50 values of 0.29 and 0.09 mumol\/kg in striatum and t. olfactorium, respectively, with high maximal effects. In contrast, striatal acetylcholine concentrations, reflecting actions at normosensitive postsynaptic D-2 receptors, were only moderately increased by about 30% over a dose range of 2.3-68 mumol\/kg. In rats with unilateral nigrostriatal lesions, EMD 49,980 induced long-lasting contralateral turning, indicative of agonistic actions at denervated postsynaptic D-2 receptors. In addition, EMD 49,980 potently inhibited serotonin (5-HT) uptake in vitro and in vivo. Binding studies confirmed D-2 activity in the nM range but, similarly potent effects were observed at 5-HT1A binding sites. Measurement of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) accumulation in the n. raphe revealed that, in vivo, the net effect of EMD 49,980 on 5-HT systems is an agonistic one. Control experiments indicate that inhibition of 5-HTP accumulation by EMD 49,980 is induced mainly via direct activation of 5-HT1A receptors, although some contribution due to 5-HT uptake inhibition is likely. Furthermore, results with various reference compounds make it unlikely that there are indirect effects, also via alpha 2-receptors in the models used and support the view that D-2 agonistic, 5-HT uptake inhibiting and 5-HT1A agonistic actions are independent properties of EMD 49,980.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000284e","authors":["C A Seyfried","H E Greiner","A F Haase"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T13:34:41+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0014-2999"],"issue":"1","journal":"European Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1268378591,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2565817"],"pmid":"2565817","pubdate":"1989-01-24T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Biochemical and functional studies on EMD 49,980: a potent, selectively presynaptic D-2 dopamine agonist with actions on serotonin systems.","type":"article","volume":"160","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biochemical-functional-studies-emd-49-980-potent-selectively-presynaptic-d2-dopamine-agonist-actions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616388,"mean":4.9295982487525,"rank":815319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2277983,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616388,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93964,"mean":7.2300167725595,"rank":23893,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68999,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93964,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1683,"mean":2.33112960761,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1683,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.1439393939394,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
