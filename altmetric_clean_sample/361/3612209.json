Experiments using fMRI can contribute to our understanding of cognition when they are designed to test the predictions of a particular cognitive theory. Although not all cognitive theories make clear predictions about patterns of activity in the brain fMRI experiments are often well suited to testing the predictions of those that do. However, many fMRI studies that are concerned with cognitive functional neuroanatomy are not designed to test predictions of cognitive theories but are instead designed to investigate the role played by different regions of the brain in cognitive activity. These fMRI studies do not shed light on cognitive theories but instead depend on cognitive theories to interpret the data-an interpretation that is only as valid as the cognitive theory on which it is based. These considerations suggest that the relationship between fMRI and theories of cognition is a two-way street.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043af","authors":["John T.
