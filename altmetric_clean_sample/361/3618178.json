Hybridization patterns of Taiwan Taenia DNA revealed distinct variations from that of T. saginata and Taenia solium as well as all other cestode DNAs examined; however, similarities in restriction maps and sequence data between cloned ribosomal gene fragments from Taiwan Taenia (pTTr 3.1) and T. saginata (pTSgr 3.1 and PTSgr 2.4, respectively) suggest close evolutionary relatedness between these two taeniids. DNA sequence amplification from genomic DNA using oligonucleotide primers homologous to regions on both the 2.4- and 3.1-kb fragments was able to delineate between Taiwan Taenia and T. saginata by generating 1.0- and 0.29-kb fragments, respectively. Results demonstrated that Taiwan Taenia is not exclusive to Taiwan but exists in other parts of Eastern Asia and that adult morphology is insufficient for its detection in other locations. Results further support biological data indicating that Taiwan Taenia and T. saginata, although similar morphologically, are distinct genotypes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002898","authors":["D S Zarlenga","D P McManus","P C Fan","J H Cross"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T12:52:49+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0014-4894"],"issue":"2","journal":"Experimental Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1392032789,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1672653"],"pmid":"1672653","pubdate":"1991-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Characterization and detection of a newly described Asian taeniid using cloned ribosomal DNA fragments and sequence amplification by the polymerase chain reaction.","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-detection-newly-described-asian-taeniid-using-cloned-ribosomal-dna-fragments-sequen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3620974,"mean":4.9299989306774,"rank":815952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2281362,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3620974,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94472,"mean":7.2959374411196,"rank":24062,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":69338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94472,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":313,"mean":1.7864487179487,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":313,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.1363636363636,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
