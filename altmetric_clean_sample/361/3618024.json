To test the hypothesis that the anticipatory activity of such neurons depends on the context of stimulus-reward mapping, we examined their activity while the monkeys performed a memory-guided saccade task in which either the position or the color of a cue indicated presence or absence of reward. Some neurons showed anticipatory activity only when a particular position was associated with reward, while others fired selectively for color-reward associations. The functional segregation suggests that caudate neurons participate in feature-based anticipation of visual information that predicts reward. This neuronal code influences the general activity level in response to visual features without improving the quality of visual discrimination.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319c","authors":["Lauwereyns, Johan","Takikawa, Yoriko","Kawagoe, Reiko","Kobayashi, Shunsuke","Koizumi, Masashi","Coe, Brian","Sakagami, Masamichi","Hikosaka, Okihide"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0896-6273(02)00571-8","first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T12:48:31+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0896-6273"],"issue":"3","journal":"Neuron","last_mentioned_on":1291338382,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0896-6273(02)00571-8","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11832232"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S0896627302005718\/pdf","pmid":"11832232","pubdate":"2002-01-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Feature-based anticipation of cues that predict reward in monkey caudate nucleus.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/featurebased-anticipation-cues-predict-reward-monkey-caudate-nucleus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632299,"mean":4.9243828402896,"rank":816003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294040,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632299,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96623,"mean":8.2378182608518,"rank":25317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96623,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3776,"mean":10.055622781457,"rank":1397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3776,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":20.3825,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":17,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":49,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
