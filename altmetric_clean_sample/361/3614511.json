Retinoic acid transcriptionally regulates downstream regulatory molecules, including enzymes, transcription factors, cytokines, and cytokine receptors. Animal models indicate an involvement of retinoid signaling pathways in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and learning, especially in the hippocampus. Retinoic acid-inducible or induced gene 1 (RAI-1) is induced during neuronal differentiation, and was associated with the severity of the phenotype and response to medication in schizophrenic patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082a9","authors":["Johannes Haybaeck","Magdalena Postruznik","Christine L Miller","Jeannette R Dulay","Ida C Llenos","Serge Weis"],"doi":"10.2147\/ndt.s72536","first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T11:10:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1176-6328"],"journal":"Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1423921927,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25678793?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25678793","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"title":"Increased expression of retinoic acid-induced gene 1 in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-expression-retinoic-acidinduced-gene-1-dorsolateral-prefrontal-cortex-schizophrenia-bipola-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4757505,"mean":5.7082384397391,"rank":2360447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2253815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4757505,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172104,"mean":8.8568857370299,"rank":82648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":81483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172104,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":971,"mean":3.5766206185567,"rank":565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":308,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":971,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":5.4329275362319,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
