However, no study has examined the changes in the miRNA transcriptome during PUFA\u2011regulated inflammatory processes. Here, we established PUFA diet\u2011induced autoimmune\u2011prone (AP) and autoimmune\u2011averse (AA) rat models, and studied their physical characteristics and immune status. Additionally, miRNA expression patterns in the rat models were compared using microarray assays and bioinformatic methods. A total of 54\u00a0miRNAs were differentially expressed in common between the AP and the AA rats, and the changes in rno\u2011miR\u201119b\u20113p, \u2011146b\u20115p and \u2011183\u20115p expression were validated using stem\u2011loop reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction. To better understand the mechanisms underlying PUFA\u2011regulated miRNA changes during inflammation, computational algorithms and biological databases were used to identify the target genes of the three validated miRNAs. Furthermore, Gene Ontology\u00a0(GO) term annotation and KEGG pathway analyses of the miRNA targets further allowed to explore the potential implication of the miRNAs in inflammatory pathways. The predicted PUFA\u2011regulated inflammatory pathways included the Toll\u2011like receptor (TLR), T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR), NOD\u2011like receptor\u00a0(NLR), RIG\u2011I\u2011like receptor (RLR), mitogen\u2011activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the transforming growth factor\u2011\u03b2\u00a0(TGF\u2011\u03b2) pathway. This study is the first report, to the best of our knowledge, on in\u00a0vivo comparative profiling of miRNA transcriptomes in PUFA diet\u2011induced inflammatory rat models using a microarray approach. The results provide a useful resource for future investigation of the role of PUFA\u2011regulated miRNAs in immune homeostasis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Zheng Zheng","Yinlin Ge","Jinyu Zhang","Meilan Xue","Quan Li","Dongliang Lin","Wenhui Ma"],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2015.3318","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T23:25:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-3004"],"journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1423910145,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25672643?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25672643"],"pmid":"25672643","pubdate":"2015-02-09T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"PUFA diets alter the microRNA expression\u00a0profiles in an inflammation rat model.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pufa-diets-alter-microrna-expression-profiles-inflammation-rat-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4757505,"mean":5.7082384397391,"rank":2360453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2253817,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4757505,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171141,"mean":8.8386078181609,"rank":81890,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":81325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171141,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1290,"mean":1.0908332040341,"rank":167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1290,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158,"mean":0.856,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
