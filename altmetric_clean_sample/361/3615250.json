Just when the major modes of GR regulation appear known, a new study provides yet another mechanism whereby GR transcriptional activity is controlled under conditions of cell growth arrest. In this case, GR activity is repressed by a small noncoding RNA (ncRNA) from the growth arrest-specific transcript 5 gene that folds into a soluble glucocorticoid response element-like sequence and serves as a decoy for GR DNA binding. This unexpected mode of regulation by nucleic acid molecular mimicry is probably not confined to GR and should spark interest in the hunt for other ncRNAs that regulate transcription factor binding to DNA.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088bc","authors":["Michael J.
