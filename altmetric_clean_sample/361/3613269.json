The European Pharmacopoeia (EP) test is cumbersome and time-consuming especially with respect to the derivatization of red blood cells (RBC) with rubella antigen via tanninization. We investigated the KODE biosurface engineering technology for inserting specific antigens into red blood cell membranes to create kodecytes and evaluated their suitability for use in the Fc function assay.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003711","authors":["Georgakopoulos, T.","Komarraju, S.","Henry, S.","Bertolini, J."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1423-0410.2011.01512.x","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T22:17:39+00:00","issns":["1423-0410"],"journal":"Vox Sanguinis","last_mentioned_on":1337495544,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1423-0410.2011.01512.x","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21749406"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1423-0410.2011.01512.x\/pdf","pmid":"21749406","pubdate":"2011-07-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"An improved Fc function assay utilizing CMV antigen-coated red blood cells generated with synthetic function-spacer-lipid constructs.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improved-fc-function-assay-utilizing-cmv-antigencoated-red-blood-cells-generated-synthetic-functions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627536,"mean":4.9480380313392,"rank":817612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627536,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94952,"mean":8.1608583163949,"rank":24643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94952,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228,"mean":1.8501585903084,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
