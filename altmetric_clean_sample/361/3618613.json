Sample preparation is carried out by liquid-liquid extraction under basic conditions. For an efficient clean up, the analytes are back-extracted into diluted hydrochloric acid and, after alkalinization, are once again extracted into the organic phase. No derivatisation step is performed. The samples are measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with good selectivity. The limit of detection is 2 ng\/ml. The coefficients of variation are 12.6% at 10 ng\/ml and 6.44% at 200 ng\/ml in the day-to-day control measurements.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9253cf058f61000dc5f","authors":["J Martens"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T13:04:19+00:00","issns":["1572-6495"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of chromatography B Biomedical applications","last_mentioned_on":1271392451,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8738042"],"pmid":"8738042","pubdate":"1996-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Determination of the terfenadine metabolite azacyclonol in human serum using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.","type":"article","volume":"678","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/determination-terfenadine-metabolite-azacyclonol-human-serum-using-gas-chromatographymass-spectromet-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627846,"mean":4.9453817817504,"rank":817401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627846,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95778,"mean":8.1625582759954,"rank":24935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95778,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.2,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Azacyclonol","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=356319494#altmetric_citation_2","license":"public","citation_ids":[3618612,3618613],"posted_on":"2010-04-16T04:34:11+00:00","summary":"Azacyclonol (trade names Ataractan, Calmeran, Frenoton, Frenquel, Psychosan), also known as \u03b3-pipradol, is a drug which is a so-called ataractive, or agent which diminishes hallucinations in psychotic individuals.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=26973133","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Vanished 45kd09la13","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Vanished 45kd09la13"}}]}}
