Drugs which affect the venous system have profound effects on haemodynamics. This review comments on the methods available for the determination of venous compliance, resistance, and unstressed volume and describes the mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP) technique, its usefulness and limitations. The MCFP technique involves the measurement of central venous pressure during brief (5-7 s) circulatory arrest. Mathematically, MCFP is inversely proportional to vascular compliance while experimentally, it is a primary determinant of venous return. The MCFP technique provides a reproducible and relatively non-traumatic means for the estimation of body venous tone in conscious and anaesthetised animals. Drugs examined by this technique include alpha and beta adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists, ganglionic blockers, vasoactive peptides (endothelin, vasopressin, angiotensin, neuropeptide Y), and vasodilators (hydralazine, nitroprusside, glyceryl trinitrate, calcium antagonists, and MCI-154).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024b0","authors":["Reza Tabrizchi","Catherine C Y Pang"],"doi":"10.1093\/cvr\/26.5.443","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T21:03:04+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1755-3245","0008-6363"],"issue":"5","journal":"Cardiovascular Research","last_mentioned_on":1253178183,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/cvr\/26.5.443","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1446314"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cardiovascres.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/cardiovascres\/26\/5\/443.full.pdf","pmid":"1446314","pubdate":"1992-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Effects of drugs on body venous tone, as reflected by mean circulatory filling pressure.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-drugs-body-venous-tone-reflected-mean-circulatory-filling-pressure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627846,"mean":4.9453817817504,"rank":817417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627846,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95041,"mean":8.1834284932661,"rank":24680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95041,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":607,"mean":1.9013630363036,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":607,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.66875,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
