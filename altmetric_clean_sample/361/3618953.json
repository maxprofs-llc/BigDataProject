With widespread usage of glycopeptides in both humans and livestock, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) quickly emerged. Bloodstream infections caused by these isolates are of significant concern with limited bactericidal options for treatment. Presently, daptomycin and linezolid serve as the mainstays of therapy, although resistance to both agents has been documented. Newer antimicrobials, specifically lipoglycopeptides and oxazolidinones, have been developed with in vitro activity against these organisms. However, no clinical data are available with their usage for VRE infections, let alone those in the bloodstream. This review focuses on the epidemiology, current and potential future therapeutic options for the treatment of VRE bacteremia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073ca","authors":["Barber KE","King ST","Stover KR","Pogue JM"],"doi":"10.1586\/14787210.2015.1001839","first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T13:11:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"Expert Review of Anti-Infective Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1445350051,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25661903?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25661903?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25661903","pubdate":"2015-02-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Therapeutic options for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/therapeutic-options-retinoblastoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6348733,"mean":5.9808086398984,"rank":1437528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":4280564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6348733,"percentile":67},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199244,"mean":8.7036497141682,"rank":58525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":137810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199244,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":492,"mean":3.0154623217923,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":492,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.18536,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
