Tools for the quantitative analysis of these networks are being developed today. Protein network-based drug target identification methods usually return protein hubs with large degrees in the networks as potentially important targets. Some known, important protein targets, however, are not hubs at all, and perturbing protein hubs in these networks may have several unwanted physiological effects, due to their interaction with numerous partners. Here, we show a novel method applicable in networks with directed edges (such as metabolic networks) that compensates for the low degree (non-hub) vertices in the network, and identifies important nodes, regardless of their hub properties. Our method computes the PageRank for the nodes of the network, and divides the PageRank by the in-degree (i.e., the number of incoming edges) of the node. This quotient is the same in all nodes in an undirected graph (even for large- and low-degree nodes, that is, for hubs and non-hubs as well), but may differ significantly from node to node in directed graphs. We suggest to assign importance to non-hub nodes with large PageRank\/in-degree quotient. Consequently, our method gives high scores to nodes with large PageRank, relative to their degrees: therefore non-hub important nodes can easily be identified in large networks. We demonstrate that these relatively high PageRank scores have biological relevance: the method correctly finds numerous already validated drug targets in distinct organisms (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Plasmodium falciparum and MRSA Staphylococcus aureus), and consequently, it may suggest new possible protein targets as well. Additionally, our scoring method was not chosen arbitrarily: its value for all nodes of all undirected graphs is constant; therefore its high value captures importance in the directed edge structure of the graph.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["D\u00e1niel B\u00e1nky","G\u00e1bor Iv\u00e1n","Vince Grolmusz"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0054204","first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T11:40:15+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1447408218,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0054204","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0054204","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23382878","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3558500\/pdf\/pone.0054204.pdf"],"pmcid":"PMC3558500","pmid":"23382878","pubdate":"2013-01-29T08:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e54204","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Equal Opportunity for Low-Degree Network Nodes: A PageRank-Based Method for Protein Target Identification in Metabolic Graphs","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/equal-opportunity-lowdegree-network-nodes-pagerankbased-method-protein-target-identification-metabol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6564711,"mean":6.0829954575298,"rank":1298835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5228353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6564711,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210989,"mean":8.663792651715,"rank":54095,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":156253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210989,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99814,"mean":9.8164172803143,"rank":27102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":72150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99814,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2839,"mean":10.575864693446,"rank":781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":2050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2839,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
