The 5-HT1A agonists, buspirone and 8-OH-DPAT, which lack affinity for 5-HT2A\/2C receptors, produced dose-related increases in punished responding. Of the compounds with a mixed binding profile, only WY 50,324 showed effects that were comparable to those observed after 8-OH-DPAT, whereas FG 5974 and CGS 18102A exhibited limited effects on punished responding, and LEK 8804 was ineffective. Administration of a relatively low, behaviorally active dose of ritanserin (0.16 mg\/kg) significantly enhanced the potency of 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone to increase punished responding from 8 to 50-fold without altering their effects on unpunished responding. Importantly, ritanserin failed to increase the number of doses of 8-OH-DPAT that significantly increased punished responding. In contrast, prazosin (2.5 mg\/kg) significantly enhanced the potency and increased the number of doses of buspirone exerting significant effects on punished responding, but did not alter the effects of 8-OH-DPAT. Taken together, the results neither explain the suggested greater efficacy in producing anxiolytic effects of compounds with putative mixed 5-HT1A agonist and 5-HT2A\/2C antagonist properties, nor confirm a proposed interaction between alpha1 adrenoreceptors and 5-HT1A agonists in preclinical tests of anxiolytic activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007de2","authors":["M S Kleven","W Koek"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T12:01:22+00:00","issns":["0022-3565"],"issue":"2","journal":"The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1268359641,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8632301"],"pmid":"8632301","pubdate":"1996-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Pharmacological characterization of in vivo properties of putative mixed 5-HT1A agonist\/5-HT2A\/2C antagonist anxiolytics.
