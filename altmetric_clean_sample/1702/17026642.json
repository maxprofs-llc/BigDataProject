The aim of the current investigation was to explore the construct of relationship-based anxiety and to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief couple-based psychoeducational session for this issue. Common behavioral patterns and cognitive tendencies seen among individuals with relationship-based anxiety were examined, including excessive reassurance-seeking, self-silencing, and partner accommodation. In the current investigation, a single psychoeducational session was developed to address these maladaptive interactive patterns of behavior specifically. The session was administered to a sample of 21 couples and was found to decrease levels of reassurance-seeking and self-silencing significantly among individuals with relationship anxiety, and to decrease levels of maladaptive accommodation behaviors significantly in their partners.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028ad","authors":["Paprocki, Christine M.","Baucom, Donald H."],"doi":"10.1111\/famp.12175","endpage":"58","first_seen_on":"2017-03-05T16:12:12+00:00","issns":["00147370","1545-5300"],"issue":"1","journal":"Family Process","last_mentioned_on":1488787443,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/famp.12175\/full?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/famp.12175\/pdf","pmid":"26303362","pubdate":"2015-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"45","subjects":["socialsciences","primaryhealthcare","psychology"],"title":"Worried About us: Evaluating an Intervention for Relationship-Based Anxiety","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/famp.12175","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/worried-about-evaluating-intervention-relationshipbased-anxiety"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":3728376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4497117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241736,"mean":13.726600508821,"rank":109084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":129137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241736,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":468,"mean":5.9618501070664,"rank":312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":468,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":35.697333333333,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
