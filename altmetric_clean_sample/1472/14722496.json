Here we report that a single atom of rhodium, a powerful noble metal catalyst, can promote the transfer of five oxygen atoms to oxidize carbon monoxide from a nine-atom rhodium-aluminum oxide cluster. This is a sharp improvement in the field of cluster science where the transfer of at most two oxygen atoms from a doped cluster is more commonly observed. Rhodium functions not only as the preferred trapping site to anchor and oxidize carbon monoxide by the oxygen atoms in direct connection with rhodium but also the primarily oxidative centre to accumulate the large amounts of electrons and the polarity of rhodium is ultimately transformed from positive to negative.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Xiao-Na Li","Hua-Min Zhang","Zhen Yuan","Sheng-Gui He"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms11404","first_seen_on":"2016-12-14T01:17:53+00:00","issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1481677894,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/ncomms11404"],"pmid":"27094921","pubdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"11404","subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"A nine-atom rhodium\u2013aluminum oxide cluster oxidizes five carbon monoxide molecules","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nineatom-rhodiumaluminum-oxide-cluster-oxidizes-five-carbon-monoxide-molecules"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7885400,"mean":6.6781117138083,"rank":1094060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6720218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7885400,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251632,"mean":12.356608120621,"rank":52562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":195561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251632,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12217,"mean":43.440297314997,"rank":6829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":5236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12217,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":795,"mean":62.292876574307,"rank":511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":795,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
