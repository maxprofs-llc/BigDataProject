The block can be removed and memory restored by intracerebral injections of water and by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections of several psychotropic drugs. The present experiments provide evidence that peptidyl-puromycin persists for long periods in subcellular fractions of synaptosomes (nerve endings), and that the peptide is lost from synaptosomal, but not from mitochondrial, fractions when memory is restored. These findings strengthen our interpretation of the mode of action of puromycin on memory.","ads_id":"1971PNAS...68...26F","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["L. B. Flexner","P.
