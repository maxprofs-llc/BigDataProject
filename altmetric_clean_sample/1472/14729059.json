The aim of the present experiments was to study cannabinoid effects on identified neurons in situ. Electrically-evoked postsynaptic currents and voltage-dependent calcium currents were investigated in the principal neurons of the corpus striatum, the medium spiny neurons, with the patch-clamp method for brain slices. These neurons were chosen because they produce messenger RNA for cannabinoid receptors and because the density of cannabinoid binding sites in the striatum is high. Activation of muscarinic receptors by carbachol (10(-5) M) reduced inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitude by 67%. The synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist R(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4- benzoxazin-yl]-(1-naphtalenyl)methanone (WIN55212-2; 10(-8) to 10(-5) M) dose-dependently reduced striatal inhibitory postsynaptic currents; the maximum effect, inhibition by 52%, was observed at 10(-6) M. Another cannabinoid agonist, (-)-cis-3-[2-hydroxy-4-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)phenyl]-trans-4-(3-hydr oxypropyl)cyclohexanol (CP55940; 10(-6) M), also reduced inhibitory postsynaptic currents, by 50%. The CB1 cannnabinoid receptor antagonist N-piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)4-methyl-3-pyra zolecarboxamide (SR141716A; 10(-6) M) had no effect when given alone but abolished the effect of WIN55212-2 (10(-6) M). WIN55212-2 (10(-6) M) did not change the current evoked by the GABA(A)-receptor agonist muscimol (10(-6) M). Activation of muscarinic receptors by carbachol (10(-5) M) inhibited voltage-dependent calcium currents by 21%, but the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55212-2 (10(-6) M) was without effect. The results show that activation of CB1 cannabinoid receptors reduces GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents in medium spiny neurons of the corpus striatum: the likely mechanism is presynaptic inhibition of GABA release from terminals of recurrent axons of the medium spiny neurons themselves.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031aa","authors":["Szabo, B","D\u00f6rner, L","Pfreundtner, C","N\u00f6renberg, W","Starke, K","B Szabo","L D\u00f6rner","C Pfreundtner","W N\u00f6renberg","K Starke"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0306-4522(97)00597-6","endpage":"403","first_seen_on":"2016-12-14T04:11:12+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0306-4522","03064522"],"issue":"2","journal":"Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":915148800,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0306-4522(97)00597-6"],"pmid":"9622239","pubdate":"1998-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"395","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Inhibition of GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents by cannabinoids in rat corpus striatum","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0306452297005976","volume":"85","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-gabaergic-inhibitory-postsynaptic-currents-cannabinoids-rat-corpus-striatum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6761414,"mean":6.1677007232053,"rank":1572416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4490814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6761414,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103904,"mean":10.866197280156,"rank":31114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":71675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103904,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2919,"mean":3.6475538039753,"rank":603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":1871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2919,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":2.01,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
