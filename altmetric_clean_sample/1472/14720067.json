The effects of various hydrothermal conditions (i.e., solution pH, hydrothermal time (HT) and HF concentration) on the growth of {001} faceted TiO2\/Ti film were investigated. The maximum photocatalytic performance of {001} faceted TiO2\/Ti film was observed when prepared at pH 2.62, HT of 3 h and at HF concentration of 0.02 M. The as-prepared {001} faceted TiO2\/Ti films were fully characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). More importantly, the as-prepared {001} faceted TiO2\/Ti film exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance toward degradation of norfloxacin in various water matrices (Milli-Q water, tap water, river water and synthetic wastewater). The individual influence of various anions (SO4(2-), HCO3(-), NO3(-), Cl(-)) and cations (K(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Cu(2+), Na(+), Fe(3+)) usually present in the real water samples on the photocatalytic performance of as-prepared TiO2\/Ti film with exposed {001} facet was investigated. The mechanistic studies revealed that (\u2022)OH is mainly involved in the photocatalytic degradation of norfloxacin by {001} faceted TiO2\/Ti film. In addition, norfloxacin degradation byproducts were investigated, on the basis of which degradation schemes were proposed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","authors":["Murtaza Sayed"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpca.6b09719","first_seen_on":"2016-12-13T23:46:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1089-5639","1520-5215"],"issue":"50","journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry A","last_mentioned_on":1481672225,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jpca.6b09719"],"pmid":"27959545","pubdate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atomic, Molecular, Nuclear, Particle And Plasma Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
