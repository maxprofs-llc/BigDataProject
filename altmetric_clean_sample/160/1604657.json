Transplantation of autologous corneal stem-cell sources is an alternative to allograft transplantation and does not require immunosuppression, but it is not possible in many cases in which bilateral disease produces total corneal stem-cell deficiency in both eyes. We studied the use of autologous oral mucosal epithelial cells as a source of cells for the reconstruction of the corneal surface.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50e3cf058f6100031c4","authors":["Nishida K","Yamato M","Hayashida Y","Watanabe K","Yamamoto K","Adachi E","Nagai S","Kikuchi A","Maeda N","Watanabe H","Okano T","Tano Y","Nishida, Kohji","Yamato, Masayuki","Hayashida, Yasutaka","Watanabe, Katsuhiko","Yamamoto, Kazuaki","Adachi, Eijiro","Nagai, Shigeru","Kikuchi, Akihiko","Maeda, Naoyuki","Watanabe, Hitoshi","Okano, Teruo","Tano, Yasuo"],"doi":"10.1056\/nejmoa040455","first_seen_on":"2013-07-04T19:29:37+00:00","issns":["0028-4793","1533-4406"],"issue":"12","journal":"New England Journal of Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1493567532,"links":["http:\/\/www.nejm.org\/doi\/full\/10.1056\/NEJMoa040455","http:\/\/www.nejm.org\/action\/showMediaPlayer?doi=10.1056%2FNEJMoa040455&aid=NEJMoa040455_attach_1&area=","http:\/\/www.nejm.org\/doi\/full\/10.1056\/NEJMoa040455#results"],"pmid":"15371576","pubdate":"2004-09-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":" Massachusetts Medical Society ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Corneal reconstruction with tissue-engineered cell sheets composed of autologous oral mucosal epithelium.","type":"article","volume":"351","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/corneal-reconstruction-tissueengineered-cell-sheets-composed-autologous-oral-mucosal-epithelium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154803,"mean":6.8922645386048,"rank":3850708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4123148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154803,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124812,"mean":7.0169357668797,"rank":49742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":71381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124812,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20099,"mean":47.628711513583,"rank":16424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":3481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20099,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":331,"mean":74.061654545455,"rank":258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":331,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":12,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":42,"Student  > Doctoral Student":15,"Student  > Ph.
