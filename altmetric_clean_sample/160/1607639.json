Ultrasonographic characteristics, such as an ill-defined margin, hypoechoicity or fine calcifications, are known to be associated with malignant thyroid lesions. The association between these characteristics and the risk of malignancy has been reported predominantly from series published where US is performed in radiology departments. Clinician-performed ultrasound (CPU) is increasingly being used as a modality, although there is little published literature validating this practice.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002360","authors":["Hamer, Peter W.","Aspinall, Sebastian R.","Malycha, Peter L.","Peter W.
