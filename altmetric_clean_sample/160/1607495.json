For this reason, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are currently undergoing large-scale, long-term randomized trials specifically designed for cardiovascular outcomes. Aim of the present meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials is the assessment of the effects of GLP-1 RA on major cardiovascular events (MACE), mortality and cardiovascular risk factors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026fc","authors":["Monami, M.","Dicembrini, I.","Nardini, C.","Fiordelli, I.","Mannucci, E.","Monami, Matteo","Dicembrini, Ilaria","Nardini, Camilla","Fiordelli, Irene","Mannucci, Edoardo"],"doi":"10.1111\/dom.12175","endpage":"47","first_seen_on":"2013-07-06T08:48:20+00:00","issns":["1463-1326","1462-8902"],"issue":"1","journal":"Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1408983420,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/dom.12175\/abstract;jsessionid=204D3D0728FF1E2768CF88B5BB902BC1.d02t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/dom.12175\/pdf","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/dom.12175","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/dom.12175\/abstract;jsessionid=B1544F7EF725DC92A8B2E4EDD2EBE12D.d03t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/dom.12175\/abstract;jsessionid=0FA3F7241C3EEA87C331C6D8B991DB14.d03t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/dom.12175\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/dom.12175\/pdf","pmid":"23829656","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"38","subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Effects of glucagon\u2010like peptide\u20101 receptor agonists on cardiovascular risk: a meta\u2010analysis of randomized clinical trials","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-glucagonlike-peptide1-receptor-agonists-cardiovascular-risk-metaanalysis-randomized-clinical-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7665691,"mean":6.5843947485438,"rank":1863257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4782176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7665691,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122796,"mean":6.8276832444319,"rank":30993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":87343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122796,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1155,"mean":6.4091923743501,"rank":369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1155,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
