We compare consultation to two benchmark treatments: one with isolated individual choices, and a second with group choice after communication. Our benchmark treatments replicate findings that groups take more risk than individuals in the investment task; content analysis of group discussions reveals that higher risk-taking in groups is positively correlated with mentions of expected value. In our consultation treatments, we find evidence of peer effects: decisions within the peer group are significantly correlated. However, average risk-taking after consultation is not significantly different from isolated individual choices. We also find that risk-taking after consultation is not affected by adding a feedback stage in which subjects see the choices of their consultation peers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d64","authors":["Spiros Bougheas","Jeroen Nieboer","Martin Sefton"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jebo.2013.06.010","first_seen_on":"2013-07-04T13:25:31+00:00","issns":["01672681"],"journal":"Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization","last_mentioned_on":1374673217,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0167268113001625"],"pmid":"24926111","pubdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Business, Management and Accounting","Economics, Econometrics and Finance"],"title":"Risk-taking in social settings: Group and peer effects","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risktaking-social-settings-group-peer-effects"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4509149,"mean":5.2377591184699,"rank":1635849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2856440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4509149,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89143,"mean":7.5525021426489,"rank":27307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":61434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89143,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":508,"mean":6.6813451676529,"rank":233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":508,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":24.225578947368,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
