Two theorems based on covariance between processing time and production lead time are formulated and proved theoretically. Theorem 1 links the average production lead time to the \"processing time weighted production lead time\" for the multi-stage production systems analytically. The influence of different dispatching rules on average lead time, which is well known from simulation and empirical studies, can be proved theoretically in Theorem 2 for a single stage production system. A simulation study is conducted to gain more insight into the influence of dispatching rules on average production lead time in a multi-stage production system. We find that the \"processing time weighted average production lead time\" for a multi-stage production system is not invariant of the applied dispatching rule and can be used as a dispatching rule independent indicator for single-stage production systems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5713cf058f610004c37","authors":["Alexander H\u00fcbl","Herbert Jodlbauer","Klaus Altendorfer"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijpe.2013.03.020","endpage":"484","first_seen_on":"2013-07-05T16:48:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09255273","0925-5273"],"issue":"2","journal":"International Journal of Production Economics","last_mentioned_on":1370603832,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ijpe.2013.03.020","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0925527313001369"],"pmcid":"PMC5356510","pmid":"28344393","pubdate":"2013-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Decision Sciences","Business, Management and Accounting","Social Sciences","Engineering","Economics, Econometrics and Finance","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"479","title":"Influence of dispatching rules on average production lead time for multi-stage production systems","type":"article","volume":"144","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-dispatching-rules-average-production-lead-time-multistage-production-systems"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6737609,"mean":6.161440818461,"rank":5757851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6737609,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119240,"mean":6.6848306678185,"rank":96329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119240,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247,"mean":2.4833495934959,"rank":205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
