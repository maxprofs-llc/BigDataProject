Four young boys (ages 4-5 years) diagnosed with autism participated. The children were participants in an early intensive behavioural intervention clinic and during downtimes stood on a whole body vibration platform with the machine turned off (control condition) and on (treatment condition) for three to four, 30 s periods (frequency=28 Hz; amplitude 0.97 mm). The outcome measure was frequency of stereotypic behaviour, which was evaluated for 5 min before and after standing on the vibration platform. The results revealed that whole body vibration was not able to uniformly decrease the rates of all types of stereotypy; that is, some stereotypy decreased while others were unchanged. Subjectively, the children enjoyed whole body vibration which was easy to integrate into the behavioural programme.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc98","authors":["Eadric Bressel","Mandi W Gibbons","Andrew Samaha"],"doi":"10.1136\/bcr.02.2011.3834","first_seen_on":"2013-07-06T21:31:31+00:00","issns":["1757-790X"],"journal":"BMJ Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1373146279,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3082064\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3082064","pmid":"22696626","pubdate":"2013-07-06T20:11:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Group","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Novel treatment (new drug\/intervention; established drug\/procedure in new situation): Effect of whole body vibration on stereotypy of young children with autism","type":"article","volume":"2011","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-whole-body-vibration-stereotypy-young-children-autism-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2921395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1436604,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89127,"mean":7.4784502614278,"rank":57671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":28263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89127,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2076,"mean":2.9554139759036,"rank":1094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":929,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2076,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":3.71026,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
