However, due to the relatively short half-life of the molecule (approximately 8 hours), frequent dosing may be required to achieve required hemoglobin levels. Therefore, a need was identified in some anemic patient populations for erythropoiesis stimulating agents with longer half-lives that required less frequent dosing. This need led to the development of second generation molecules which are modified versions of rHuEPO with improved pharma-cokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties such as darbepoetin alfa, a hyperglycosylated analog of rHuEPO, and pegzyrepoetin, a pegylated rHuEPO. Third generation molecules, such as peginesatide, which are peptide mimetics that have no sequence homology to rHuEPO have also recently been developed. The various molecular, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic properties of these and other erythropoiesis stimulating agents will be discussed in this review.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c6a","authors":["Angus Sinclair"],"doi":"10.2147\/btt.s45971","first_seen_on":"2013-07-03T01:53:56+00:00","issns":["1177-5475"],"journal":"Biologics: Targets & Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1372816350,"links":["http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-approaches-to-modulate-activity-peer-reviewed-article-BTT"],"pmid":"23847411","pubdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"161","title":"Erythropoiesis stimulating agents approaches to modulate activity","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-approaches-modulate-activity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3558437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89351,"mean":7.4417262451037,"rank":72086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89351,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":1.8534336283186,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.125,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
