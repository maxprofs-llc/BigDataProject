Chi possesses multiple groups, which can be used both for Chi derivatization and for particle formation. The aim of this work was to produce stable nanosized range Chi gels (nanogels, NGs) with different charge and to study the driving forces of complex formation between Chi NGs and proteins or peptides. Positively charged NGs of 150 nm in diameter were prepared from hexanoyl chitosan (HC) by the ionotropic gelation method while negatively charged NGs of 190 nm were obtained from succinoyl Chi (SC) by a Ca\u00b2\u207a coacervation approach. NGs were loaded with a panel of proteins or peptides with different weights and charges. We show that NGs preferentially formed complexes with oppositely charged molecules, especially peptides, as was demonstrated by gel-electrophoresis, confocal microscopy and HPLC. Complex formation was accompanied by a change in zeta-potential and decrease in size. We concluded that complex formation between Chi NGs and peptide\/proteins is mediated mostly by electrostatic interactions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Anastasia Zubareva","Alla Ilyina","Aleksander Prokhorov","Denis Kurek","Mikhail Efremov","Valery Varlamov","Sevda Senel","Pavel Ignatyev","\u0415lena Svirshchevskaya"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules18077848","first_seen_on":"2013-07-06T03:25:41+00:00","issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"7","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1373081134,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23823877?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/molecules18077848"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/18\/7\/7848\/pdf","pmid":"23823877","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Characterization of Protein and Peptide Binding to Nanogels Formed by Differently Charged Chitosan Derivatives.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/18\/7\/7848\/","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-protein-peptide-binding-nanogels-formed-differently-charged-chitosan-derivatives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":3111505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1004103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89124,"mean":7.4521830503911,"rank":61731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":17981,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89124,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1532,"mean":1.4554918354017,"rank":478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":907,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1532,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.5681818181818,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
