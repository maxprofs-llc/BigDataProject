Perinatal pathology has significant public health-related utility and should be championing its service by providing maternal and fetal\/infant mortality and morbidity data to governmental health ministries. It is with this pathologic data that informed decisions can be made on health-related courses of action and allocation of resources. These perinatal pathology data are needed to develop appropriate public health initiatives, specifically toward achieving the Millennium Developmental Goals as the best way to effectively decrease infant and maternal deaths and to determine causes of perinatal mortality and morbidity. The following overview will focus on the utility of perinatal pathology specifically as related to its public health function and will suggest methods to improve its service in resource-poor settings. This article is offered not as a critique of the current practice that most pathologists find themselves working in globally, but to provide suggestions for improving perinatal pathology services, which could be implemented with the limited available resources and manpower most pathology departments currently have. In addition, we offer suggestions for graded improvements (\"ramping up\") over time.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000230c","authors":["Roberts, Drucilla J"],"doi":"10.5858\/arpa.2011-0560-sa","first_seen_on":"2013-07-05T13:35:50+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1543-2165"],"issue":"6","journal":"Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1373031350,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23721272","http:\/\/www.archivesofpathology.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.5858\/arpa.2011-0560-SA"],"pmid":"23721272","pubdate":"2013-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Perinatal pathology: practice suggestions for limited-resource settings.","type":"article","volume":"137","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/perinatal-pathology-practice-suggestions-limitedresource-settings"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633792,"mean":4.9212574058383,"rank":1449046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2140037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633792,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84812,"mean":7.2742648477204,"rank":27973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":55681,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84812,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":471,"mean":2.5763744680851,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":471,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":1.8421875,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
