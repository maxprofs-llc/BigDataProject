Recent data have shown that in addition to these well-known interaction partners, Dlg1 may also recruit components of the vesicle trafficking machinery either to the plasma membrane or to transport vesicles. Here, we discuss Dlg1 function in vesicle formation, targeting, tethering and fusion, in both the exocytotic and endocytotic pathways. These pathways contribute to cell functions as major and diverse as glutamatergic activity in the neurons, membrane homeostasis in Schwann cell myelination, insulin stimulation of glucose transport in adipocytes, or endothelial secretion of the hemostatic protein, von Willebrand factor (VWF).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000367f","authors":["Walch, Laurence"],"doi":"10.1111\/tra.12089","endpage":"973","first_seen_on":"2013-07-06T14:24:55+00:00","issns":["1600-0854","1398-9219"],"issue":"9","journal":"Traffic","last_mentioned_on":1373120687,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/tra.12089\/abstract;jsessionid=8AB2D645CA827F8D2CF05A22697208B7.d03t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/tra.12089\/pdf","pmid":"23829493","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons A\/S","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"964","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Emerging role of the scaffolding protein Dlg1 in interfacing with the vesicle trafficking machinery","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emerging-role-scaffolding-protein-dlg1-vesicle-trafficking"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6289149,"mean":5.9799639738173,"rank":2957033,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1880829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6289149,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99564,"mean":7.5603013971054,"rank":49165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":36654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99564,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":514,"mean":1.9659454191033,"rank":237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":514,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
