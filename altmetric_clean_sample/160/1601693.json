It has been suggested that high concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) in women contribute to increased A\u03b2 generation after menopause, but the mechanism for this is incompletely understood. We investigated the effect of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), an LH receptor agonist, on APP \u03b2-cleavage in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. Treatment of these cells with hCG-induced elevated \u03b2-cleavage in a dose-dependent manner: administration of 30 mIU but not 10 mIU\/ml of hCG significantly increased sAPP\u03b2 levels in the cell medium 1.7-fold as measured by ELISA. These results support the notion that LH contributes to elevated A\u03b2 levels at least in part by increasing \u03b2-cleavage of APP by \u03b2-site APP cleaving enzyme.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c8","authors":["Saberi S","Du YP","Christie M","Goldsbury C"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10571-013-9954-3","endpage":"751","first_seen_on":"2013-07-03T15:56:18+00:00","issns":["1573-6830","0272-4340"],"issue":"6","journal":"Cellular & Molecular Neurobiology","last_mentioned_on":1372866967,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23812658"],"pmid":"23812658","pubdate":"2013-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"747","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","neurology"],"title":"Human Chorionic Gonadotropin Increases \u03b2-Cleavage of Amyloid Precursor Protein in SH-SY5Y Cells.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-chorionic-gonadotropin-increases-cleavage-amyloid-precursor-protein-shsy5y-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629910,"mean":4.9315517540573,"rank":2015747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940930,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629910,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84983,"mean":7.2645644254079,"rank":44421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":23399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84983,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193,"mean":1.87509375,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
