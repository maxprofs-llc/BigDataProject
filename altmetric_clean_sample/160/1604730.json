In the Netherlands, it is recommended that prehospital advanced life support is particularly provided by a physician-based helicopter emergency medical service (P-HEMS) in addition to paramedic care (EMS). Previous studies have however shown that a substantial part of severe TBI patients is exclusively treated by an EMS team. In order to better understand this phenomenon, we evaluated P-HEMS deployment characteristics in severe TBI in a multicenter setting.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ade","authors":["Franschman G","Andriessen TM","Boer C","Van der Naalt J","Horn J","Haitsma I","Vos PE","G.
