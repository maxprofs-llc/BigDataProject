By expressing three different fungal pathways in two S. cerevisiae hosts respectively, we found that the xylose utilization efficiency by recombinant S. cerevisiae depends not only on the choice of xylose pathway but also on the choice of host, exhibiting an obvious host or context dependence. To investigate molecular mechanisms of this context dependence, we applied RNA-seq analysis in this study for a systematic characterization of the xylose utilization via different pathways in different S. cerevisiae hosts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007e9","doi":"10.1186\/1754-6834-6-96","first_seen_on":"2013-07-06T00:12:56+00:00","issns":["1754-6834"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biotechnology for Biofuels","last_mentioned_on":1373069571,"links":["http:\/\/www.biotechnologyforbiofuels.com\/content\/6\/1\/96\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biotechnologyforbiofuels.com\/content\/pdf\/1754-6834-6-96.pdf","pmid":"23830104","pubdate":"2013-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Engineering\/Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Breeding\/Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Renewable and Green Energy","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Energy","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"96","title":"Investigating host dependence of xylose utilization in recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains using RNA-seq analysis","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/investigating-host-dependence-xylose-utilization-recombinant-saccharomyces-cerevisiae-strains-using-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627324,"mean":4.9493148749129,"rank":2906479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627324,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84608,"mean":7.3154618175802,"rank":67482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84608,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247,"mean":4.3002845528455,"rank":204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":5.159,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
