The national pharmaceutical policy of China has multiple objectives: to develop the domestic pharmaceutical industry and encourage innovation, to control escalation of total pharmaceutical expenditures (TPE) which constitute a substantial component of total health expenditures (THE), and to ensure access to essential medicines for poor and uninsured patients. The current pharmaceutical system has been criticized for its high costs, questionable prescribing practices, and poor regulation of drug quality. This study aims to examine the time trends and influential factors of TPE in China.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032dc","authors":["Shi L","Yang HY","Cheng G","Meng Q","Lizheng Shi","Heidi Y.
