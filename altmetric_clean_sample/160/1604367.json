A total of 57 feet in 36 patients (mean age 6.8 years (2 to 16)) were treated with this new technique, which transfers the distal part of the duplicated fourth metatarsal to the proximal part of the fifth metatarsal. Clinical and radiological assessments were undertaken pre- and post-operatively and any complications were recorded. Final outcomes were evaluated according to the methods described by Phelps and Grogan. Forefoot width was reduced and the lengths of the all reconstructed toes were maintained after surgery. Union was achieved for all the metatarsal osteotomies without any angular deformities. Outcomes at the final assessment were excellent in 51 feet (89%) and good in six (11%). This newly described surgical technique provides for painless, comfortable shoe-wearing after a single, easy-to-perform operation with good clinical, radiological and functional outcomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059fd","authors":["O.
