To further understand the mechanisms of alpha rhythm power fluctuation, we performed simultaneous EEGs and functional magnetic resonance imaging recordings in human subjects during a resting state and explored the dynamic relationship between alpha power fluctuation and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals of the brain. Based on the frequency characteristics of the alpha power time series (APTS) during 20-minute EEG recordings, we divided the APTS into two components: fast fluctuation (0.04-0.167 Hz) and slow fluctuation (0-0.04 Hz). Analysis of the correlation between the MRI signal and each component revealed that the slow fluctuation component of alpha power was positively correlated with BOLD signal changes in the brain stem and the medial part of the thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex, while the fast fluctuation component was correlated with the lateral part of the thalamus and the anterior cingulate cortex, but not the brain stem. In summary, these data suggest that different subcortical structures contribute to slow and fast modulations of alpha spectra on brain EEG.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0066869","first_seen_on":"2013-07-05T16:36:34+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1373206477,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23824708?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23824708","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Spontaneous Slow Fluctuation of EEG Alpha Rhythm Reflects Activity in Deep-Brain Structures: A Simultaneous EEG-fMRI Study.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spontaneous-slow-fluctuation-eeg-alpha-rhythm-reflects-activity-deepbrain-structures-simultaneous-ee"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":1240181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3793057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93531,"mean":7.5758946434301,"rank":25896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":67550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93531,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88911,"mean":9.2651301540885,"rank":27869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":61017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88911,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3758,"mean":12.489861059356,"rank":1247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3758,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
