Recent studies of tumour dynamics indicate that gene expression in solid tumours would depend on the distance from the centre of the tumour. Since tumour proliferative activity is mainly localised to its external zone, and taking into account that generation and expansion of genetic mutations depend on the number of cell divisions, important differences in gene expression between central and peripheral sections of the same tumour are to be expected. Here, we have studied variations in the genetic expression profile between peripheral and internal samples of the same brain tumour. We have carried out microarray analysis of mRNA expression, and found a differential profile of genetic expression between the two cell subsets. In particular, one major nuclear protein that regulates cell responses to DNA-damaging and stress signals, GADD45alpha, was expressed at much lower levels in the peripheral zone, as compared to tumour core samples. These differences in GADD45alpha mRNA transcription levels have been confirmed by quantitative analysis via real time PCR, and protein levels of GADD45alpha also exhibit the same pattern of differential expression. Our findings suggest that GADD45alpha might play a major role in the regulation of brain tumour invasive potential.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f61000812e","authors":["Antonio Br\u00fa","Carlos del Fresno","Alessandra Soares-Schanoski","Sonia Albertos","Isabel Br\u00fa","Amelia Porres","Eduardo Roll\u00e1n-Landeras","Ana Dopazo","David Casero","Vanesa G\u00f3mez-Pi\u00f1a","Lourdes Garc\u00eda","Francisco Arnalich","Rebeca Alvarez","Alexandro Rodr\u00edguez-Rojas","Pablo Fuentes-Prior","Eduardo L\u00f3pez-Collazo"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T03:02:51+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1357-0560"],"issue":"4","journal":"Medical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1286733726,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17917095"],"pmid":"17917095","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Position-dependent expression of GADD45alpha in rat brain tumours.","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/positiondependent-expression-gadd45alpha-rat-brain-tumours"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630815,"mean":4.9285062716012,"rank":816193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630815,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95690,"mean":8.2519593892717,"rank":24963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95690,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":325,"mean":1.4233271604938,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":325,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":1.0527027027027,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Antonio Br\u00fa","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=389918266#altmetric_citation_9","license":"public","citation_ids":[3571251,3571255],"posted_on":"2010-10-10T18:02:06+00:00","summary":"Antonio Br\u00fa Espino (born 1962) is Theoretical physicist and permanent professor in the Departament of Applied Mathematics at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=17854316","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"85.85.65.54","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/85.85.65.54"}}]}}
