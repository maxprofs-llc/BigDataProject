Imiquimod, a member of this drug family, is currently used as first line topical therapy for genital condyloma. It recently showed clinical efficacy against several benign and malignant skin lesions, including actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma. Working primarily through the stimulation of a proinflammatory immune response, the mechanism of action of imiquimod may be similar to that through which bacillus Calmette-Guerin is thought to act. We hypothesized that imidazoquinolines have therapeutic potential against bladder cancer. We determined the in vitro and in vivo effects of imidazoquinolines against bladder cancer cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f12","doi":"10.1016\/j.juro.2007.01.112","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T05:14:11+00:00","issns":["0022-5347"],"journal":"The Journal of Urology","last_mentioned_on":1254145012,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.juro.2007.01.112","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17509356"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S0022534707002509\/pdf","pmid":"17509356","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Antitumor effects of imidazoquinolines in urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antitumor-effects-imidazoquinolines-urothelial-cell-carcinoma-bladder"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616992,"mean":4.9289391557822,"rank":815297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2278012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616992,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93262,"mean":7.2413530843547,"rank":23670,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68516,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93262,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4230,"mean":2.5721759281154,"rank":706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":3020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4230,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.7240740740741,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
