The method is flexible and scalable as the geometry and the size of the recirculation zone is defined by pressure, channel number, and geometry. The pipette is capable of carrying out a variety of complex fluid processing operations, such as mixing, multiplexing, or gradient generation at selected cells in cell and tissue cultures. Using an uptake assay, we show that it is possible to generate dose-response curves in situ from adherent Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing proton-activated human transient receptor potential vanilloid (hTRPV1) receptors. Using confined superfusion and cell stimulation, we could activate hTRPV1 receptors in single cells, measure the response by a patch-clamp pipette, and induce membrane bleb formation by exposing selected groups of cells to formaldehyde\/dithiothreitol-containing solutions, respectively. In short, the microfluidic pipette allows for complex, contamination-free multiple-compound delivery for pharmacological screening of intact adherent cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","doi":"10.1021\/ac100480f","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T05:15:33+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1457049058,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/ac100480f"],"pmid":"20443547","pubdate":"2010-05-06T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"A microfluidic pipette for single-cell pharmacology.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microfluidic-pipette-singlecell-pharmacology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7346659,"mean":6.3824921979455,"rank":1753383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4616855,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7346659,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236721,"mean":8.148666289287,"rank":66853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":165673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236721,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7094,"mean":3.3497476385168,"rank":933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4709,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7094,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":298,"mean":2.5686464646465,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":298,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":29,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
