A systematic examination of the primary references of these entries has led to a collection of binding affinity data (K(d), K(i), and IC(50)) for a total of 1359 complexes. The outcomes of this project have been organized into a Web-accessible database named the PDBbind database.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Renxiao Wang,"],"doi":"10.1021\/jm030580l","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T03:54:41+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1307984191,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/jm030580l","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15163179"],"pmid":"15163179","pubdate":"2004-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"The PDBbind database: collection of binding affinities for protein-ligand complexes with known three-dimensional structures.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pdbbind-database-collection-binding-affinities-proteinligand-complexes-known-threedimensional-struct"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628302,"mean":4.942517914036,"rank":817169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288081,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628302,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95159,"mean":8.2065848588665,"rank":24735,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95159,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2707,"mean":3.4120761271249,"rank":543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2707,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":3.1007222222222,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":61,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Student  > Ph.
