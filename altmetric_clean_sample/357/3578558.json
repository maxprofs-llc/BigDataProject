In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the catalytic subunits (alpha and alpha') are encoded by the CKA1, CKA2 genes. cka1Deltacka2(ts) mutants arrest cell cycle in both G1 and G2\/M at 37 degrees C. Hence, it has been proposed that CK2 plays an important role in cell-cycle progression and several cell-cycle proteins have been reported to be CK2 substrates. We have previously shown that Sic1, the inhibitor of Clb5-Cdc28 complexes required for the G1\/S transition, is a physiologically relevant CK2 substrate. Here we show that CK2 inactivation up-regulates Sic1 level resulting in severe down-regulation of Clb5-Cdc28 kinase activity. Concurrent inactivation of Sic1 and CK2 leads to accumulation of cells with a post-synthetic DNA content and short\/elongated spindles, typical of cells arrested in mitosis. These findings indicate that Sic1 plays a major role during G1 arrest of CK2-inactivated cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2007.05.195","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T05:56:42+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1217772737,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bbrc.2007.05.195","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17574209"],"pmid":"17574209","pubdate":"2007-10-07T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"In CK2 inactivated cells the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1 is involved in cell-cycle arrest before the onset of S phase.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ck2-inactivated-cells-cyclin-dependent-kinase-inhibitor-sic1-involved-cellcycle-arrest-before-onset"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4127946,"mean":5.1089039524084,"rank":961384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2604175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4127946,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133730,"mean":9.19111248869,"rank":41401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":90453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133730,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7126,"mean":2.2447910175439,"rank":283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":2843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7126,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196,"mean":2.2822871794872,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
