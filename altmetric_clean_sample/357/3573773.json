Participants reported how others evaluated their math and verbal ability and how they viewed their own ability when their gender or ethnicity was salient. Asian American women (Experiment 1) and European Americans (Experiment 2) exhibited knowledge of stereotyped social expectancies and corresponding self-stereotyping associated with their more salient identity. African Americans (Experiment 3) exhibited some knowledge of stereotyped social expectancies but no corresponding self-stereotyping. Correlational evidence and a 4th experiment suggest that self-stereotyping is mediated by the degree to which close others are perceived to endorse stereotypes as applicable to the self.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037a6","doi":"10.1037\/0022-3514.90.4.529","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T04:04:30+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Personality & Social Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1479905384,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1037\/0022-3514.90.4.529"],"pmid":"16649853","pubdate":"2006-05-03T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Marketing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Self-stereotyping in the context of multiple social identities.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selfstereotyping-context-multiple-social-identities"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7729992,"mean":6.6289680453638,"rank":1884765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4817225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7729992,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240017,"mean":8.2310462885808,"rank":68261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":166893,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240017,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5793,"mean":9.4532230662983,"rank":2196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5793,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":21.17135,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":18,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Ph.
