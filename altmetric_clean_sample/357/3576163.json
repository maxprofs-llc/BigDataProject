Classical chicken embryology has provided fate maps and elucidated the cell-cell interactions that specify limb pattern. The first defined chemical that can mimic one of these interactions was discovered by experiments on developing chick limbs and, over the last 15 years or so, the role of an increasing number of developmentally important genes has been uncovered. The principles that underlie limb development in chickens are applicable to other vertebrates and there are growing links with clinical genetics. The sequence of the chicken genome, together with other recently assembled chicken genomic resources, will present new opportunities for exploiting the ease of manipulating the limb.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f610003088","doi":"10.1016\/j.mod.2004.05.015","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T05:01:11+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Mechanisms of Development","last_mentioned_on":1216942995,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.mod.2004.05.015","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15296968"],"pmid":"15296968","pubdate":"2004-08-06T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["embryology","cellbiology"],"title":"The contribution of chicken embryology to the understanding of vertebrate limb development.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contribution-chicken-embryology-understanding-vertebrate-limb-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627970,"mean":4.9447382433571,"rank":817342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627970,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95079,"mean":8.1877048949285,"rank":24695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95079,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":425,"mean":2.1601839622642,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":425,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
