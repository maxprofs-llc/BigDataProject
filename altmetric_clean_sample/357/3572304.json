Most 1,4-BZs like diazepam recognize all GABA(A)\/BZ receptors containing the alpha1-3 or alpha5 together with any beta and the gamma2 subunit. Other compounds differentiate less, e.g. Ro15-4513, that additionally recognizes alpha4- and a6-containing receptors, or differentiate more, e.g. zolpidem, that recognizes preferentially alpha1-containing receptors. Here we describe the functional properties of 1-(4-chloro-phenyl)-4-piperidin-1-yl-1,5-dihydro-imidazol-2-on (ELB139) in the presence and absence of the BZ receptor antagonist flumazenil (Ro15-1788) on recombinant alphaibeta2gamma2 (i=1-5) receptor subtypes expressed in HEK 293 cells. The properties were measured with the whole-cell variation of the patch-clamp technique and compared to those of diazepam. Like the latter, ELB139 did not potentiate GABA-induced currents in alpha4-containing receptors, but it displays functional subtype specificity between alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, and alpha5beta2gamma2 receptors with highest potency in alpha3-containing receptors but highest efficacy in alpha1- or alpha2-containing receptors, respectively. ELB139 acted as a partial agonist on these receptor subtypes reaching 40-50% of the efficacy of diazepam.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a0","doi":"10.1016\/j.neuropharm.2006.09.013","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T03:26:58+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Neuropharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1291246747,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.neuropharm.2006.09.013","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17087982"],"pmid":"17087982","pubdate":"2006-11-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology","pharmacology"],"title":"The novel anxiolytic ELB139 displays selectivity to recombinant GABA(A) receptors different from diazepam.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-anxiolytic-elb139-displays-selectivity-recombinant-gabaa-receptors-different-diazepam"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629910,"mean":4.9315517540573,"rank":816273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629910,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95476,"mean":8.2345781618227,"rank":24858,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95476,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1174,"mean":3.0505507246377,"rank":155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1174,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":3.1071176470588,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"DK":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"ELB-139","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=400017098#altmetric_citation_2","license":"public","citation_ids":[3572304],"posted_on":"2010-12-01T23:39:07+00:00","summary":"ELB-139 (LS-191,811) is an anxiolytic drug with a novel chemical structure, which is used in scientific research.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=18766868","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Rjwilmsi","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Rjwilmsi"}}]}}
