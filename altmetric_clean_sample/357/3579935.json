In animals and plants, the proteins form an enzyme complex loosely associating with the mitochondrial inner membrane. In the enzymatic reaction, H-protein converts P-protein, which is by itself a potential alpha-amino acid decarboxylase, to an active enzyme, and also forms a complex with T-protein. In both glycine cleavage and synthesis, aminomethyl moiety bound to lipoic acid of H-protein represents the intermediate that is degraded to or can be formed from N(5),N(10)-methylene-H(4)folate and ammonia by the action of T-protein. N(5),N(10)-Methylene-H(4)folate is used for the biosynthesis of various cellular substances such as purines, thymidylate and methionine that is the major methyl group donor through S-adenosyl-methionine. This accounts for the physiological importance of the glycine cleavage system as the most prominent pathway in serine and glycine catabolism in various vertebrates including humans. Nonketotic hyperglycinemia, a congenital metabolic disorder in human infants, results from defective glycine cleavage activity. The majority of patients with nonketotic hyperglycinemia had lesions in the P-protein gene, whereas some had mutant T-protein genes. The only patient classified into the degenerative type of nonketotic hyperglycinemia had an H-protein devoid of the prosthetic lipoyl residue. The crystallography of normal T-protein as well as biochemical characterization of recombinants of the normal and mutant T-proteins confirmed why the mutant T-proteins had lost enzyme activity. Putative mechanisms of cellular injuries including those in the central nervous system of patients with nonketotic hyperglycinemia are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008604","authors":["Goro Kikuchi","Yutaro Motokawa","Tadashi Yoshida","Koichi Hiraga"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T06:33:14+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1349-2896"],"issue":"7","journal":"Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Series B: Physical and Biological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1448403627,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18941301"],"pmcid":"PMC3666648","pmid":"18941301","pubdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["biology","physiology"],"title":"Glycine cleavage system: reaction mechanism, physiological significance, and hyperglycinemia.","type":"article","volume":"84","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glycine-cleavage-system-reaction-mechanism-physiological-significance-hyperglycinemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6602221,"mean":6.1274999121509,"rank":1532297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":4431754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6602221,"percentile":67},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210432,"mean":8.6564835029061,"rank":62731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":144614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210432,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":29.612019417476,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":74.166666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":27,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
