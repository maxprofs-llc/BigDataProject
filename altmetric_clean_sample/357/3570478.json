Such problems include fetal alcohol syndrome, which is first manifested in infancy; emotional problems and hyperactivity in childhood; emotional problems and conduct problems in adolescence; and the development of alcoholism in adulthood. Although much has been learned over the ensuing two decades, a number of controversial research areas remain. In particular, debate stems from the fact that despite a common interest in COA's, clinically focused literature and research-focused literature have resulted in two distinct bodies of knowledge. This article reviews important research results, with emphasis on findings generated by the alcohol-research community. Attention also is given to examining the empirical validity of concepts that have been advanced by several influential clinicians from the COA field.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021c8","authors":["K J Sher"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T02:44:41+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0090-838X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Alcohol Health & Research World","last_mentioned_on":1216507192,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15706777"],"pmid":"15706777","pubdate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Psychological characteristics of children of alcoholics.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/psychological-characteristics-children-alcoholics-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3624912,"mean":4.9343443616567,"rank":816580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2284730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3624912,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94351,"mean":7.5644620667727,"rank":24080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":69192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94351,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.5769230769231,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
