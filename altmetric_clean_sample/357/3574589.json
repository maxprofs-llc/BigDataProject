Thirty-seven (95%) subjects responded satisfactorily. No relapses or persistent faecal excretion of salmonellae were seen in the 29 patients followed up for 2 to 19 weeks. The treatment was well tolerated, no side-effects being recorded. In vitro studies revealed a synergistic interaction between mecillinam and ampicillin against isolates of Salmonella paratyphi A.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f61000597d","authors":["D Tanphaichitra","S Srimuang","P Chiaprasittigul","P Menday","O E Christensen"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T04:26:10+00:00","issns":["0300-8126"],"issue":"6","journal":"Infection","last_mentioned_on":1246274497,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6569851"],"pmid":"6569851","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"The combination of pivmecillinam and pivampicillin in the treatment of enteric fever.","type":"article","volume":"12"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4828923,"mean":5.7619065518173,"rank":1175846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3061894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4828923,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173749,"mean":8.8018647006011,"rank":51570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":119904,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173749,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":333,"mean":2.2187228915663,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":202,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":333,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":2.6869473684211,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Pivmecillinam","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=299291526#altmetric_citation_8","license":"public","citation_ids":[3574588,3574589],"posted_on":"2009-06-29T11:21:37+00:00","summary":"Pivmecillinam (INN) or amdinocillin pivoxil (USAN, trade names Selexid, Penomax and Coactabs) is an orally active prodrug of mecillinam, an extended-spectrum penicillin antibiotic.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=19124947","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Anypodetos","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Anypodetos"}}]}}
