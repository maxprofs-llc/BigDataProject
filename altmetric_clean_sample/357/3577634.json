The enzyme hydrolyzed various phosphodiester and pyrophosphate bonds, including p-nitrophenyl thymidine 5'-phosphate, p-nitrophenyl thymidine 3'-phosphate, cyclic nucleotides, ATP, NAD+, inorganic pyrophosphate, dinucleotides, and poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose), which is a polymer synthesized from NAD+. However, it did not hydrolyze highly polymerized polynucleotides. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated as 270 000 to 280 000 by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 and Bio-Gel A-5m. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the enzyme was composed of subunits with molecular weights calculated to be 75 000. The enzyme did not require divalent cations for activity being fully active in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The pH optimum for the enzyme was approximately 6 with p-ni-trophenyl thymidine 5'-phosphate or adenosine cyclic 3',5'monophosphate, and 5.3 with NAD+. Double reciprocal plots of the initial velocity against the concentration of p-nitrophenyl thymidine 5'-phosphate gave two apparent Km values of 0.17 and 1.3 mM, suggesting the presence of at least two active sites.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["H Shinshi","M Miwa","K Kato","M Noguchi","T Matsushima","T Sugimura"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T05:32:47+00:00","issns":["0006-2960"],"issue":"10","journal":"Biochemistry (00062979)","last_mentioned_on":1340688799,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6041"],"pmid":"6041","pubdate":"1976-05-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"A novel phosphodiesterase from cultured tobacco cells.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/colonisation-new-areas-stoats-time-establishment-requirements-detection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629536,"mean":4.93415564694,"rank":816408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629536,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95395,"mean":8.2278181227333,"rank":24815,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95395,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5464,"mean":2.4649394105803,"rank":228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5464,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":1.3338541666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":40,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
