To examine the influence of chronic endurance training and age on lean mass and leg strength, women runners (n = 62, age 43-69 years) and sedentary participants (n = 33, age 43-66 years) were divided into 40-, 50-, and 60-year age groups. Absolute isokinetic concentric torque did not differ between runners and sedentary women (97.9 +\/- 19.5 and 104.6 +\/- 22.7 N . m, respectively, p = .18) but was different between age groups independent of exercise status (107.6 +\/- 18.4, 97.1 +\/- 19.9, and 90.1 +\/- 21.4 N . m, for 40s, 50s, and 60s, respectively, p < .05). Lean body mass also differed by age group (p < .05) but did not change differently among runners and sedentary women. These findings suggest that chronic endurance training might not influence the loss of muscle mass and muscle strength that occur with aging.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059f1","authors":["Tarpenning KM","Hawkins SA","Marcell TJ","Wiswell RA"],"first_seen_on":"2013-06-27T00:31:26+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Aging & Physical Activity","last_mentioned_on":1397901475,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16648648"],"pmid":"16648648","pubdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Health Professions"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Endurance exercise and leg strength in older women.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endurance-exercise-leg-strength-older-women-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":254287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":4252398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89598,"mean":7.4430057702826,"rank":7784,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":81799,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89598,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":2.3643620689655,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.7857142857143,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
