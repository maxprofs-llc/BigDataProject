The aim of this study was to document wait times from referral by physician to consultation with PT or OT in the public health care system for people with arthritis in Quebec, Canada. Method: Appointments were requested by telephone, using hypothetical case scenarios; wait times were defined as the time between initial request and appointment date. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the wait times in relation to diagnosis, service provider and geographic area. Results: For both scenarios (OA and RA) combined, 13% were offered an appointment within 6 months, 13% offered given an appointment within 6-12 months, 24% were told they would need to wait longer than 12 months, and 22% were refused services. The remaining 28% were told they would require an evaluation appointment for functional assessment before being given an appointment for therapy. No difference was found between RA and OA diagnoses. Conclusions: Our study suggests that most people with arthritis living in the province of Quebec are not receiving publicly accessible PT or OT intervention in a timely manner.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c33","authors":["Ashley Delaurier","Sasha Bernatsky","Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Raymond","Debbie Ehrmann Feldman"],"doi":"10.3138\/ptc.2011-62","endpage":"6","first_seen_on":"2013-06-26T11:01:36+00:00","issns":["0300-0508","1708-8313"],"issue":"-1","journal":"Physiotherapy Canada","last_mentioned_on":1366402748,"links":["http:\/\/utpjournals.metapress.com\/content\/q011061v650571lh\/?p=55cb1cf5e5ad41f1b7ba3dffcbcda787&pi=0"],"pmid":"24403693","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"1","title":"Wait Times for Physical and Occupational Therapy in the Public System for People with Arthritis in Quebec","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wait-times-physical-occupational-therapy-public-system-people-arthritis-quebec"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1758975,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2722068,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89549,"mean":7.4276849957566,"rank":31252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":57595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89549,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141,"mean":2.7115285714286,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.05,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
