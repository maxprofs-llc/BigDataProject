The mTORC2 signaling complex functions as the regulatory kinase of the distinct members of AGC kinase family known to regulate cell proliferation and survival. In the early chemotaxis studies in Dictyostelium, the rictor's ortholog has been identified as a regulator of cell migration. How rictor regulates cell migration is poorly characterized. Here we show that rictor regulates cell migration by controlling a potent inhibitor of Rho proteins known as the Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 (RhoGDI2). On the basis of on our proteomics study we identified that the rictor-dependent deficiency in cell migration is caused by upregulation of RhoGDI2 leading to a low activity of Rac and Cdc42. We found that a suppression of RhoGDI2 by rictor is not related to the Sin1 or raptor function that excludes a role of mTORC2 or mTORC1 in regulation of RhoGDI2. Our study reveals that rictor by suppressing RhoGDI2 promotes activity of the Rho proteins and cell migration.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003240","authors":["N K Agarwal","C-H Chen","H Cho","D R Boulb|[egrave]|s","E Spooner","D D Sarbassov","Agarwal NK","Chen CH","Cho H","Boulb\u00e8s DR","Spooner E","Sarbassov DD","D R Boulb\u00e8s"],"doi":"10.1038\/onc.2012.287","endpage":"2526","first_seen_on":"2013-06-27T19:09:25+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["0950-9232","1476-5594"],"issue":"20","journal":"Oncogene","last_mentioned_on":1372360058,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/onc\/journal\/v32\/n20\/full\/onc2012287a.html","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/onc.2012.287"],"pmid":"22777355","pubdate":"2012-07-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2521","subjects":["molecularbiology","neoplasms"],"title":"Rictor regulates cell migration by suppressing RhoGDI2","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/onc.2012.287","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rictor-regulates-cell-migration-suppressing-rhogdi2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2305579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1592185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89599,"mean":7.4457277617806,"rank":45077,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":31393,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89599,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3688,"mean":2.6045646867372,"rank":2074,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3688,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":2.91155,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
