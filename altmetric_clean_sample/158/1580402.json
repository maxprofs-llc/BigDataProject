In principle, conditionally replication-competent adenoviruses that induce tumor oncolysis through cancer-specific replication hold promise for cancer therapy. However, a single-agent approach may not be adequate to completely eradicate cancer in a patient because most cancers arise from abnormalities in multiple genetic and signal transduction pathways and targeting disseminated metastases is difficult to achieve. Based on these considerations, a novel class of cancer destroying adenoviruses have been produced, cancer terminator viruses (CTVs), in which cancer-specific replication is controlled by the progression-elevated gene-3 promoter and replicating viruses produce a second transgene encoding an apoptosis-inducing and immunomodulatory cytokine, either melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7\/interleukin-24 (mda-7\/IL-24) or interferon-\u03b3. This review focuses on these viruses and ways to improve their delivery systemically and enhance their therapeutic efficacy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000cfc3","authors":["Das SK","Sarkar S","Dash R","Dent P","Wang XY","Sarkar D","Fisher PB"],"doi":"10.1016\/b978-0-12-398342-8.00001-x","first_seen_on":"2013-06-25T10:50:09+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["0065-230X","0065230X"],"issue":"","journal":"Advances in cancer research","last_mentioned_on":1372111320,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23021240","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4348031\/"],"pmid":"23021240","pubdate":"2012-10-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Cancer terminator viruses and approaches for enhancing therapeutic outcomes.","type":"article","volume":"115","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cancer-terminator-viruses-approaches-enhancing-therapeutic-outcomes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.608,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.608},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8158093,"mean":6.8931857463664,"rank":996087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7161258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8158093,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125201,"mean":7.015642747604,"rank":16453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":108723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125201,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":2.3490354609929,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
