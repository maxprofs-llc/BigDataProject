The molecularly imprinted polymer grafted on titanium dioxide modified silica fiber was used for microextraction, while the same polymer immobilized on multiwalled carbon nanotubes\/titanium dioxide modified pencil graphite electrode served as a detection tool. In both cases, the surface initiated polymerization was found to be advantageous to obtain a nanometer thin imprinted film. The modified silica fiber exhibited high adsorption capacity and enantioselective diffusion of aspartic acid isomers into respective molecular cavities. This combination enabled double preconcentrations of d- and l-aspartic acid that helped sensing both isomers in real samples, without any cross-selectivity and matrix complications. Taking into account 6\u00d710(4)-fold dilution of serum and 2\u00d710(3)-fold dilution of cerebrospinal fluid required by the proposed method, the limit of detection for l-aspartic acid is 0.031ngmL(-1). Also, taking into account 50-fold dilution required by the proposed method, the limit of detection for d-aspartic acid is 0.031ngmL(-1) in cerebrospinal fluid.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf6","authors":["Prasad BB","Srivastava A","Tiwari MP"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chroma.2013.01.096","first_seen_on":"2013-06-25T16:09:23+00:00","issns":["0021-9673","00219673"],"journal":"Journal of Chromatography A","last_mentioned_on":1372176557,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0021967313002185"],"pmid":"23415444","pubdate":"2013-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Highly sensitive and selective hyphenated technique (molecularly imprinted polymer solid-phase microextraction\u2013molecularly imprinted polymer sensor) for ultra trace analysis of aspartic acid enantiomers ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highly-sensitive-selective-hyphenated-technique-molecularly-imprinted-polymer-solidphase-microextrac"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3072425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":949895,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89622,"mean":7.427314892715,"rank":61525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":17210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89622,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1980,"mean":1.5698635674583,"rank":882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":600,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1980,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":0.62731481481481,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
