Advances in micro-CT imaging and analysis, and available mutant mouse strains, are facilitating rapid progress. Indeed, micro-CT studies show that genetic differences between the CD1 and C57Bl\/6 mouse strains, and between Gcm1 heterozygotes and wild-type littermates alter the developmental trajectory of the fetoplacental arterial tree as do environmental factors including maternal exposure to toxins in cigarette smoke and malarial infection. Relative to other vascular beds, the fetoplacental arterial tree is particularly tractable because veins can more easily be excluded when infusing the contrast agent and because of the placenta's small size, which means that the whole organ can be imaged (maintaining connectivity) and that the tree is simpler (fewer branching generations). Despite these differences, measured parameters were found to be similar to arterial trees in other adult rodent organs. Thus, micro-CT analysis provides a means for advancing of our understanding of the mechanisms controlling development of the fetoplacental arterial tree. Results will likely have relevance to other arterial vasculatures as well.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5043cf058f6100030cb","authors":["Rennie, Monique Y.","Sled, John G.","Adamson, S.
