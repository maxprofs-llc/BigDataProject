In this study we report the in vitro antiproliferative activity of the methanol extract of Morus alba. The extract is capable of inducing cytotoxicity in human colon cancer (HCT-15) cells (IC(50) = 13.8 \u03bcg\/ml) and breast cancer (MCF-7) cells (IC(50) = 9.2 \u03bcg\/ml), resulted in significant morphological changes of the cells, fragmentation of DNA, and caspase-3 activation- characteristics of apoptosis. It downregulated the amount of nitric oxide (NO) produced as a result of inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) activation. The HPLC analysis of the extract showed epicatechin (20%), myricetin (10%), quercetin hydrate (12%), luteolin (12%), and kaempferol (6%) as the major active components and ascorbic acid, gallic acid, pelargonidine, and p-coumaric acid as the minor components. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing the downregulation of iNOS and induction of apoptosis by M. alba extract.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f61000149f","authors":["Deepa M","Sureshkumar T","Satheeshkumar PK","Priya S"],"doi":"10.1080\/01635581.2013.748924","first_seen_on":"2013-06-26T04:49:11+00:00","issns":["0163-5581"],"issue":"2","journal":"Nutrition and Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1372221891,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23441618"],"pmid":"23441618","pubdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Antioxidant Rich Morus alba leaf Extract Induces Apoptosis in Human Colon and Breast Cancer Cells by the Downregulation of Nitric Oxide Produced by Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase.","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antioxidant-rich-morus-alba-leaf-extract-induces-apoptosis-human-colon-breast-cancer-cells-downregul-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228993,"mean":5.9654070340771,"rank":4606439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228993,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99374,"mean":7.5297344952855,"rank":67360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":16970,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99374,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":720,"mean":6.7143866481224,"rank":500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":720,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":12.9964,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lotusctr\/status\/349750080162627585","license":"public","citation_ids":[1583486],"posted_on":"2013-06-26T04:44:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Brandon Horn","url":"http:\/\/www.lotuscenter.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2208905002\/twitter_normal.png","description":"The Lotus Center for Integrative Medicine is one of the first truly integrative practices, including both Western and Chinese medicine","id_on_source":"lotusctr","tweeter_id":"37164081","geo":{"lt":34.05223,"ln":-118.24368,"country":"US"},"followers":251},"tweet_id":"349750080162627585"}]}}
