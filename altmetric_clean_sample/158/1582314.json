In this study, we demonstrated that Tax1 activated an NF-\u03baB binding (gp\u03baB) site of the gp34\/OX40 ligand gene in a cell type-dependent manner. Our examination showed that the gp\u03ba\u0392 site and authentic NF-\u03baB (Ig\u03baB) site were activated by Tax1 in hematopoietic cell lines. Non-hematopoietic cell lines including hepatoma and fibroblast cell lines were not permissive to Tax1-mediated activation of the gp\u03baB site, while the Ig\u03baB site was activated in those cells in association with binding of RelB. However RelA binding was not observed in the gp\u03baB and Ig\u03baB sites. Our results suggest that HTLV-1 Tax1 fails to activate the canonical pathway of NF-\u03baB in non-hematopoietic cell lines. Cell type-dependent activation of NF-\u03baB by Tax1 could be associated with pathogenesis by HTLV-1 infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003769","doi":"10.1016\/j.virol.2013.04.032","first_seen_on":"2013-06-25T18:43:10+00:00","issns":["1096-0341"],"journal":"Virology","last_mentioned_on":1372185754,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23791017?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23791017","pubdate":"2013-06-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Failure in activation of the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 tax in non-hematopoietic cell lines.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/failure-activation-canonical-nf%CE%BAb-pathway-human-tcell-leukemia-virus-type-1-tax-nonhematopoietic-cel-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":3555511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":834116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94019,"mean":7.532713459125,"rank":64019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":15703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94019,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1669,"mean":3.2901810551559,"rank":1278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1669,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":3.7074166666667,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HTLVnet\/statuses\/349598508514418688","license":"public","citation_ids":[1582314],"posted_on":"2013-06-25T18:42:34+00:00","author":{"name":"HTLV.net","url":"http:\/\/htlv.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1412912228\/ira-logo-transparent-75px_normal.png","description":"The International Retrovirology Association","id_on_source":"HTLVnet","tweeter_id":"316102884","geo":{"lt":38.91706,"ln":-77.00025,"country":"US"},"followers":100},"tweet_id":"349598508514418688"}]}}
