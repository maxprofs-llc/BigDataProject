The scaffolds were assessed for: cell attachment using AlamarBlue and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI); contraction using serial photographs; and extracellular matrix production using Sirius red staining, immunostaining and scanning electron microscopy. Finally the biomechanical properties of all the scaffolds were assessed.\nOf the seven, there were two biodegradable scaffolds, synthetic PLA and natural SIS, which supported good cell attachment and proliferation. Immunostaining confirmed the presence of collagen I, III and elastin which was highest in SIS and PLA. The mechanical properties of PLA were closest to native tissue with an ultimate tensile strength of 0.72 \u00b1 0.18 MPa, ultimate tensile strain 0.53 \u00b1 0.16 and Young's modulus 4.5 \u00b1 2.9 MPa. Scaffold restraint did not have a significant impact on the above properties in the best scaffolds.\nThese data support both PLA and SIS as good candidate materials for use in making a tissue-engineered repair material for SUI or POP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000245a","authors":["Mangera, Altaf","Bullock, Anthony J","Roman, Sabiniano","Chapple, Christopher R","MacNeil, Sheila","Bullock, Anthony J.","Chapple, Christopher R.","Altaf Mangera","Anthony J.
