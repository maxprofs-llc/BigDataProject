However, it has been suggested that majority of alleles can be covered within few HLA supertypes, where different members of a supertype bind similar peptides, yet exhibiting distinct repertoires. Nonetheless, the structural basis for HLA supertype-like function is not clearly known. Here, we use structural data to explain the molecular basis for HLA-A2 supertypes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Kangueane P","Sakharkar MK"],"first_seen_on":"2013-06-27T20:40:44+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1346918475,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18449998"],"pmid":"18449998","pubdate":"2008-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Structural basis for HLA-A2 supertypes.","type":"article","volume":"409","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-basis-hlaa2-supertypes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3624912,"mean":4.9388872667219,"rank":2906961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":72736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3624912,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85148,"mean":7.296531574806,"rank":67997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85148,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2355,"mean":1.422582837723,"rank":1442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2355,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.3455454545455,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
