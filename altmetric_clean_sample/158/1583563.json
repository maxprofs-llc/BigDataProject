The main determinants of the transcriptional auxin response machinery are AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) transcription factors and AUXIN\/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (AUX\/IAA) inhibitors. Although members of these two protein families are major developmental regulators, the transcriptional regulation of the genes encoding them has not been well explored. For example, apart from auxin-linked regulatory inputs, factors regulating the expression of the AUX\/IAA BODENLOS (BDL)\/IAA12 are not known. Here, it was shown that the HOMEODOMAIN-LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD-ZIP) transcription factor HOMEOBOX PROTEIN 5 (HB5) negatively regulates BDL expression, which may contribute to the spatial control of BDL expression. As such, HB5 and probably other class I HD-ZIP proteins, appear to modulate BDL-dependent auxin response.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fdd","authors":["Gerd J\u00fcrgens","De Smet I","Lau S","Ehrismann JS","Axiotis I","Kolb M","Kientz M","Weijers D","J\u00fcrgens G","De Smet, Ive","Lau, Steffen","Ehrismann, Jasmin S.","Axiotis, Ioannis","Kolb, Martina","Kientz, Marika","Weijers, Dolf","J\u00fcrgens, Gerd"],"doi":"10.1093\/jxb\/ert137","endpage":"3019","first_seen_on":"2013-06-26T06:32:06+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-4122955","handles":["1854\/LU-4122955"],"issns":["1460-2431","0022-0957"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Experimental Botany","last_mentioned_on":1372234589,"links":["http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/05\/16\/jxb.ert137.full","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/jxb\/ert137"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/05\/16\/jxb.ert137.full.pdf","pmid":"23682118","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"3009","subjects":["botany"],"title":"Transcriptional repression of BODENLOS by HD-ZIP transcription factor HB5 in Arabidopsis thaliana","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transcriptional-repression-bodenlos-hdzip-transcription-factor-hb5-arabid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2305625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1592038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89549,"mean":7.4276252512621,"rank":45045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":31374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89549,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1840,"mean":2.2353398586188,"rank":915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1840,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.29,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
