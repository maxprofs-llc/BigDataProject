A documented deficit of phosphocreatine and reduced mithocondrial energy production can contribute to this imbalance.Aim of this study is to verify whether a dietary supplementation with creatine and coenzyme Q10, important mitochondrial function factors, is able to influence this mechanism leading to a dyspnea reduction and improving exercise tolerance and quality of life.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"508ef9853cf0583035000000","doi":"10.1186\/2049-6958-8-40","first_seen_on":"2013-06-27T10:18:13+00:00","issns":["1828-695X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Multidisciplinary Respiratory Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1426356800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23800154?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3707735\/"],"pmid":"23800154","pubdate":"2013-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Effects of nutraceutical diet integration, with coenzyme Q10 (Q-Ter multicomposite) and creatine, on dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and quality of life in COPD patients with chronic respiratory failure","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-nutraceutical-diet-integration-coenzyme-q10-qter-multicomposite-creatine-dyspnea-exercise-to"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4868490,"mean":5.7954838530026,"rank":3445623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":795294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4868490,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92681,"mean":7.5621506905481,"rank":63319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":15357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92681,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":3.6808723404255,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":5,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
