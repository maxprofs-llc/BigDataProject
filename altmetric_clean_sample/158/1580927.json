In an in vitro intestinal explant model of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), gangliosides have been shown to ameliorate intestinal injury; however, possible immunomodulatory mechanisms associated with this observation, as well as potential in vivo protective effects of gangliosides, remain unknown. The present study evaluates the effects of dietary GD3, the predominant ganglioside in neonatal rat intestine, both on the clinicopathologic expression of disease and on ileal Foxp3+ T regulatory cell immune responses in an experimental NEC model.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dcf","doi":"10.1097\/mpg.0b013e3182a027e1","first_seen_on":"2013-06-25T12:21:01+00:00","issns":["0277-2116"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology & Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1384405135,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jpgn\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Dietary_GD3_Ganglioside_Reduces_the_Incidence_and.98628.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jpgn\/Abstract\/2013\/11000\/Dietary_GD3_Ganglioside_Reduces_the_Incidence_and.3.aspx","http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/jpgn\/_layouts\/oaks.journals.mobile\/abstractviewer.aspx?year=2013&issue=11000&article=00003"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jpgn\/9000\/00000\/Dietary_GD3_Ganglioside_Reduces_the_Incidence_and.98628.pdf","pmid":"23783008","pubdate":"2013-06-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["pediatrics","gastroenterology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Dietary GD3 Ganglioside Reduces the Incidence and Severity of Necrotizing Enterocolitis by Sustaining Regulatory Immune Responses","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dietary-gd3-ganglioside-reduces-incidence-severity-necrotizing-enterocolitis-sustaining-regulatory-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770902,"mean":5.7220129992239,"rank":2533739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1587646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770902,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91788,"mean":7.5806327693465,"rank":46005,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":32996,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91788,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2060,"mean":2.6454997571637,"rank":1143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2060,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":2.1783185840708,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
