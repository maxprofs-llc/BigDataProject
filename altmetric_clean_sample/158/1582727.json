After the HIV pandemic and the introduction of immunomodulatory therapy, the PML incidence significantly increased. The correlation between the use of natalizumab, a drug used in multiple sclerosis (MS), and the PML development of particular relevance. The high incidence of PML in natalizumab-treated patients has highlighted the importance of two factors: the need of PML risk stratification among natalizumab-treated patients and the need of effective therapeutic options. In this review, we discuss these two needs under the light of the major viral models of PML etiopathogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002544","authors":["Diotti, Roberta Antonia"],"doi":"10.1155\/2013\/967581","first_seen_on":"2013-06-25T22:01:24+00:00","issns":["1740-2522"],"journal":"Clinical & Developmental Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1372230848,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/cdi\/2013\/967581\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/cdi\/2013\/967581.pdf","pmid":"23878587","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"JC Polyomavirus (JCV) and Monoclonal Antibodies: Friends or Potential Foes?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/jc-polyomavirus-jcv-monoclonal-antibodies-friends-potential-foes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3072424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":949896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89622,"mean":7.427314892715,"rank":61525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":17210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89622,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":292,"mean":2.3381030927835,"rank":200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":292,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.9166666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
