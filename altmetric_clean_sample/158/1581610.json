In response to the incentives for meaningful use of health information technology and other market forces, hospitals in the United States are increasingly moving toward the adoption of CPOE. The purpose of this study was to characterize the experiences of hospitals that have successfully implemented CPOE.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007c4","doi":"10.1186\/1472-6947-13-67","first_seen_on":"2013-06-25T14:15:34+00:00","issns":["1472-6947"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making","last_mentioned_on":1375627173,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6947\/13\/67\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6947-13-67.pdf","pmid":"23800211","pubdate":"2013-06-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Geomatic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"67","subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Lessons learned from implementation of computerized provider order entry in 5 community hospitals: a qualitative study","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lessons-learned-implementation-computerized-provider-order-entry-5-community-hospitals-qualitative-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1008309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2928932,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89621,"mean":7.42730069181,"rank":24580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":63118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89621,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":754,"mean":3.9829747675963,"rank":256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":754,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":4.0173913043478,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
