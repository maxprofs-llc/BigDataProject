Therefore, our aim was to determine if NO supplementation in vivo would attenuate A\u03b2PP and BACE1 protein levels. cGMP levels were significantly increased while A\u03b2PP and BACE1 protein levels were statistically lower in cerebral microvessels from nitroglycerin-treated eNOS-\/- mice as compared to vehicle-treated mice. Our findings support the concept that preservation of NO\/cGMP signaling is an important modulator of expression and processing of A\u03b2PP.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c7a","doi":"10.3233\/jad-2012-121351","first_seen_on":"2013-06-26T11:20:07+00:00","funders":["nigms","nhlbi"],"issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Alzheimer's Disease","last_mentioned_on":1344870753,"links":["http:\/\/iospress.metapress.com\/content\/n83r346607766v48\/"],"pmid":"22886025","pubdate":"2012-08-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["geriatrics","neurology"],"title":"Supplementation of Nitric Oxide Attenuates A\u03b2PP and BACE1 Protein in Cerebral Microcirculation of eNOS-Deficient Mice.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/supplementation-nitric-oxide-attenuates-app-bace1-protein-cerebral-microcirculation-enosdeficient-mi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":2899697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":79314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85273,"mean":7.2381679801109,"rank":67826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85273,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":797,"mean":4.8801331658291,"rank":587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":797,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":19.797777777778,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/AnestesiaF\/status\/235031091294130176","citation_ids":[1585043],"posted_on":"2012-08-13T15:12:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
