Typically, this is justified by the argument that certain occupations are either too dangerous or require high levels of physical skills and mental work. Every worker has to leave the workforce at that age. However, starting from the last two decades of the last century, it is observed that retirees live more years in retirement than ever before. This relatively long retirement as well as retirees' body fitness made many of them engage in new jobs which are either similar to their career jobs, or completely different from them. In this new type of employment which is called \"bridge employment', the retired worker may spend more than ten years. But, to what extent these new jobs are fitted to the aged worker? Considering that experiencing any type of event increases the risk of worse health outcomes over time, bridge employment should be ergonomically designed if it is to fit the aged worker characteristics (physical, mental and affective).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5683cf058f610004ae1","doi":"10.3233\/wor-2012-0174-307","first_seen_on":"2013-06-26T11:03:50+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Work","last_mentioned_on":1332507741,"links":["http:\/\/iospress.metapress.com\/content\/6h1u05043px527r6\/fulltext.html"],"pmid":"22316740","pubdate":"2013-05-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["occupationalmedicine"],"title":"Ergonomics of bridge employment.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ergonomics-bridge-employment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2923897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1435028,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89549,"mean":7.4276849957566,"rank":58311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":28102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89549,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312,"mean":2.6289774919614,"rank":197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.8125,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
