Benign cases were categorized based on laparoscopic approach, classified as total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH), laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH), or laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (LSH). We assessed changes in the use of these approaches during 2007 to 2012, and used multinomial logistic regression to examine the association of patient and hospital characteristics with the choice of laparoscopic approach in 2012. The NIS sample weights were applied to generate nationally representative estimates.\nRetrospective study (Canadian Task Force classification III).\nHospital inpatient care nationwide.\nFemale adult patients in the NIS database who underwent an inpatient laparoscopic hysterectomy between 2007 and\u00a02012.\nInpatient laparoscopic hysterectomy.\nOf the inpatient laparoscopic hysterectomies performed in 2012, 83.2% were for benign indications. The TLH approach accounted for 48.3% of all laparoscopic hysterectomies, followed by LAVH at 37.3% and LSH at 14.4%. Robotic assistance was reported in 45.0% of all cases and 72.3% of malignant hysterectomies. An examination of temporal trends during 2007 to 2012 demonstrates a shift in the laparoscopic approach from LAVH toward TLH, with a slight decrease in LSH. Patient race\/ethnicity, income, indication for hysterectomy, and comorbid conditions, as well as hospital teaching status, urban\/rural location, bed size, type of ownership, and geographic region, were significantly associated with the choice of laparoscopic approach.\nBenign laparoscopic hysterectomy is increasingly performed as TLH rather than LAVH. In addition to clinical factors, the selection of laparoscopic approach is influenced by patient socioeconomic and hospital characteristics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d61","authors":["Desai, Vrunda Bhavsar","Guo, Xiaoyue M","Fan, Linda","Wright, Jason D","Xu, Xiao"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jmig.2016.08.830","endpage":"158.e1","first_seen_on":"2017-01-09T15:01:04+00:00","issns":["1553-4669","15534650"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology","last_mentioned_on":1483974000,"links":["http:\/\/www.jmig.org\/article\/S1553-4650(16)31037-8\/pdf"],"pmid":"27614151","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"151","subjects":["gynecology"],"title":"Inpatient Laparoscopic Hysterectomy in the United States: Trends and Factors Associated With Approach Selection","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inpatient-laparoscopic-hysterectomy-united-states-trends-factors-associated-approach-selection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029393,"mean":6.8051641093086,"rank":5807137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1936594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029393,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253862,"mean":12.745138197675,"rank":168229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":71775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253862,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":583,"mean":2.4911821305842,"rank":310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":583,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":4.3153846153846,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AAGLJMIG\/statuses\/818472395728158720","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15334850],"posted_on":"2017-01-09T15:00:00+00:00","author":{"name":"JMIG","url":"http:\/\/www.jmig.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/712678909859344385\/KUkLtHd-_normal.jpg","description":"Journal of Minimally Invasive #Gynecology: an internationally renowned forum for the exchange & dissemination of ideas, findings & techniques for #gyn #surgery.","id_on_source":"AAGLJMIG","tweeter_id":"712678414730199040","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":842},"tweet_id":"818472395728158720"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=390180111324962&id=243149652694676","license":"public","citation_ids":[15334850],"posted_on":"2017-01-09T14:59:59+00:00","summary":"Recent trends in laparoscopic #hysterectomy: http:\/\/buff.ly\/2jc0YHi","author":{"name":"JMIG","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/243149652694676","facebook_wall_name":"JMIG","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/243149652694676\/picture","id_on_source":"243149652694676"}}]}}
