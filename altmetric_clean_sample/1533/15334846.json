The clinical disciplines responsible for her case formed a collaborative care plan involving ventilator, nutrition, and medication support of the mother and regular fetal monitoring and ultrasound testing. A planned delivery by cesarean at term resulted in a good neonatal outcome.\nThere is no standardized management plan for obstetric care in a persistent vegetative state. This case illustrates a successful multidisciplinary approach that may be useful as a template in similar situations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003224","authors":["Romagano, Matthew P.","Scorza, William E.","Lammers, Stephen E.","Dorr, Carole","Smulian, John C."],"doi":"10.1097\/aog.0000000000001759","endpage":"110","first_seen_on":"2017-01-09T15:00:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-233X","0029-7844"],"issue":"1","journal":"Obstetrics & Gynecology","last_mentioned_on":1484077614,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/greenjournal\/Abstract\/2017\/01000\/Treatment_of_a_Pregnant_Patient_in_a_Persistent.14.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/greenjournal\/2017\/01000\/Treatment_of_a_Pregnant_Patient_in_a_Persistent.14.pdf","pmid":"27926646","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"107","subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Treatment of a Pregnant Patient in a Persistent Vegetative State","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/greenjournal\/Fulltext\/2017\/01000\/Treatment_of_a_Pregnant_Patient_in_a_Persistent.14.aspx","volume":"129","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/treatment-pregnant-patient-persistent-vegetative-state-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":2.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8098657,"mean":6.887469337127,"rank":3247587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4826337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8098657,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258465,"mean":12.732679924476,"rank":99420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":157677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258465,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4701,"mean":10.572441276596,"rank":3126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1560,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4701,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":15.770906976744,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
