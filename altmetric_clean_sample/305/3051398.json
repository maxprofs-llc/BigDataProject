Methods: Pregnant women were divided into three groups, namely healthy pregnants (Group 1, n\u2009=\u200920), pregnants with mild preeclampsia (Group 2, n\u2009=\u200920) and pregnants with severe preeclampsia (Group 3, n\u2009=\u200920). The groups were formed so as to match each other in terms of gestational week. From each pregnant woman, pre- and post-delivery blood samples were obtained to measure serum TN-C levels. The data were evaluated using the Kruskall-Wallis variance analysis. For the obtained values of p\u2009<\u20090.05, the groups were compared in pairs. A p value of <\u20090.017 was accepted as significant. Results: In Groups 1, 2 and 3, the prepartum TN-C levels were 5.02\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009\u00b5g\/ml, 12.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9\u2009\u00b5g\/ml and 33.8\u2009\u00b1\u200911.7\u2009\u00b5g\/ml, and in the postpartum TN-C levels were 4.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2009\u00b5g\/ml, 11.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8\u2009\u00b5g\/ml and 50.6\u2009\u00b1\u200933.8\u2009\u00b5g\/ml, respectively. There was a significant difference between the groups in terms of the prepartum and postpartum TN-C levels (p\u2009<\u20090.017, Mann-Whitney U [MWU] test). There was also a significant difference in the prepartum TN-C levels between Groups 2 and 3 (p\u2009<\u20090.017, MWU test). Conclusions: The prepartum and postpartum TN-C levels were significantly higher in mild and severe preeclampsia than those in healthy pregnants.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610004043","authors":["Ugur Orak","Ebru Celik","Salih Burcin Kavak","\u0130smail Demirel","Remzi Atilgan","Suleyman Aydin","Ekrem Sapmaz","Orak U","Celik E","Kavak SB","Demirel \u0130","Atilgan R","Aydin S","Sapmaz E"],"doi":"10.3109\/14767058.2014.998191","endpage":"273","first_seen_on":"2015-01-09T15:26:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-4954","1476-7058"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1474625712,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25567561\/?i=1&from=orak%20u","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25567561?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25567561","pubdate":"2015-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"270","subjects":["obstetrics","perinatology"],"title":"Tenascin C levels in patients with mild and severe preeclampsia.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tenascin-c-levels-patients-mild-severe-preeclampsia-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":6089475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2031442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241194,"mean":8.023413332891,"rank":147937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":80504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241194,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1445,"mean":2.5040235457064,"rank":654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1445,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":2.7031666666667,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"TR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SalihBurcin\/status\/553573414922121216","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3051398],"posted_on":"2015-01-09T15:26:01+00:00","author":{"name":"salih bur\u00e7in kavak","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/512991682627788800\/mOEIt6Si_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"SalihBurcin","tweeter_id":"2776063761","geo":{"lt":"38.5572753","ln":"39.4141458","country":"TR"},"followers":16},"tweet_id":"553573414922121216"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/779262836908318721","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[3051398],"posted_on":"2016-09-23T10:15:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
