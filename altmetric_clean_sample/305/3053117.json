A significant body of literature has occurred over the past four decades regarding motor cortex signal extraction for upper extremity movement or computer interface. However, little is discussed regarding postural or ambulation command signaling. Auditory prosthesis research continues to represent the majority of literature on BCI signal insertion. Significant hurdles continue in the technological translation of BCI implants. These include developing a stable neural interface, significantly increasing signal processing capabilities, and methods of data transfer throughout the human body. The past few years, however, have provided extraordinary human examples of BCI implant potential. Despite technological hurdles, proof-of-concept animal and human studies provide significant encouragement that BCI implants may well find their way into mainstream medical practice in the foreseeable future.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f61000318f","authors":["Konrad P","Shanks T"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nbd.2009.12.007","first_seen_on":"2015-01-10T00:42:15+00:00","issns":["0969-9961"],"issue":"3","journal":"Neurobiology of Disease","last_mentioned_on":1420844760,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20035870"],"pmid":"20035870","pubdate":"2009-12-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Implantable brain computer interface: challenges to neurotechnology translation.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/implantable-brain-computer-interface-challenges-neurotechnology-translation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.232,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.232},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4714550,"mean":5.4408440013467,"rank":779377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3934343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4714550,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156807,"mean":8.4804907210185,"rank":32557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":124243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156807,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":808,"mean":3.7709591078067,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":808,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":3.3323243243243,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Ph.
