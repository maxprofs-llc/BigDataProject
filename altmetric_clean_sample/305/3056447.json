Here, we incorporate DMS data into automated secondary structure inference using an energy minimization framework developed for 2'-OH acylation (SHAPE) mapping. On six noncoding RNAs with crystallographic models, DMS-guided modeling achieves overall false negative and false discovery rates of 9.5% and 11.6%, respectively, comparable to or better than those of SHAPE-guided modeling, and bootstrapping provides straightforward confidence estimates. Integrating DMS-SHAPE data and including 1-cyclohexyl(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate (CMCT) reactivities provide small additional improvements. These results establish DMS mapping, an already routine technique, as a quantitative tool for unbiased RNA secondary structure modeling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["Pablo Cordero"],"doi":"10.1021\/bi3008802","first_seen_on":"2015-01-12T02:10:44+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":[],"journal":"Biochemistry (00062979)","last_mentioned_on":1421024008,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/bi3008802"],"pmid":"22913637","pubdate":"2012-08-24T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Quantitative DMS mapping for automated RNA secondary structure inference.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-dimethyl-sulfate-mapping-automated-rna-secondary-structure-inference"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4725372,"mean":5.5327771448137,"rank":3243025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":888452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4725372,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158004,"mean":8.6390605621413,"rank":107243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":33136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158004,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6262,"mean":2.2652774317202,"rank":4708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":1195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6262,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":1.5385913043478,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
