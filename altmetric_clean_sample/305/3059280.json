Nasty buggers. #straya #evilwildlife","@fudgeh0g In the wild, paralysis is usually not a problem for the common native hosts; mostly immune as adults ."],"citation":{"abstract":"The clinical and neurophysiological findings in six Australian children with generalized tick paralysis are described. Paralysis is usually caused by the mature female of the species Ixodes holocyclus. It most frequently occurs in the spring and summer months but can be seen at any time of year. Children aged 1-5 years are most commonly affected. The tick is usually found in the scalp, often behind the ear. The typical presentation is a prodrome followed by the development of an unsteady gait, and then ascending, symmetrical, flaccid paralysis. Early cranial nerve involvement is a feature, particularly the presence of both internal and external ophthalmoplegia. In contrast to the experience with North American ticks, worsening of paralysis in the 24-48 h following tick removal is common and the child must be carefully observed over this period. Death from respiratory failure was relatively common in the first half of the century and tick paralysis remains a potentially fatal condition. Respiratory support may be required for > 1 week but full recovery occurs. This is slow with several weeks passing before the child can walk unaided. Anti-toxin has a role in the treatment of seriously ill children but there is a high incidence of acute allergy and serum sickness. Neurophysiological studies reveal low-amplitude compound muscle action potentials with normal motor conduction velocities, normal sensory studies and normal response to repetitive stimulation. The biochemical structure of the toxin of I. holocyclus has not been fully characterized but there are many clinical, neurophysiological and experimental similarities to botulinum toxin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000242e","authors":["P J Grattan-Smith","J G Morris","H M Johnston","C Yiannikas","R Malik","R Russell","R A Ouvrier","Grattan-Smith, P J","Morris, J G","Johnston, H M","Yiannikas, C","Malik, R","Russell, R","Ouvrier, R A"],"doi":"10.1093\/brain\/120.11.1975","endpage":"1987","first_seen_on":"2015-01-13T01:30:54+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1460-2156","0006-8950","14602156"],"issue":"11","journal":"Brain: A Journal of Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1478874106,"links":["http:\/\/brain.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/brain\/120\/11\/1975.full.pdf","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9397015","http:\/\/m.brain.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/brain\/120\/11\/1975.full.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/brain.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/brain\/120\/11\/1975.full.pdf","pmid":"9397015","pubdate":"2016-08-28T20:55:01+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1975","subjects":["brain","neurology"],"title":"Clinical and neurophysiological features of tick paralysis.","type":"article","volume":"120 ( Pt 11)","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-neurophysiological-features-tick-paralysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":67.5,"score_history":{"1y":67,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":67.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7679268,"mean":6.5932591477757,"rank":114616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7564635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7679268,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236889,"mean":7.857333119449,"rank":4848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":232036,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236889,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3610,"mean":13.015875311721,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":3494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3610,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":18.907104477612,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
