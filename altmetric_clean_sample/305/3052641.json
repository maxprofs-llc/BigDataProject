In healthy joints, lubricin molecules coat the cartilage surface, providing boundary lubrication and preventing cell and protein adhesion. Arthropathy occurring in patients with joint trauma, inflammatory arthritis or genetically mediated lubricin deficiencies have insufficient lubricin to prevent damage to articular cartilage. Recent studies in lubricin null joints indicate that lubricin (Prg4) plays a role in preventing damage to the superficial zone and preservation of chondrocytes. Progress in the production of recombinant forms of lubricin and the successes of lubricin supplementation in small animal models identify rhPRG4 as a potential therapeutic for patients with transient lubricin deficiency in the setting of trauma or autoimmune arthritis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5013cf058f610003077","authors":["Jay GD","Waller KA"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.matbio.2014.08.008","first_seen_on":"2015-01-09T22:47:40+00:00","funders":["niams","nigms"],"issns":["0945053X"],"journal":"Matrix Biology","last_mentioned_on":1491562752,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0945053X14001619","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.matbio.2014.08.008","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25172828"],"pmid":"25172828","pubdate":"2014-08-26T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"The biology of Lubricin: Near frictionless joint motion.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biology-lubricin-near-frictionless-joint-motion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14,"score_history":{"1y":10,"6m":10,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002981,"mean":6.7515998143141,"rank":562309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7433550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002981,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237331,"mean":7.8594061264907,"rank":20784,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":216324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237331,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":348,"mean":2.0616311239193,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":348,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.2115384615385,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
