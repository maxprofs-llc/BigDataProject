In this modest-sized pilot study, we examined the relationship between social worries and gaze patterns to static social stimuli in adolescents with ASD (n\u00a0=\u00a015) and gender-matched adolescents without ASD (control; n\u00a0=\u00a018). Among cognitively unimpaired adolescents with ASD, self-reported fear of negative evaluation predicted greater gaze duration to social threat cues (i.e., faces depicting disgust and anger). By comparison, there was no relationship between self-reported social fears and gaze duration in the controls. These findings call attention to the potential import of the impact of co-occurring psychopathology such as social anxiety, and particularly fear of negative evaluation, on social attention and cognition with adolescents who have ASD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cb4","authors":["Susan W.
