It was observed that the apparent binding constant increased in the presence of co-solutes, the dependence of the logarithm of the apparent binding constant on molar concentration being indistinguishable and essentially linear for both co-solutes. This activation of the TyrR-oligonucleotide interaction is attributed to thermodynamic nonideality arising from molecular crowding, an interpretation which is supported by the reasonable agreement observed between the experimental extent of reaction enhancement and that predicted on the statistical-mechanical basis of excluded volume.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1997BpJ....73.3257P","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c89","authors":["J Poon","M Bailey","D J Winzor","B E Davidson","W H Sawyer"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0006-3495(97)78350-4","first_seen_on":"2015-01-12T18:27:57+00:00","issns":["0006-3495"],"issue":"6","journal":"Biophysical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1421069460,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9414236"],"pmcid":"PMC1181227","pmid":"9414236","pubdate":"1997-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Effects of molecular crowding on the interaction between DNA and the Escherichia coli regulatory protein TyrR.","type":"article","volume":"73","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-molecular-crowding-interaction-between-dna-escherichia-coli-regulatory-protein-tyrr-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.024,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.024},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4725861,"mean":5.5589956761318,"rank":825479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3896046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4725861,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158022,"mean":8.7490185481677,"rank":34187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":123809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158022,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2178,"mean":2.7996095544327,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":1980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2178,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":9.8473913043478,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
