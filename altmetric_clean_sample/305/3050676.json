Research Design and Methods: This was a post hoc analysis of 2-week data from 2 previously published, similarly designed randomized, placebo-controlled trials of 4 weeks' duration comparing esomeprazole 20 mg, 40 mg (1 study), and placebo. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for both trials were the same. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT00628342; NCT00660660 Main Outcome Measures: The main outcome measures for this analysis were the resolution and\/or relief of GERD-related sleep disturbances during 2 weeks of treatment with esomeprazole 20 mg or placebo. Resolution and\/or relief of heartburn symptoms were also measured. Results: In trial 1, 455 subjects were randomized, with 225 and 229 receiving esomeprazole 20 mg and placebo, respectively. In trial 2, 276 subjects were randomized, with 142 and 132 receiving esomeprazole and placebo, respectively. After 2 weeks, significantly more subjects who received esomeprazole 20 mg (50.5% [95% confidence interval: 43.8%-57.1%] and 39.4% [31.2%-47.6%] in trials 1 and 2, respectively) had resolution of sleep disturbances compared to placebo (19.9% [14.6%-25.2%] and 16.0% [9.6%-22.4%], respectively; p<.0001 for both trials). The median time to resolution of sleep disturbances with esomeprazole 20 mg was 1 day in both trials. After 2 weeks, significantly more subjects receiving esomeprazole 20 mg (32.3% [26.1%-38.5%] and 26.3% [18.9%-33.6%] in trials 1 and 2, respectively) had resolution of nighttime heartburn symptoms compared to placebo (5.4% [2.4%-8.4%] and 4.8% [1.1%-8.5%], respectively; p<.0001 for both trials). Conclusions: Esomeprazole 20 mg significantly and effectively reduced nighttime heartburn and GERD-related sleep disturbances in the first 2 weeks of treatment compared to placebo, with rapid resolution of sleep disturbances in the first days of treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002692","authors":["David A.
