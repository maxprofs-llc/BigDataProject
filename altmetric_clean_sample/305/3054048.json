Despite the fact that pea crabs can cause serious problems in bivalve aquaculture, the available information about the ecology of these crabs from Central America is extremely limited. Therefore, the present study aimed to describe different reproductive features of the pinnotherid crab Austinotheresangelicus associated with the oyster Saccostreapalmula in the Golfo de Nicoya, Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Monthly sampling was conducted from April to December 2012. Average carapace width (CW) of the 47 analyzed ovigerous females was 7.62 mm. The species produced on average 2677 \u00b1 1754 recently -extruded embryos with an average volume of 0.020 \u00b1 0.003 mm(3); embryo volume increased during embryogenesis by 21%, but did not vary significantly between developmental stages. Brood mass volume varied greatly (between 11.7 and 236.7 mm(3)), and increased significantly with female CW. Females invested on average 76.7% (minimum: 21.7%; maximum: 162.8%) of their body weight in brood production, which confirms a substantially higher energy allocation for embryo production in pinnotherid crabs compared to free-living decapods.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53d3cf058f610004744","authors":["Salas-Moya C","Mena S","Wehrtmann IS"],"doi":"10.3897\/zookeys.457.7851","first_seen_on":"2015-01-10T08:06:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1313-2989"],"issue":"457","journal":"ZooKeys","last_mentioned_on":1420628750,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25561840?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25561840","pubdate":"2015-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Reproductive traits of the symbiotic pea crab Austinotheresangelicus (Crustacea, Pinnotheridae) living in Saccostreapalmula (Bivalvia, Ostreidae), Pacific coast of Costa Rica.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reproductive-traits-symbiotic-pea-crab-austinotheres-angelicus-crustacea-pinnotheridae-living-saccos"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4707237,"mean":5.4401106722151,"rank":2419690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1671016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4707237,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156453,"mean":8.481803760898,"rank":79978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":57743,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156453,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1568,"mean":12.049827696235,"rank":1049,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1568,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":19.9986,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
