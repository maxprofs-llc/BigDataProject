Their activities are often analyzed by Western blot, which is limited by its multiplexing capability, the quality of isoform-specific antibodies, and the accuracy of quantification. To overcome these issues, a quantitative multiplexed small GTPase activity assay has been developed. Using four different binding domains, this assay allows the binding of up to 12 active small GTPase isoforms simultaneously in a single experiment. To accurately quantify the closely related small GTPase isoforms, a targeted proteomic approach, i.e. selected\/multiple reaction monitoring, was developed, and its functionality and reproducibility was validated. This assay was successfully applied to human platelets, and revealed time-resolved co-activation of multiple small GTPase isoforms in response to agonists and differential activation of these isoforms in response to inhibitor treatment. This widely applicable approach can be used for signaling pathway studies and inhibitor screening in many cellular systems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e0f","authors":["Zhang C","Li R","Jiang H","Lin S","Rogalski JC","Liu K","Kast J"],"doi":"10.1021\/pr501010v","first_seen_on":"2015-01-12T10:17:06+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["1535-3893"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","last_mentioned_on":1457177347,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25569337?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/pr501010v","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25569337?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25569337","pubdate":"2015-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Development and application of a quantitative multiplexed small GTPase activity assay using targeted proteomics.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-application-quantitative-multiplexed-small-gtpase-activity-assay-using-targeted-proteomi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7351662,"mean":6.3871000458227,"rank":1734003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":5600377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7351662,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233206,"mean":7.8026813661801,"rank":62710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":169702,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233206,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2687,"mean":3.6055264333582,"rank":485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":2196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2687,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":1.5961111111111,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
