However current methods of using cell free DNA require amplification, which leads to allelic dropout and bias especially when starting with small amounts of DNA. Here we describe an amplification-free method for sequencing of cell-free DNA, even from low levels of starting material. We evaluated this method in the context of prenatal diagnosis of fetal aneuploidy and compared it with a PCR-based library preparation method as well as a recently described method using unique molecular identifiers (UMI). All methods performed well, however coverage was increased by the amplification-free method and GC-induced bias was reduced by both the amplification-free method and the UMI method. Future diagnostic applications including whole genome sequencing of cell-free DNA will benefit from amplification-free sequencing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002945","authors":["Karlsson K","Sahlin E","Iwarsson E","Westgren M","Nordenskj\u00f6ld M","Linnarsson S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ygeno.2014.12.005","first_seen_on":"2015-01-10T02:06:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["08887543"],"issue":"","journal":"Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1421797840,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25543032","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S088875431400278X","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S088875431400278X?sf7027905=1","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S088875431400278X?sf7027904=1"],"pmid":"25543032","pubdate":"2014-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Amplification-free sequencing of cell-free DNA for prenatal non-invasive diagnosis of chromosomal aberrations ","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/amplificationfree-sequencing-cellfree-dna-prenatal-noninvasive-diagnosis-chromosomal-aberrations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6489380,"mean":5.9656042465691,"rank":2208232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4232076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6489380,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":205203,"mean":8.1125410473584,"rank":66038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":137298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":205203,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3272,"mean":2.9794827269948,"rank":2959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3272,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":3.5084444444444,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":27,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
