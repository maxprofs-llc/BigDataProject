Adjacent tandem aneurysms arise within the same vascular segment and their presence often suggests diffuse parent vessel anomaly. Endovascular management of these rare lesions has not been well studied. In this retrospective observational study, we describe our experience treating adjacent tandem intracranial aneurysms with endovascular embolization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002157","authors":["Ning Lin","Adam M.
