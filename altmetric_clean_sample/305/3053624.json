Patient-level clinical data were reviewed to verify diagnoses and to abstract data on size of baseline M-protein and type of MGUS, i.e., immunoglobulin (Ig) subtype or light-chain, when available. Metformin users were defined as patients that were prescribed metformin for at least 4 years, with no single break between consecutive prescriptions \u22656 months. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models were used to analyze the association between metformin use and the progression of MGUS to MM.\nThe analytic cohort consisted of 2,003 MGUS patients with a median follow-up time of 69 months. Within the analytic cohort, 463 metformin users (23\u00b71%) were identified. Among the metformin users, 13 patients progressed to MM, while 74 patients progressed to MM among the non-metformin users. Metformin use was associated with a reduced risk of transformation to MM (Hazard ratio, HR: 0\u00b747; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0\u00b725-0\u00b787).\nFor diabetics diagnosed with MGUS, metformin use for 4 years or longer was associated with a reduced risk of transformation of MGUS to MM. Prospective studies are required to determine whether this association is causal and whether these results can be extrapolated to non-diabetics.","altmetric_jid":"55b0f02d2a83ee6a598b4581","authors":["Chang, Su-Hsin","Luo, Suhong","O'Brian, Katiuscia K","Thomas, Theodore S","Colditz, Graham A","Carlsson, Nils P","Carson, Kenneth R"],"doi":"10.1016\/s2352-3026(14)00037-4","endpage":"e36","first_seen_on":"2015-01-10T05:51:41+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["2352-3026","23523026"],"issue":"1","journal":"The Lancet Haematology","last_mentioned_on":1476278040,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?code=lancet-site&rc=6&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelancet.com%2Fjournals%2Flanhae%2Farticle%2FPIIS2352-3026%252814%252900037-4%2Ffulltext","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelancet.com%2Fjournals%2Flanhae%2Farticle%2FPIIS2352-3026%252814%252900037-4%2Ffulltext&code=lancet-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelancet.com%2Fjournals%2Flanhae%2Farticle%2FPIIS2352-3026%252814%252900037-4%2Fabstract%3Felsca1%3Detoc%26elsca2%3Demail%26elsca3%3D2352-3026_201501_2_1_%26elsca4%3DLancet&code=lancet-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelancet.com%2Fjournals%2Flanhae%2Farticle%2FPIIS2352-3026%252814%252900037-4%2Ffulltext&code=lancet-site","http:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/lanhae\/article\/PIIS2352-3026%2814%2900037-4\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26034780","http:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/lanhae\/article\/PIIS2352-3026(14)00037-4\/abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26034780\/?i=2&from=\/27701912\/related"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/article\/S2352302614000374\/pdf","pmid":"26034780","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","startpage":"e30","title":"Association between metformin use and progression of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to multiple myeloma in US veterans with diabetes mellitus: a population-based retrospective cohort study ","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-metformin-transformation-monoclonal-gammopathy-undetermined-significance-multipl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.85,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7529066,"mean":6.5069445313556,"rank":1237290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6287594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7529066,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233516,"mean":7.7972113654371,"rank":43666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":189653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233516,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195,"mean":15.531412371134,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":11.813361702128,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
