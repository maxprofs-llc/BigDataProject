A highly presensitized heart recipient received immunoadsorption and rituximab therapy. The patient, with end-stage heart failure, was positive only for antibodies of HLA class I (anti-A2, A10, B17), and Luminex platform (One Lambda kit) showed a panel-reactive antibody score of 64%. The patient's serum was tested repeatedly in both complement-dependent cytotoxicity and flow-cytometry crossmatches against cells from different potential organ donors. The results of these crossmatches were positive on flow cytometry when tested with HLA-A2, A10, and B17 but were still negative on cytotoxicity. The patient was treated with a desensitization regimen; this treatment immediately decreased antibody levels of 70% and the patient subsequently received a transplant with donor-specific HLA antibody (HLA-A2). After more than 2 years, graft function remains normal and the clinical status of the patient is stable.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c65","authors":["Marianna Resse"],"doi":"10.7182\/pit2013454","first_seen_on":"2015-01-12T21:54:31+00:00","issns":["1526-9248"],"issue":"2","journal":"Progress in Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1421099968,"links":["http:\/\/natco.metapress.com\/content\/b653332159w85v64\/?genre=article&id=doi%3A10.7182%2Fpit2013454"],"pmid":"23782659","pubdate":"2013-06-21T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Heart transplant with donor-specific antibody after immunoadsorption plus rituximab: a case report.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/heart-transplant-donorspecific-antibody-after-immunoadsorption-plus-rituximab-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4725861,"mean":5.5589956761318,"rank":1984267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2678889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4725861,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158022,"mean":8.7488888185748,"rank":60931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":94861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158022,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":3.2927843137255,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":3,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
