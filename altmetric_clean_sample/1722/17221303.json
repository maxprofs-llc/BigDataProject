The purposes of this study were to genetically and clinically characterize a family with many members affected by PFE and to describe the natural evolution of the disorder.\nThree generations of a family with 18 members, 10 of them clinically affected by PFE, were evaluated periodically during 20\u00a0years of clinical follow-up. PFE was observed in varying degrees of severity in both sexes. Clinical presentation became more severe in adulthood. One patient had spontaneous reeruption of 2 posterior teeth. Cervical root resorptions were observed in 3 members. Genetic analysis showed a deleterious heterozygous mutation in intron 9 of the PTH1R gene (c.639-2A>G) and diagnosed an additional affected member.\nThe long-term follow-up of PFE cases in this family permitted the following observations: (1) the onset occurred from the preemergence to the postemergence phases, (2) PFE appeared to be closely related to ankylosis, (3) affected teeth maintained the eruptive potential even in adulthood, (4) the earlier the onset the more severe the open bite, and (5) cervical root resorptions occurred in 3 affected members.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005711","authors":["Cl\u00e1udia Misue Kanno","Jos\u00e9 Am\u00e9rico de Oliveira","Jos\u00e9 Fernando Garcia","Helmut Roth","Bernhard H.F.
