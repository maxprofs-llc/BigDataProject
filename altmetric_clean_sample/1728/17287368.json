Support and understanding of mothers is invaluable in enabling children with epilepsy to develop normal life skills in living with epilepsy. In order to identify the educational needs of mothers of children with epilepsy, their knowledge, attitudes, and practices should be assessed. Therefore, we interviewed a group of mothers of children with epilepsy who were referred to a pediatric neurology clinic in a teaching hospital. The objective of this study was to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices among mothers of children with epilepsy in order to identify their educational needs.\nIn the period of August 2014 to January 2015, mothers whose children were diagnosed with epilepsy for at least six months participated in this cross sectional study, while returning to the neurology clinic of a pediatric hospital for usual follow-up. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews, held by trained female general practitioners. The interviewer used questions from a questionnaire. The knowledge section of the questionnaire included questions regarding prevalence and general knowledge about epilepsy, its etiology, symptoms, and seizure provoking factors. The attitudes section included statements regarding the mother's attitudes towards epilepsy and patients with the disease. The practice section included questions about first-aid measures taken by mothers who had witnessed generalized seizures by the time of interview.\nResponses of 206 participants were analyzed. At least 83% of mothers knew that epilepsy is a noncontagious neurological disorder which can be treated by regular drug therapy. In spite of demonstrating good knowledge scores, the majority of mothers felt the need for further training in epilepsy. More than 98% of mothers were against the idea that patients with epilepsy should hide their disease. Though having been referred to physicians, 84% of mothers had provided their children with at least one ineffective treatment, mostly based on superstitions.\nMothers' level of knowledge of epilepsy was good, and their attitudes towards epilepsy were mainly positive. Regarding the right first-aid measures at time of the last seizure, mothers' practices were acceptable. However, there is still room for improvement regarding avoiding the wrong measures. It is suggested that both practice-related issues and other aspects of epilepsy be taken into account in epilepsy-related education programs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f5","authors":["Ali-Asghar Kolahi","Mohsen Abbasi-Kangevari","Pouya Bakhshaei","Farhad Mahvelati-Shamsabadi","Seyed-Hassan Tonekaboni","Ahmad-Reza Farsar"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.yebeh.2016.10.018","first_seen_on":"2017-03-12T12:43:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["15255050","1525-5069"],"journal":"Epilepsy & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1489336092,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1525505016303560"],"pmid":"28285235","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","neurology"],"title":"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices among mothers of children with epilepsy: A study in a teaching hospital","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1525505016303560","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/knowledge-attitudes-practices-among-mothers-children-epilepsy-study-teaching-hospital-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":1.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8348788,"mean":7.0413328717018,"rank":4422808,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3897466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8348788,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242139,"mean":13.686528599393,"rank":137142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":103575,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242139,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1467,"mean":4.1308199181446,"rank":820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":643,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1467,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":4.6132666666667,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
