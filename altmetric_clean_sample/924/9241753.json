An organized atrial arrhythmia of varying duration was seen to precede the AF in all patients. The earliest atrial activity during this organized rhythm was near the coronary sinus ostium (CS OS) in 14 patients and along the left side of the interatrial septum (IAS) in 3 patients. RFA was performed in 16 patients (14 near the CS OS and 2 along the IAS). Postablation AF was inducible in 1 patient in whom RFA was preformed near the CS OS and in both patients when it was performed along the IAS. At a follow-up of 6 to 56 weeks (mean, 32 weeks), 10 of the 13 patients who had successful ablation were in sinus rhythm. All patients in whom AF was reinducible immediately after RFA continue to be in AF.\nInduced AF in patients with rheumatic heart disease begins as a rapid organized arrhythmia with earliest atrial activity near the CS OS in most patients. RFA targeting the region of the CS OS is successful in suppressing the arrhythmia immediately in most of the patients and in most on follow-up.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057f2","authors":["Mohan Nair","Prasad Shah","Ravinder Batra","Manoj Kumar","Jagdish Mohan","Upkar Kaul","Ramesh Arora"],"doi":"10.1161\/hc3201.094228","endpage":"809","first_seen_on":"2016-07-05T16:10:18+00:00","issns":["1524-4539"],"issue":"7","journal":"Circulation","last_mentioned_on":1467726892,"links":["http:\/\/circ.ahajournals.org\/content\/circulationaha\/104\/7\/802.full.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/circ.ahajournals.org\/content\/circulationaha\/104\/7\/802.full.pdf","pmid":"11502706","pubdate":"2001-08-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Heart Association Journals","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"802","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Chronic Atrial Fibrillation in Patients With Rheumatic Heart Disease: Mapping and Radiofrequency Ablation of Flutter Circuits Seen at Initiation After Cardioversion","type":"article","volume":"104","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chronic-atrial-fibrillation-patients-rheumatic-heart-disease-mapping-radiofrequency-ablation-flutter"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":3071456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4910143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260267,"mean":11.510799720286,"rank":87110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":172465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260267,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8839,"mean":16.811902692917,"rank":5387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":3443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8839,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151,"mean":64.316933333333,"rank":99,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":3,"Other":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"US":2,"FR":1,"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DebbeMcCall\/statuses\/750283307045314561","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9241753],"posted_on":"2016-07-05T11:00:54+00:00","author":{"name":"Debbe McCall","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/AtrialFibrillationSupportForum\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/870779514007076864\/a9ZD1_f4_normal.jpg","description":"Cardiovascular patient researcher & advocate, Patient-PI\/Chair for Health eHeart Alliance PPRN, DSMB, StopAFib volunteer, Pt Rep for FDA","id_on_source":"DebbeMcCall","tweeter_id":"2328827605","geo":{"lt":37.25022,"ln":-119.75126,"country":"US"},"followers":7853},"tweet_id":"750283307045314561"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/H_eHA\/statuses\/750285655293427713","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9241753],"posted_on":"2016-07-05T11:10:14+00:00","author":{"name":"HealtheHeartAlliance","url":"http:\/\/health-eheartalliance.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/527193496319299584\/CFdmGj7W_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"H_eHA","tweeter_id":"2880831056","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":6505},"tweet_id":"750285655293427713"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RhEACHout\/statuses\/750299853779968000","license":"gnip","rt":["DebbeMcCall"],"citation_ids":[9241753],"posted_on":"2016-07-05T12:06:39+00:00","author":{"name":"RhEACH","url":"http:\/\/www.rheach.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000169699824\/f795dd6ee3e54af72e31051aeab97096_normal.jpeg","description":"RhEACH is a technical support & policy translation initiative to amplify rheumatic heart disease control efforts worldwide.
