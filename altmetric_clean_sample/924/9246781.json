To date, there is no population-based estimation of how many people seek SOs and what the characteristics of second-opinion seekers are.\nTo estimate how many people seek SOs, and what the characteristics of second-opinion seekers are.\nWe conducted both a medical records analysis (n=1,392,907) and a cross-sectional national telephone survey with a representative sample of the general Israeli population (n=848, response rate=62%). In the medical records analysis, we linked consultations with specialists at community secondary care and private consultations using claims data. We developed a time-sensitive algorithm that identified potential SO instances. In both methods, we predicted the characteristics of second-opinion seekers using multivariate logistic regressions.\nThe medical records analysis and the survey findings were highly consistent, and showed that about sixth (14.9% in the medical records vs. 17.2% in the survey) of a general population sought a SO, mostly from orthopedic surgeons. Women, native-born, and established immigrants, people living in central urban areas or close to central urban areas, people with chronic conditions, and those who perceived their health status as not very good, were more likely to seek SOs than others.\nA considerable amount of people sought a SO. Certain patient profiles tended to seek SOs more than others. Such utilization patterns are important to devise policy regarding SOs, due to their implications on expenditure, policy, clinical outcomes, and patient satisfaction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b18","authors":["Shmueli, Liora","Shmueli, Erez","Pliskin, Joseph S","Balicer, Ran D","Davidovitch, Nadav","Hekselman, Igal","Greenfield, Geva","Pliskin, Joseph S.","Balicer, Ran D."],"doi":"10.1097\/mlr.0000000000000567","endpage":"928","first_seen_on":"2016-07-05T17:19:34+00:00","issns":["1537-1948","0025-7079"],"issue":"10","journal":"Medical care","last_mentioned_on":1474460519,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27213545","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/lww-medicalcare\/Abstract\/2016\/10000\/Second_Medical_Opinion__Utilization_Rates_and.5.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/lww-medicalcare\/Fulltext\/2016\/10000\/Second_Medical_Opinion__Utilization_Rates_and.5.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/lww-medicalcare\/2016\/10000\/Second_Medical_Opinion__Utilization_Rates_and.5.pdf","pmid":"27213545","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Second Medical Opinion","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/lww-medicalcare\/Fulltext\/2016\/10000\/Second_Medical_Opinion__Utilization_Rates_and.5.aspx","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/second-medical-opinion-utilization-rates-characteristics-seekers-general-population"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":3658552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4635112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263516,"mean":11.700135400261,"rank":105121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":153686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263516,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2607,"mean":7.6897874136608,"rank":1728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2607,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":8.4905098039216,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Imperial_PCPH\/statuses\/750335836466647040","license":"gnip","rt":["GevaGreenfield"],"citation_ids":[9246781],"posted_on":"2016-07-05T14:29:38+00:00","author":{"name":"PCPH","url":"http:\/\/www1.imperial.ac.uk\/publichealth\/departments\/pcph\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/603565457417830400\/MdOYgvMT_normal.jpg","description":"Department of Primary Care and Public Health (PCPH) at Imperial College London @ImperialSPH @ImperialCollege.","id_on_source":"Imperial_PCPH","tweeter_id":"3300510238","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":1131},"tweet_id":"750335836466647040"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/GevaGreenfield\/statuses\/750322792793575424","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9246781],"posted_on":"2016-07-05T13:37:48+00:00","author":{"name":"Geva Greenfield","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/748874153344761856\/0Mx3K-NM_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"GevaGreenfield","tweeter_id":"746320549392097280","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":28},"tweet_id":"750322792793575424"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MedicalCareLWW\/statuses\/778569939112255488","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9246781],"posted_on":"2016-09-21T12:21:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Medical Care","url":"http:\/\/www.lww-medicalcare.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/765556678167146496\/6IZOVitz_normal.jpg","description":"Devoted to all aspects of administration & delivery of healthcare.
