Loci in American Jews"],"citation":{"abstract":"The higher risk of pancreatic cancer in Ashkenazi Jews compared to non-Jews is only partially explained by the increased frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Ashkenazi Jews.\nWe evaluated the impact of 16 established pancreatic cancer susceptibility loci in a case-control sample of American Jews, largely Ashkenazi, including 406 full-Jewish pancreatic cancer patients and 2,332 full-Jewish controls, genotyped as part of the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort and Case-Control Consortium I\/II (PanScan I\/II), Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanC4), and Resource for Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) data sets. We compared risk in full-Jewish subjects to risk in part-Jewish, non-Jewish Southern European, and in the combined non-Jewish Eastern, Northern, Southern, and Western European (non-Jewish white-European) subjects from the same data sets. Jewish ancestries were genetically identified using seeded Fast principal component analysis. Data were analyzed by unconditional logistic regression, and adjusted for age, sex, and principal components (PCs).\nOne SNP on chromosome 13q22.1 (rs9543325, OR=1.36, 95% CI=1.16-1.58, P=10^-4.1) was significant in full-Jews. Individual ORs and minor allele frequencies were similar between Jewish and non-Jewish white-European subjects. The average ORs across the 16 pancreatic cancer susceptibility loci for full-Jewish, full- plus part-Jewish, non-Jewish Southern European, and non-Jewish white-European subjects were 1.25, 1.30, 1.31, and 1.26, respectively.\nThe 16 pancreatic cancer susceptibility loci similarly impact Jewish and non-Jewish white-European subjects, both individually and as summary odds.\nThese 16 pancreatic cancer susceptibility loci likely do not explain the higher risk seen in Ashkenazi Jews.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dcc","authors":["Streicher, Samantha A.","Klein, Alison P.","Olson, Sara H.","Amundadottir, Laufey T.","DeWan, Andrew T.","Zhao, Hongyu","Risch, Harvey A.","Samantha A.
