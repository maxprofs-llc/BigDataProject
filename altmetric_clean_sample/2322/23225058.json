In this study, we demonstrate that groove-ridge structures with a periodicity in the submicrometer range induce elongation of iPSC colonies, guide the orientation of apical actin fibers, and direct the polarity of cell division. Elongation of iPSC colonies impacts also on their intrinsic molecular patterning, which seems to be orchestrated from the rim of the colonies. BMP4-induced differentiation is enhanced in elongated colonies, and the submicron grooves impact on the spatial modulation of YAP activity upon induction with this morphogen. Interestingly, TAZ, a YAP paralog, shows distinct cytoskeletal localization in iPSCs. These findings demonstrate that topography can guide orientation and organization of iPSC colonies, which may affect the interaction between mechanosensors and mechanotransducers in iPSCs.","altmetric_jid":"52d5438d3cf05876028b4567","authors":["Abagnale, Giulio","Sechi, Antonio","Steger, Michael","Zhou, Qihui","Kuo, Chao-Chung","Aydin, G\u00fclcan","Schalla, Carmen","M\u00fcller-Newen, Gerhard","Zenke, Martin","Costa, Ivan G.","van Rijn, Patrick","Gillner, Arnold","Wagner, Wolfgang","Giulio Abagnale","Antonio Sechi","Michael Steger","Qihui Zhou","Chao-Chung Kuo","G\u00fclcan Aydin","Carmen Schalla","Gerhard M\u00fcller-Newen","Martin Zenke","Ivan G.
