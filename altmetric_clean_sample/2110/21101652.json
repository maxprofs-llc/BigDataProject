However, the mechanisms for regulating TCRP1 expression remain unclear. Herein, we combined bioinformatics analysis with luciferase reporter assay and ChIP assay to determine that c-Myc could directly bind to TCRP1 promoter to upregulate its expression. TCRP1 upregulation in multidrug resistant tongue cancer cells (Tca8113\/PYM) and cisplatin-resistant A549 lung cancer cells (A549\/DDP) was accompanied by c-Myc upregulation, compared to respective parental cells. In tongue and lung cancer cells, siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Myc led to decrease TCRP1 expression, whereas overexpression c-Myc did the opposite. Moreover, TCRP1 knockdown attenuated chemoresistance resulting from c-Myc overexpression, but TCRP1 overexpression impaired the effect of c-Myc knockdown on chemosensitivity. Additionally, in both human tongue and lung cancer tissues, c-Myc protein expression positively correlated with TCRP1 protein expression and these protein levels were associated with worse prognosis for patients. Combined, these findings suggest that c-Myc could transcriptionally regulate TCRP1 in cell lines and clinical samples and identified the c-Myc-TCRP1 axis as a negative biomarker of prognosis in tongue and lung cancers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Xiaoting Jia","Zhijie Zhang","Kai Luo","Guopei Zheng","Minying Lu","Ying Song","Hao Liu","Huisi Qiu","Zhimin He"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-03763-0","first_seen_on":"2017-06-16T09:07:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1497603923,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-03763-0?WT.feed_name=subjects_cancer&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-03763-0.pdf","pmid":"28623290","pubdate":"2017-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"3744","subjects":["science"],"title":"TCRP1 transcriptionally regulated by c-Myc confers cancer chemoresistance in tongue and lung cancer","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tcrp1-transcriptionally-regulated-cmyc-confers-cancer-chemoresistance-tongue-lung-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":7244360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":219740,"mean":13.12864052353,"rank":180478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":219740,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37143,"mean":14.723250659631,"rank":30955,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37143,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3254,"mean":15.669783584384,"rank":2596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3254,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChpHealthcare\/statuses\/875640435175079936","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21101652],"posted_on":"2017-06-16T09:05:23+00:00","author":{"name":"ChpHealthcare.com","url":"http:\/\/www.chphealthcare.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/535842796460965888\/hR1KY45G_normal.png","id_on_source":"ChpHealthcare","tweeter_id":"2905419084","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":256},"tweet_id":"875640435175079936"}]}}
