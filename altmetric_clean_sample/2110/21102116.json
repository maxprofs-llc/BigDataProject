Its association with hypercalcemia has been reported in 19 neonates since 1926. The two occur in full-term to postterm newborns with perinatal complications associated with delivery. Erythematous to violaceous, firm, subcutaneous nodules appear approximately 1 to 4 weeks after delivery, preceding the development of signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia. Although SCFN and hypercalcemia are rare complications in neonates with perinatal problems, death due to the sequelae of hypercalcemia occurred in 3 of the 19 patients. A neonate who develops skin lesions consistent with SCFN should be followed for possible onset of hypercalcemia and treated in a timely fashion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032ac","authors":["Hicks, M J","Levy, M L","Alexander, J","Flaitz, C M"],"first_seen_on":"2017-06-16T09:33:35+00:00","issns":["0736-8046"],"issue":"3","journal":"Pediatric Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1497605601,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8415307"],"pmid":"8415307","pubdate":"1993-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology","pediatrics"],"title":"Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn and hypercalcemia: case report and review of the literature.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/subcutaneous-fat-necrosis-newborn-hypercalcemia-case-report-review-literature-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":4472496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2332085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":219741,"mean":13.128579639574,"rank":122867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":76403,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":219741,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":957,"mean":3.4688493723849,"rank":508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":957,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":1.8811475409836,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IowaguruHicks\/statuses\/875647475037593602","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21102116],"posted_on":"2017-06-16T09:33:21+00:00","author":{"name":"john hicks","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/848240086907060228\/m0Q4HPgP_normal.jpg","description":"Pediatric Pathologist at Texas Children's Hospital","id_on_source":"IowaguruHicks","tweeter_id":"3140502722","geo":{"lt":29.76328,"ln":-95.36327,"country":"US"},"followers":55},"tweet_id":"875647475037593602"}]}}
