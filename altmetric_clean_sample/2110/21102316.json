A conditional inference tree method was used to fit a binary decision tree predicting operative time. Permutation tests were performed to determine the variables having the strongest association with surgical time. The data was split at the value of this variable resulting in the largest difference in means for the surgical time across the split. This process was repeated recursively on the resultant data sets until the permutation tests showed no significant association with operative time.\n2134 procedures were included. The variable most strongly associated with surgical time was type of diversion (ileal conduits - 70 minutes shorter, p<0.001). Among patients who received neobladders, type of lymph node dissection was also strongly associated with surgical time. Among Ileal conduit patients, institutional surgeon volume (>66 RARCs) was important (higher volume-55 minutes shorter, p<0.001). The regression tree output was in the form of box plots that show the median and ranges of surgical times according to the patient, disease and institutional characteristics CONCLUSION: We developed a methodology to estimate operative times for RARC based on patient, disease and institutional metrics that can help operating room scheduling for RARC.
