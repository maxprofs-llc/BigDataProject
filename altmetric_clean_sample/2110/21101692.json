Using an HLA-A*02-restricted cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65-derived immunogenic peptide, we found that the more dominant pp65-specific TCR clonotypes in the blood of healthy donors have higher binding affinities for the CMV peptide and arise from clonotypes that are highly shared among individuals. Interestingly, these highly shared HLA-A*02-restricted CMV-specific TCRs were detected in a CMV-seronegative individual as well as in HLA-A*02-negative donors albeit at lower frequency. More intriguingly, these shared TCR clonotypes were abundant in the stem memory T-cell subset, and TCR diversity of the stem memory T-cell repertoire was significantly lower than in the central memory and effector memory T-cell repertoires. These results suggest that the stem memory T-cell subset may serve as a reservoir of highly shared and highly functional memory T-cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Takahiko Miyama","Takakazu Kawase","Kazutaka Kitaura","Ren Chishaki","Masashi Shibata","Kumi Oshima","Hiroshi Hamana","Hiroyuki Kishi","Atsushi Muraguchi","Kiyotaka Kuzushima","Hiroh Saji","Tadasu Shin-I","Ryuji Suzuki","Tatsuo Ichinohe"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-03855-x","first_seen_on":"2017-06-16T09:08:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1498226783,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-03855-x?WT.feed_name=subjects_next-generation-sequencing&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28623251?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/s41598-017-03855-x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-03855-x.pdf","pmid":"28623251","pubdate":"2017-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"3663","subjects":["science"],"title":"Highly functional T-cell receptor repertoires are abundant in stem memory T cells and highly shared among individuals","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highly-functional-tcell-receptor-repertoires-abundant-stem-memory-t-cells-highly-shared-among-indivi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":3.5,"6m":3.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435853,"mean":7.0940247306295,"rank":2012677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6384985,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435853,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222085,"mean":13.204273292988,"rank":69872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":151503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222085,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37708,"mean":14.743490280319,"rank":12422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":25113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37708,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3259,"mean":15.815020257827,"rank":1103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":2145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3259,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":8}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
