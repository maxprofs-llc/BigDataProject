The purpose of this study was to: (1) investigate the behavioral requirements for exercise habit formation, (2) how Dual Process approach predicts behaviour, and (3) what predicts habit by testing a model (Lally and Gardner in Health Psychol Rev 7:S137-S158, 2013). Participants (n\u00a0=\u00a0111) were new gym members who completed surveys across 12\u00a0weeks. It was found that exercising for at least four bouts per week for 6\u00a0weeks was the minimum requirement to establish an exercise habit. Dual Process analysis using Linear Mixed Models (LMM) revealed habit and intention to be parallel predictors of exercise behavior in the trajectory analysis. Finally, the habit antecedent model in LLM showed that consistency (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0.21), low behavioral complexity (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0.19), environment (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0.17) and affective judgments (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0.13) all significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) predicted changes in habit formation over time. Trainers should keep exercises fun and simple for new clients and focus on consistency which could lead to habit formation in nearly 6\u00a0weeks.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc0","authors":["Navin Kaushal","Ryan E.
