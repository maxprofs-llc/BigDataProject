CT data were sent for post-processing and output to the 3D printer to create kidney models with tumor. By presenting to experienced laparoscopic urologists and patients, respectively, the models' realism, effectiveness for surgical planning and training, and patients' comprehension of disease and procedure were evaluated with plotted questionnaires (10-point rating scales, 1-not at all useful\/not at all realistic\/poor, 10-very useful\/very realistic\/excellent). The size of resected tumors was compared with that on the models.\nTen kidney models of such patients were fabricated successfully. The overall effectiveness in surgical planning and training (7.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7-8.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1), and realism (6.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6-7.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0) were reached by four invited urologists. Intraoperative correlation was advocated by the two performing urologists. Patients were fascinated with the demonstration of a tactile \"diseased organ\" (average \u22659.0). The size deviation was 3.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0mm.\nGenerating kidney models of T1N0M0 tumors with 3D printing are feasible with refinements to be performed. Face and content validity was obtained when those models were presented to experienced urologists for making practical planning and training. Understandings of the disease and procedure from patients were well appreciated with this novel technology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003742","authors":["Yi Zhang","Hong-wei Ge","Ning-chen Li","Cheng-fan Yu","Hong-feng Guo","Shi-hua Jin","Jin-shun Liu","Yan-qun Na"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00345-015-1530-7","first_seen_on":"2015-04-09T14:10:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1433-8726"],"issue":"4","journal":"World Journal of Urology","last_mentioned_on":1460332800,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00345-015-1530-7","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25841361","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00345-015-1530-7"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00345-015-1530-7.pdf","pmid":"25841361","pubdate":"2015-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nephrology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Urology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Evaluation of three-dimensional printing for laparoscopic partial nephrectomy of renal tumors: a preliminary report.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-threedimensional-printing-laparoscopic-partial-nephrectomy-renal-tumors-preliminary-repor-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7529066,"mean":6.5069445313556,"rank":3045011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4436691,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7529066,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199986,"mean":9.0940644048305,"rank":75048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":122651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199986,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":507,"mean":4.2974782608696,"rank":233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":507,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":4.5311428571429,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":3,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/725423092","license":"public","citation_ids":[3892694],"posted_on":"2016-04-11T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["good_for_teaching"],"f1000_score":"1"}],"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DouglasMataMD\/status\/586173761914810368","license":"datasift","rt":["NatRevUrol"],"citation_ids":[3892694],"posted_on":"2015-04-09T14:28:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Douglas Mata","url":"http:\/\/www.douglasmata.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/588072378065780736\/RbqDhaCQ_normal.jpg","description":"Resident physician in pathology at Brigham and Women's Hospital and clinical fellow at Harvard University.
