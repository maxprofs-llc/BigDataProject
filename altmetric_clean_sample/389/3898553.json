The occurrence of pleomorphic adenoma of the tongue base is very rare, and very few cases have been reported in the literature. Objective\u2003The authors present a rare case of pleomorphic adenoma of the tongue base and a review of the literature. Case Report\u2003A 55-year-old woman had an extensive cervical mass, with little pain, from the submental level to the level below the hyoid bone. Fiberoptic endoscopic examination showed an extensive mass at the base of the tongue with considerable reduction in the airway. Magnetic resonance image scan revealed a contrast-enhancing mass of heterogeneous density over the base of the tongue of 8\u2009\u00d7\u20098\u2009\u00d7\u20097 cm and a reduction of the hypopharyngeal airway. Biopsy of the lesion was performed along with a tracheostomy due to the bulging tongue base and acute respiratory failure. Histologic examination with an immunohistochemistry study revealed a diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma. The excision of the tumor was performed by a lateral pharyngotomy approach and the total mass was excised. Conclusion\u2003The authors consider the rarity of this case and show that this is the 11th and the largest pleomorphic adenoma reported in the English-language medical literature.","altmetric_jid":"5458d1652a83eee2498b457e","authors":["Luiz Augusto Nascimento","Thais Gon\u00e7alves Pinheiro Vilela"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0033-1351683","first_seen_on":"2015-04-11T09:07:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1809-9777","1809-4864"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Archives of Otorhinolaryngology","last_mentioned_on":1432244410,"links":["https:\/\/www.thieme-connect.com\/products\/ejournals\/abstract\/10.1055\/s-0033-1351683","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25992116?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25992116","pubdate":"2013-11-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Thieme Publica\u00e7\u00f5es Ltda","title":"Pleomorphic adenoma of the tongue base: case report and review.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pleomorphic-adenoma-tongue-base-case-report-review-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5128650,"mean":6.0687045960854,"rank":2530590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2444250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5128650,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153945,"mean":10.013685210206,"rank":81330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":66210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153945,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228,"mean":0.58480176211454,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":0.63333333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Pleomorphic Adenoma of the Tongue Base","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=908693199175123&id=593411467369966","license":"public","citation_ids":[3898553],"posted_on":"2015-02-26T17:14:06+00:00","summary":"https:\/\/www.thieme-connect.com\/products\/ejournals\/abstract\/10.1055\/s-0033-1351683","author":{"name":"International Archives of Otorhinolaryngology","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/593411467369966","facebook_wall_name":"International Archives of Otorhinolaryngology","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/593411467369966\/picture","id_on_source":"593411467369966"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/status\/601502770986811393","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3898553],"posted_on":"2015-05-21T21:40:10+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":388},"tweet_id":"601502770986811393"}]}}
