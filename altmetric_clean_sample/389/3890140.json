Peritraumatic tonic immobility has been reported in convenience samples of female victims of sexual assault and in mixed-gender victims of different types of trauma. This study evaluated peritraumatic tonic immobility in a representative general population sample and its association with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and gender.\n3231 victims of traumatic events aged 15-75 years responded to the Tonic Immobility Scale. PTSD and traumatic events were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2.1). We calculated the means and the standard deviations of Tonic Immobility Scale scores stratified by PTSD and gender. The association between tonic immobility scores and gender was explored controlling for potential confounders through a multiple linear regression model.\nTonic immobility scores were more than double in those who met criteria for PTSD and were almost four points higher in women. Gender differences remained statistically significant even after adjustment for confounding variables.\nThe cross-sectional and retrospective design may have given rise to recall bias. Results presented here may not apply to small and medium rural areas and the CIDI 2.1 can lead to a certain degree of misclassification.\nWe have expanded the scope of previous investigations on peritraumatic tonic immobility which were based on convenience samples only, showing its occurrence in victims of traumatic events using a large representative sample of the general population. Furthermore, we confirmed in an unbiased sample the association between peritraumatic tonic immobility and PTSD and female gender.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000582e","authors":["Kalaf, Juliana","Vilete, Liliane Maria Pereira","Volchan, Eliane","Fiszman, Adriana","Coutinho, Evandro Silva Freire","Andreoli, Sergio Baxter","Quintana, Maria In\u00eas","de Jesus Mari, Jair","Figueira, Ivan","Juliana Kalaf","Liliane Maria Pereira Vilete","Eliane Volchan","Adriana Fiszman","Evandro Silva Freire Coutinho","Sergio Baxter Andreoli","Maria In\u00eas Quintana","Jair de Jesus Mari","Ivan Figueira"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.comppsych.2015.04.001","first_seen_on":"2015-04-09T01:00:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0010-440X","1532-8384","0010440X"],"journal":"Comprehensive Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1428541233,"links":["http:\/\/www.comppsychjournal.com\/article\/S0010-440X(15)00050-4\/abstract?rss=yes","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=3&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.comppsychjournal.com%2Farticle%2FS0010-440X%2815%2900050-4%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=ycomp-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=3&redirect=http:\/\/www.comppsychjournal.com\/article\/S0010-440X(15)00050-4\/abstract?rss=yes&code=ycomp-site","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0010440X15000504","https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/275060504_Peritraumatic_tonic_immobility_in_a_large_representative_sample_of_the_general_population_Association_with_posttraumatic_stress_disorder_and_female_gender"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.comppsychjournal.com\/article\/S0010440X15000504\/pdf","pmid":"25891640","pubdate":"2015-04-22T22:07:12+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Peritraumatic tonic immobility in a large representative sample of the general population: association with posttraumatic stress disorder and female gender","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/peritraumatic-tonic-immobility-large-representative-sample-general-population-association-posttrauma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5577294,"mean":6.3900005063409,"rank":3934937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":931798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5577294,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161793,"mean":10.105782745748,"rank":117300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":26549,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161793,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":946,"mean":2.742744973545,"rank":711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":946,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":2.4395833333333,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
