Following biopsy\/resection, patients received three identical cycles of Induction chemotherapy (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin) administered every 21-28\u00a0days. Patients without tumor progression then received three consolidation cycles of marrow-ablative chemotherapy (thiotepa and carboplatin) followed by autologous hematopoietic cell rescue.\nThe maximum tolerated dose of thiotepa was 10\u00a0mg\/kg\/day\u00a0\u00d7 2\u00a0days per cycle. The toxic mortality rate was zero during induction and 2.6% during consolidation. Centrally evaluated response rates to induction and consolidation in evaluable patients with residual tumor were 73.3% and 66.7%, respectively. Disease progression rates on induction and consolidation were 4%. Five-year event-free survival and overall survival were 43.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2% and 63.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% respectively. Gross total resection versus\u00a0less than gross total resection were the only significant outcome comparisons: 5-year maximum tolerated dose and overall survival of 54.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07% versus 28.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0065) and 75.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08% versus 48.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0034), respectively. The 5-year maximum tolerated dose for localized (M0) versus metastatic (M1+) medulloblastoma was 67.5 \u00b1 9.5% versus 30 \u00b1 14.5% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007). The 5-year maximum tolerated dose and overall survival for desmoplastic medulloblastoma patients versus other medulloblastoma were 78.6 \u00b1 11% versus 50.5 \u00b1 12% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.038) and 85.7 \u00b1 9.4% versus 60.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.6% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.046), respectively.\nThis phase I dose-escalation study of marrow-ablative thiotepa regimen determined a maximum tolerated dose that had acceptable toxicity. Overall survival data justify this strategy for current Children's Oncology Group studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032b1","authors":["Cohen, Bruce H","Geyer, J Russell","Miller, Douglas C","Curran, John G","Zhou, Tianni","Holmes, Emi","Ingles, Sue Ann","Dunkel, Ira J","Hilden, Joanne","Packer, Roger J","Pollack, Ian F","Gajjar, Amar","Finlay, Jonathan L",", "],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pediatrneurol.2015.03.019","endpage":"46","first_seen_on":"2015-04-09T01:29:31+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["0887-8994","1873-5150","08878994"],"issue":"1","journal":"Pediatric Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1459266191,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pedneur.com%2Farticle%2FS0887-8994%252815%252900159-9%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=pnu-site","http:\/\/www.pedneur.com\/article\/S0887-8994(15)00159-9\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26092413?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pedneur.com\/article\/S0887899415001599\/pdf","pmid":"26092413","pubdate":"2015-06-21T22:08:43+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"31","subjects":["neurology","pediatrics"],"title":"Pilot Study of Intensive Chemotherapy with Peripheral Hematopoietic Cell Support for Children Less than 3 Years of Age with Malignant Brain Tumors, The CCG-99703 Phase I\/II Study.
