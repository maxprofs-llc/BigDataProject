Proteolytic processing of APP and its physiological function depend on its interaction with heparin and are influenced by the binding of metal ions and sorLA. We created various mutations of the metal binding site M1 residing within the extracellular E2-domain of APP. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy we analyzed the binding of Cu2+ and Zn2+ to APP-E2 and identified two mutations that are most suited for functional studies to dissect ion specific effects of metal binding. Our mutation H313A only abrogates copper-based effects, whereas H382A diminishes any metal binding at M1 of APP-E2. Subsequently, we tested the effect of Cu2+ and Zn2+ on the binding of heparin and sorLA to APP-E2 using a chromatographic technique and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). We show that Zn2+ and to a larger degree also Cu2+ enhance the binding of heparin to APP-E2, consistent with an extracellular regulation of the function of APP by both metal ions. In contrast, neither ion seemed to affect the interaction between APP-E2 and sorLA. This supports an intracellular interaction between the latter two partners that would not sense extracellular variations of metal ions upon synaptic activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["Dienemann, Christian","Coburger, Ina","Mehmedbasic, Arnela","Andersen, Olav M","Than, Manuel E"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.biochem.5b00111","first_seen_on":"2015-04-11T02:58:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-4995"],"journal":"Biochemistry (00062979)","last_mentioned_on":1435688886,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25835329","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25835329?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25835329","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Mutants of the metal binding site M1 in APP-E2 show metal-specific differences in binding of heparin but not of sorLA.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mutants-metal-binding-site-m1-app-e2-show-metal-specific-differences-binding-heparin-not-sorla"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5296399,"mean":6.2230054757991,"rank":472978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4817892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5296399,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156230,"mean":10.085574112361,"rank":22893,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":133094,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156230,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5859,"mean":2.5528074428132,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":5814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5859,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":1.8338983050847,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
