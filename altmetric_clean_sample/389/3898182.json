Up to 20\u00a0% of these patients will progress to necrotizing pancreatitis requiring intervention. The aim of this study is to identify specific preoperative factors for the development of Clavien 4 complications and mortality in patients undergoing pancreatic necrosectomy.\nThe American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) participant use files were reviewed from 2007 to 2012 to identify patients who underwent a pancreatic necrosectomy. Postoperative complications were stratified into Clavien 4 (ICU level complications) and Clavien 5 (mortality). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.\nA total of 1156 patients underwent a pancreatic necrosectomy from 2007 to 2012. Overall, 42\u00a0% of patients experienced a Clavien 4 complication. Mortality rate was 9.5\u00a0%. Nonindependent functional status and ASA class were highly significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in univariate analysis. Frailty and emergency surgery status (p\u2009<\u20090.001), as well as increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and alkaline phosphatase and decreased albumin (p\u2009<\u20090.05) demonstrated independent significance of Clavien 4 complications and mortality in multivariate analysis.\nThis study identified specific preoperative variables that place patients at increased risk of Clavien 4 complications and mortality after necrosectomy. Identification of high-risk patients can aid in selection of appropriate treatment strategies and allow for informed preoperative discussion regarding surgical risk.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db8","authors":["Nina Kolbe","Stephanie Bakey","Lisa Louwers","Dionne Blyden","Mathilda Horst","Anthony Falvo","Joe Patton","Ilan Rubinfeld"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11605-015-2815-2","first_seen_on":"2015-04-11T04:45:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-4626"],"journal":"Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1428727549,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11605-015-2815-2"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11605-015-2815-2.pdf","pmid":"25862000","pubdate":"2015-04-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","gastroenterology"],"title":"Predictors of Clavien 4 Complications and Mortality After Necrosectomy: Analysis of the NSQIP Database","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predictors-clavien-4-complications-mortality-after-necrosectomy-analysis-nsqip-database"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4982174,"mean":5.8952805183638,"rank":4165309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4982174,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150635,"mean":9.9993830874837,"rank":126129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150635,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":799,"mean":1.5645238095238,"rank":496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":799,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":1.0098039215686,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
