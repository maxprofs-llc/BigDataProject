The key outcome measures were a modified Rankin Scale score \u22642 (functional independence) and the Euro-QoL EQ-5D, a health-related quality-of-life measure.\n656 subjects with moderate-to-severe stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale \u22658) were enrolled at 58 centers in the United States (41 sites), Canada (7), Australia (4), and Europe (6). There was an interaction between treatment group and stroke severity in the repeated measures analysis of modified Rankin Scale \u22642 outcome (P=0.039). In the 204 participants with severe stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale \u226520), a greater proportion of the endovascular group had a modified Rankin Scale \u22642 (32.5%) at 12 months as compared with the intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator group (18.6%, P=0.037); no difference was seen for the 452 participants with moderately severe strokes (55.6% versus 57.7%). In participants with severe stroke, the endovascular group had 35.2 (95% confidence interval: 2.1, 73.3) more quality-adjusted-days over 12 months as compared with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator alone.\nEndovascular therapy improves functional outcome and health-related quality-of-life at 12 months after severe ischemic stroke.\nURL: http:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov.
