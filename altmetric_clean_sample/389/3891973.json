The purpose of this study was to examine the association between TV viewing and physical activity in 10-year old Brazilian children.\nThe sample consisted of 485 children. Self-reported TV viewing on weekdays and weekends was assessed by questionnaire. An Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometer was used to monitor the range of physical activity intensities (including moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; MVPA), sedentary behavior (SB) and steps\/day over 7 days.\nDaily MVPA was highest among children viewing TV <1 hour\/day (69 min) compared to children viewing 1-2 hours\/day (61 min), 3-4 hours\/day (55 min) and \u22655 hours\/day (59 min) on weekdays (p=0.0015). Differences in MVPA were not observed across TV categories on weekends. The prevalence of reaching 60 min\/day of MVPA and 12,000 steps\/day on weekdays was significantly greater in children viewing \u22642 hours\/day (51.7% and 23.5%, respectively) compared to those viewing >2 hours\/day (38.6%, p=0.0058; and 15.1%, p=0.0291, respectively). There was no difference in SB across TV viewing categories.\nTime spent in MVPA and the frequency of meeting MVPA guidelines were significantly higher among children viewing \u22642 hours\/day of TV on weekdays compared to those viewing more.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007de9","authors":["Ferrari, Gerson Luis","Araujo, Timoteo Leandro","Oliveira, Luis","Matsudo, Victor","Mire, Emily","Barreira, Tiago V","Tudor-Locke, Catrine","Katzmarzyk, Peter T"],"doi":"10.1123\/jpah.2014-0406","first_seen_on":"2015-04-09T10:16:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1543-5474"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Activity and Health","last_mentioned_on":1428574464,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25831554"],"pmid":"25831554","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Association Between Television Viewing and Physical Activity in 10-year Old Brazilian Children.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-television-viewing-physical-activity-10yearold-brazilian-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4977898,"mean":5.8924309386106,"rank":2640822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1666870,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4977898,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150242,"mean":10.089024593819,"rank":87236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":47291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150242,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":335,"mean":6.3939820359281,"rank":169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":335,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.36,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
