This may have a limited impact on influencing care as clinically meaningful CD4 decline rarely occurs during viral suppression.\nIn a regional HIV observational cohort in the Asia-Pacific, patients with viral suppression (2 consecutive viral loads <400 copies\/mL) and a CD4 count \u2265200 cells\/\u00b5L who had CD4 testing 6 monthly were analyzed. Main study endpoints were occurrence of one CD4 count <200 cells\/\u00b5L (single CD4<200) and two CD4 counts <200 cells\/\u00b5L within a 6-month period (confirmed CD4<200). A comparison of time to single and confirmed CD4<200 with biannual or annual CD4 assessment was performed by generating a hypothetical group comprised of the same patients with annual CD4 testing by removing every second CD4 count.\nAmong 1538 patients, the rate of single CD4<200 was 3.45\/100 patient-years, and of confirmed CD4<200 was 0.77\/100 patient-years. During 5 years of viral suppression, patients with baseline CD4 200-249 cells\/\u00b5L were significantly more likely to experience confirmed CD4<200 compared with patients with higher baseline CD4 (hazard ratio 55.47 [95% confidence interval 7.36-418.20], p<0.001 versus baseline CD4 \u2265500 cells\/\u00b5L). Cumulative probabilities of confirmed CD4<200 was also higher in patients with baseline CD4 200-249 cells\/\u00b5L compared with patients with higher baseline CD4. There was no significant difference in time to confirmed CD4<200 between biannual and annual CD4 measurement (p=0.336).\nAnnual CD4 monitoring in virally suppressed HIV patients with a baseline CD4 \u2265250 cells\/\u00b5L may be sufficient for clinical management.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c37","authors":["Ahn, Jin Young","Boettiger, David","Law, Matthew","Kumarasamy, Nagalingeswaran","Yunihastuti, Evy","Chaiwarith, Romanee","Lee, Man Po","Sim, Benedict Lh","Oka, Shinichi","Wong, Wingwai","Kamarulzaman, Adeeba","Kantipong, Pacharee","Phanuphak, Praphan","Ng, Oon Tek","Kiertiburanakul, Sasisopin","Zhang, Fujie","Pujari, Sanjay","Ditangco, Rossana","Ratanasuwan, Winai","Merati, Tuti Parwati","Saphonn, Vonthanak","Sohn, Annette H","Choi, Jun Yong","Jin Young Ahn","David Boettiger","Matthew Law","Nagalingeswaran Kumarasamy","Evy Yunihastuti","Romanee Chaiwarith","Man Po Lee","Benedict L.
