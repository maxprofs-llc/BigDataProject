However, few studies have explored the validity of spinal palpatory exams. To evaluate the status of the current scientific evidence, we conducted a systematic review to assess the content validity of spinal palpatory tests used to identify spinal neuro-musculoskeletal dysfunction.\nReview of eleven databases and a hand search of peer-reviewed literature, published between 1965-2002, was undertaken. Two blinded reviewers abstracted pertinent data from the retrieved papers, using a specially developed quality-scoring instrument. Five papers met the inclusion\/exclusion criteria.\nThree of the five papers included in the review explored the content validity of motion tests. Two of these papers focused on identifying the level of fixation (decreased mobility) and one focused on range of motion. All three studies used a mechanical model as a reference standard. Two of the five papers included in the review explored the validity of pain assessment using the visual analogue scale or the subjects' own report as reference standards. Overall the sensitivity of studies looking at range of motion tests and pain varied greatly. Poor sensitivity was reported for range of motion studies regardless of the examiner's experience. A slightly better sensitivity (82%) was reported in one study that examined cervical pain.\nThe lack of acceptable reference standards may have contributed to the weak sensitivity findings. Given the importance of spinal palpatory tests as part of the spinal evaluation and treatment plan, effort is required by all involved disciplines to create well-designed and implemented studies in this area.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b0","authors":["Wadie I Najm","Michael A Seffinger","Shiraz I Mishra","Vivian M Dickerson","Alan Adams","Sibylle Reinsch","Linda S Murphy","Arnold F Goodman"],"doi":"10.1186\/1472-6882-3-1","first_seen_on":"2015-04-12T03:27:59+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1472-6882"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1426898366,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6882\/3\/1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6882-3-1.pdf","pmcid":"PMC156889","pmid":"12734016","pubdate":"2003-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chiropractic Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Complementary & Alternative Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Content validity of manual spinal palpatory exams - A systematic review","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/content-validity-manual-spinal-palpatory-exams-systematic-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4897794,"mean":5.8220491008929,"rank":4096663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4897794,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148950,"mean":9.9071272986058,"rank":124552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148950,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1542,"mean":4.5938961713173,"rank":1368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1542,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":4.5374769230769,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Student  > Ph.
