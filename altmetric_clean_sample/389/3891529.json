Then, reproducibility of FAIR data from 10 volunteers was assessed by the reposition SBM FAIR experiments. Finally, FAIR and DCE-MRI were performed on 27 subjects. The correlation between the blood flow on FAIR (BFASL ) and perfusion-related parameters on DCE-MRI was evaluated.\nThe maximum value of \u0394M and SNR were 36.39\u2009\u00b1\u200912.53 and 2.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.97, respectively; both were obtained when TI was near 1200 msec. There were no significant difference between the two successive measurements of SBM BFASL perfusion (P\u2009=\u20090.879), and the within-subject coefficients of variation (wCV) of the measurements was 3.28%. The BFASL showed a close correlation with K(trans) (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and Kep (P\u2009=\u20090.004), and no correlation with Ve (P\u2009=\u20090.082) was found.\n1200 msec was the optimal TI for the SBM ASL perfusion image, which led to the maximum \u0394M and a good quality perfusion image. The SBM FAIR perfusion scan protocol has good reproducibility, and as blood flow measurement on FAIR is reliable and closely related with the parameters on DCE-MRI, FAIR is feasible for measuring SBM blood flow.
