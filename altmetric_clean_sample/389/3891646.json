We set out to discover novel TRPC6 inhibitors and investigate the therapeutic potential of these agents.\nA library of potential TRPC inhibitors was designed and synthesised. Activity of the compounds was assessed using intracellular Ca(2+) measurements. The lead compound SAR7334 was further characterized by whole-cell patch-clamp. The effects of SAR7334 on acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) and systemic blood pressure were investigated.\nSAR7334 inhibited TRPC6, -3 and -7-mediated Ca(2+) influx into cells with IC50 s of 9.5 nM, 282 nM, and 226\u2009nM whereas TRPC4 and -5-mediated Ca(2+) entry was not affected. Patch-clamp experiments confirmed that the compound blocked TRPC6 currents with an IC50 of 7.9\u2009nM. Furthermore, SAR7334 suppressed TRPC6-dependent acute HPV in isolated perfused mouse lungs. Pharmacokinetic studies of SAR7334 demonstrated that the compound was suitable for chronic oral administration. In a first short-term study, we found that SAR7334 did not change mean arterial pressure (MAP) in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats.\nOur results confirm the role of TRPC6 in hypoxic pulmonary vasoregulation and indicate that TRPC6 is unlikely to play a major role in blood pressure regulation in SH rats. With SAR7334 we describe a novel, highly potent and bioavailable inhibitor of TRPC6 channels that opens new opportunities for the investigation of TRPC function in vivo.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002450","authors":["Maier, T","Follmann, M","Hessler, G","Kleemann, H-W","Hachtel, S","Fuchs, B","Weissmann, N","Linz, W","Schmidt, T","L\u00f6hn, M","Schroeter, K","Wang, L","R\u00fctten, H","Str\u00fcbin, C","Kleemann, H\u2010W","Str\u00fcbing, C"],"doi":"10.1111\/bph.13151","endpage":"3660","first_seen_on":"2015-04-09T08:20:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-5381"],"issue":"14","journal":"British Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1429375452,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25847402?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bph.13151\/abstract;jsessionid=46CB18B78F875C6EA15CE7A4CAB42DDF.f02t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bph.13151\/pdf","pmid":"25847402","pubdate":"2015-04-09T22:06:22+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"3650","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Discovery and pharmacological characterization of a novel potent inhibitor of diacylglycerol\u2010sensitive TRPC channels","type":"article","volume":"172","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/discovery-pharmacological-characterization-novel-potent-inhibitor-diacylglycerolsensitive-trpc-catio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6364045,"mean":5.9833578812467,"rank":4473348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1659437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6364045,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163296,"mean":9.9720528368903,"rank":109104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":46426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163296,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2056,"mean":4.6921381995134,"rank":1466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":526,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2056,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":5.3105238095238,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PH_Papers\/status\/585843318627508224","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3891646],"posted_on":"2015-04-08T16:35:06+00:00","author":{"name":"PHpapers","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CamKieff","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/580912794058428416\/h4SJZnKv_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot posting PubMeb #pulmonaryhypertension papers https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers #PH","id_on_source":"PH_Papers","tweeter_id":"3116709759","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":449},"tweet_id":"585843318627508224"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Channelomics\/status\/589469490292903936","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3891646],"posted_on":"2015-04-18T16:44:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Channelomics","url":"http:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Channelomics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2975422988\/be865d8260f2788425f6d3d656b46adb_normal.jpeg","description":"We love ion channels...so much...we've dedicated a twitter feed 2 them.
