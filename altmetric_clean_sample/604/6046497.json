Hh proteins comprise a family of secreted, cholesterol-modified ligands, which act both as morphogens and as signaling molecules. Binding of Hh proteins to their direct receptor, the transmembrane protein Patched-1, relieves Smoothened from tonal inhibition by Patched-1 and causes the translocation of Smoothened into the cilium. Here, the Hh signaling cascade is initiated and results in transcriptional activation of Hh target genes such as gli1 or patched-1. This induces a plethora of physiological outcomes including normal embryonic development, but also cancer, which is the reason why scientists aim to develop strategies to manipulate as well as monitor Smoothened-mediated Hh signaling. The zebrafish has emerged as a valuable tool for the assessment of Smoothened-mediated Hh signaling. In this chapter we thus describe how Smoothened-mediated Hh signaling can be monitored and also quantified using zebrafish embryos.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cc9e","authors":["Tena, Teresa Casar","Philipp, Melanie"],"doi":"10.1016\/bs.mcb.2015.10.001","first_seen_on":"2016-03-03T17:01:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0091-679X","0091679X"],"journal":"Methods in cell biology","last_mentioned_on":1457030630,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26928543?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0091679X15001946"],"pmid":"26928543","pubdate":"2016-03-03T22:01:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Assessing Smoothened-mediated Hedgehog signaling in zebrafish","type":"article","volume":"132","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessing-smoothenedmediated-hedgehog-signaling-zebrafish"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7346659,"mean":6.3824921979455,"rank":5296895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1792364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7346659,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281318,"mean":10.666938883892,"rank":181619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":83816,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281318,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281,"mean":1.5342,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.6911764705882,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
