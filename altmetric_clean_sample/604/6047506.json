Studies performed in peripheral lymphocytes of those women revealed several markers of global genome instability, including an increased frequency of micronuclei, shorter telomeres and impaired global DNA methylation. Furthermore, young mothers of DS individuals (MDS) are at increased risk to develop dementia later in life, suggesting that they might be \"biologically older\" than mothers of euploid babies of similar age. Mutations in folate pathway genes, and particularly in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) one, have been often associated with maternal risk for a DS birth as well as with risk of dementia in the elderly. Recent studies pointed out that also changes in MTHFR methylation levels can contribute to human disease, but nothing is known about MTHFR methylation in MDS tissues. We investigated MTHFR promoter methylation in DNA extracted from perypheral lymphocytes of 40 MDS and 44 matched control women that coinceived their children before 35 years of age, observing a significantly increased MTHFR promoter methylation in the first group (33.3\u00b18.1% vs. 28.3\u00b15.8%; p=0.001). In addition, the frequency of micronucleated lymphocytes was available from the women included in the study, was higher in MDS than control mothers (16.1\u00b18.6\u2030 vs. 10.5\u00b14.3\u2030; p=0.0004), and correlated with MTHFR promoter methylation levels (r=0.33; p=0.006). Present data suggest that MTHFR epimutations are likely to contribute to the increased genomic instability observed in cells from MDS, and could play a role in the risk of birth of a child with DS as well as in the onset of age related diseases in those women.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000821b","authors":["Copped\u00e8, Fabio","Denaro, Maria","Tannorella, Pierpaola","Migliore, Lucia"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mrfmmm.2016.02.008","endpage":"6","first_seen_on":"2016-03-03T20:58:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-135X","00275107"],"journal":"Mutation Research\/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis","last_mentioned_on":1476523526,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26926955\/","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0027510716300173"],"pmid":"26926955","pubdate":"2016-03-03T22:01:37+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Increased MTHFR promoter methylation in mothers of Down syndrome individuals","type":"article","volume":"787","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-mthfr-promoter-methylation-mothers-down-syndrome-individuals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7546003,"mean":6.5175573163071,"rank":5446123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1834310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7546003,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282955,"mean":10.739803946931,"rank":183581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":82996,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282955,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1309,"mean":3.8715963302752,"rank":1121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1309,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.92307692307692,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
