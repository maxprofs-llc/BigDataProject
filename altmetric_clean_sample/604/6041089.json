In this study we identified long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MALAT1 can function as a ceRNA of cell division cycle 42 (cdc42) 3'UTR in inducing migration and invasion of breast cancer cells via miR-1. We found that miR-1 bound both MALAT1 and cdc42 3'UTR directly. Further study showed that MALAT1 induced migration and invasion of breast cancer cells while reduced the level of cdc42. Our results suggest that MALAT1 regulated migration and invasion of breast cancer cells via affecting cdc42 through binding miR-1 competitively.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Chou, Jinjiang","Wang, Bingyu","Zheng, Tianjing","Li, Xiaoman","Zheng, Lufeng","Hu, Jinhang","Zhang, Yan","Xing, Yingying","Xi, Tao"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2016.02.102","first_seen_on":"2016-03-02T16:29:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1090-2104"],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1456996761,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26926567?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26926567","pubdate":"2016-03-02T22:01:52+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"MALAT1 induced migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells by competitively binding miR-1 with cdc42","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/malat1-induced-migration-invasion-human-breast-cancer-cells-competitively-binding-mir1-cdc42"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7346659,"mean":6.3824921979455,"rank":3300494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4016970,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7346659,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281976,"mean":10.657746949197,"rank":125928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":154173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281976,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7991,"mean":2.7397672090113,"rank":5182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":2799,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7991,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299,"mean":1.9885637583893,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
