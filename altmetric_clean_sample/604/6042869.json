MRI in companion animals should be considered in the following circumstances: a definitive diagnosis cannot be made on radiographs; a patient is nonresponsive to medical or surgical therapy; prognostic information is desired; assessing surgical margins and traumatic and\/or infectious joint and bone disease; ruling out subtle developmental or early aggressive bone lesions. The MRI features of common disorders affecting the shoulder, elbow, stifle, carpal, and tarsal joints are included in this chapter.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c6e","authors":["Sage, Jaime E","Gavin, Patrick"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cvsm.2015.12.003","first_seen_on":"2016-03-02T23:16:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-1306","01955616"],"journal":"Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice","last_mentioned_on":1456958692,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0195561615001801"],"pmid":"26928749","pubdate":"2016-03-03T22:00:53+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Musculoskeletal MRI ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/musculoskeletal-mri-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7342039,"mean":6.3783632029643,"rank":6347665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7342039,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281940,"mean":10.656105646966,"rank":237759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281940,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":330,"mean":2.2506930091185,"rank":207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":330,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.50666666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
