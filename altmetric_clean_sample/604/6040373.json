The morphological characterizations of GFeF revealed uniform distribution of iron oxide nanoparticles between graphene nanosheets. The surface chemical characterizations confirmed that graphene oxide in the as-prepared hybrid film was effectively reduced upon annealing at 300 oC. The electrochemical performance of GFeF half-cell vs. Li\/Li+ exhibited high gravimetric capacity (855.2 mAh g-1 at 0.02 A g-1), high volumetric capacity (1949.9 mAh cm-3 at 0.02 A g-1) and superior cycling stability (93% capacitance retention after 500 cycles). Based on such bendable electrode, hybrid Li-ion supercapacitor that offer operation voltage of 3.5 V and deliver high energy density (129.6 Wh kg-1) like a Li-ion battery combined with high power density (1870 W kg-1) like a supercapacitor was fabricated. In addition to the superior energy storage capability, the as-fabricated prototype pouch-cell also exhibited excellent mecahnical flexiblity and stable electrochemical performances under dynamic bending. The viability of such energy storage device provides a possible design pathway for future wearable electronics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Li, Meng","Pan, Feng","Choo, Eugene Shi Guang","Lv, Yunbo","Chen, Yu","Xue, Jun Min"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsami.5b10853","first_seen_on":"2016-03-02T13:30:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1944-8252"],"journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1456926609,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26926985?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26926985","pubdate":"2016-03-02T22:01:43+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
