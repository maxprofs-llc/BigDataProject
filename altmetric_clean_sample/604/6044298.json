Our results show that the current labour market patterns of female immigrants to Canada do not fit this profile, as previous studies found, but rather conform to patterns recently exhibited by married native women elsewhere, with rising participation and wage progression. At best, only relatively uneducated immigrant women in unskilled occupations may fit the profile of secondary workers, with slow skill mobility and low-status job-traps. Educated immigrant women, on the other hand, experience skill assimilation over time: a reduction in physical strength and an increase in analytical skills required in their jobs relative to those of natives.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5973cf058f61000507d","authors":["Al\u00edcia Adser\u00e0","Ana Ferrer"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.labeco.2016.02.003","first_seen_on":"2016-03-03T06:38:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09275371","0927-5371"],"journal":"Labour Economics","last_mentioned_on":1456987052,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0927537116000312&_version=1&md5=7a923d6c872ace1d329e2e6f980a7fe3"],"pmcid":"PMC4874528","pmid":"27217617","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Business, Management and Accounting","Economics, Econometrics and Finance"],"title":"Occupational Skills and Labour Market Progression of Married Immigrant Women in Canada ","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/occupational-skills-labour-market-progression-married-immigrant-women-canada"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7346659,"mean":6.3824921979455,"rank":6351698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7346659,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281318,"mean":10.666943149543,"rank":237200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281318,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":460,"mean":6.1220043572985,"rank":401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":460,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.0125,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
