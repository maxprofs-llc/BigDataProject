Recent findings have led to renewed interest in this pathology. The discovery of new gene mutations in the atypical form of HUS and the experimental data suggesting the involvement of the complement pathway in the typical form, open new perspectives for treatment. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on both typical and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome pathophysiology and examines new perspectives for treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f61000329c","authors":["Picard, C","Burtey, S","Bornet, C","Curti, C","Montana, M","Vanelle, P"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.patbio.2015.03.001","first_seen_on":"2016-03-03T07:02:28+00:00","issns":["0369-8114","03698114"],"issue":"3","journal":"Pathologie Biologie","last_mentioned_on":1460103222,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25845294?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25845294","pubdate":"2015-04-03T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology","biology"],"title":"Pathophysiology and treatment of typical and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pathophysiology-treatment-typical-atypical-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7520778,"mean":6.5030037002784,"rank":5428525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1827787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7520778,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282701,"mean":10.73304379908,"rank":183420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":83009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282701,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":2.635156462585,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
