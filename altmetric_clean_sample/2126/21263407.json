Previously, we have demonstrated that Bacillus licheniformis\u00a0JS2 derived biogenic selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs)\u00a0induce non-apoptotic cell death in prostate adenocarcinoma cell line, PC-3, at a minimal concentration of 2\u00a0\u00b5g Se\/ml, without causing toxicity to the primary cells. However, the mechanism behind its anticancer activity was elusive.\nOur results have shown that these SeNPs at a concentration of 2\u00a0\u00b5g Se\/ml were able to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS)\u00a0mediated necroptosis\u00a0in PC-3 cells by gaining cellular internalization. Real-time qPCR analysis showed increased expression of necroptosis associated tumor necrotic factor (TNF) and interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). An increased expression of RIP1 protein was also observed at the translational level upon SeNP treatment. Moreover, the cell viability was significantly increased in the presence of necroptosis inhibitor, Necrostatin-1.\nData suggest that our biogenic SeNPs induce cell death in PC-3 cells by the ROS-mediated activation of necroptosis, independent to RIP3 and MLKL, regulated by a RIP1 kinase.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ce3cf058f610000631","authors":["Praveen Sonkusre","Swaranjit Singh Cameotra","Praveen Sonkusre","Swaranjit Singh Cameotra"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12951-017-0276-3","first_seen_on":"2017-06-22T11:30:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-3155"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Nanobiotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1498131030,"links":["https:\/\/jnanobiotechnology.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12951-017-0276-3"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/jnanobiotechnology.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12951-017-0276-3?site=jnanobiotechnology.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28592284","pubdate":"2017-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Molecular Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Engineering","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"43","subjects":["nanotechnology","biotechnology"],"title":"Biogenic selenium nanoparticles induce ROS-mediated necroptosis in PC-3 cancer cells through TNF activation","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biogenic-selenium-nanoparticles-induce-rosmediated-necroptosis-pc3-cancer-cells-through-tnf-activati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":7267972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236990,"mean":12.951541835275,"rank":193953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236990,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":4.5349504132231,"rank":187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":6.8,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ProstateCell\/statuses\/877851285495705600","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21263407],"posted_on":"2017-06-22T11:30:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Prostate Cell News","url":"http:\/\/www.prostatecellnews.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/748303124712955905\/NtSW3SIU_normal.jpg","description":"The online resource for the prostate cell community.
