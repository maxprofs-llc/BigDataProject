However, financial return on investment in the poor settings where these diseases are mostly prevalent is very minimal to support market-driven drug discovery and development. Moreover, the imminent loss of therapeutic lifespan of existing therapies due to evolution and spread of drug resistance further compounds the urgency to identify novel effective drugs. However, the advent of new public-private partnerships focused on tropical diseases and the recent release of large data sets by pharmaceutical companies on antimalarial and antituberculosis compounds derived from phenotypic whole cell high throughput screening have spurred renewed interest and opened new frontiers in malaria and tuberculosis drug discovery. This Account recaps the existing challenges facing antimalarial and antituberculosis drug discovery, including limitations associated with experimental animal models as well as biological complexities intrinsic to the causative pathogens. We enlist various highlights from a body of work within our research group aimed at identifying and characterizing new chemical leads, and navigating these challenges to contribute toward the global drug discovery and development pipeline in malaria and tuberculosis. We describe a catalogue of in-house efforts toward deriving safe and efficacious preclinical drug development candidates via cell-based medicinal chemistry optimization of phenotypic whole-cell medium and high throughput screening hits sourced from various small molecule chemical libraries. We also provide an appraisal of target-based screening, as invoked in our laboratory for mechanistic evaluation of the hits generated, with particular focus on the enzymes within the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic and hemoglobin degradation pathways, the latter constituting a heme detoxification process and an associated cysteine protease-mediated hydrolysis of hemoglobin. We further expound on the recombinant enzyme assays, heme fractionation experiments, and genomic and chemoproteomic methods that we employed to identify Plasmodium falciparum falcipain 2 (PfFP2), hemozoin formation, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PfPI4K) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis cytochrome bc1 complex as the targets of the antimalarial chalcones, pyrido[1,2-a]benzimidazoles, aminopyridines, and antimycobacterial pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyridine-1,3(2H)-diones, respectively. In conclusion, we argue for the expansion of chemical space through exploitation of privileged natural product scaffolds and diversity-oriented synthesis, as well as the broadening of druggable spaces by exploiting available protein crystal structures, -omics data, and bioinformatics infrastructure to explore hitherto untargeted spaces like lipid metabolism and protein kinases in P. falciparum. Finally, we audit the merits of both target-based and whole-cell phenotypic screening in steering antimalarial and antituberculosis chemical matter toward populating drug discovery pipelines with new lead molecules.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000213f","authors":["Okombo, John","Chibale, Kelly"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.accounts.6b00631","first_seen_on":"2017-06-22T10:00:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0001-4842","1520-4898"],"journal":"Accounts of Chemical Research","last_mentioned_on":1498162906,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28636311?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28636311?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28636311","pubdate":"2017-06-22T22:02:21+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society (ACS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Insights into Integrated Lead Generation and Target Identification in Malaria and Tuberculosis Drug Discovery","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/insights-integrated-lead-generation-target-identification-malaria-tuberculosis-drug-discovery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":4490851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2341044,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236990,"mean":12.951436134166,"rank":131923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":83059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236990,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1346,"mean":3.901892936803,"rank":835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1346,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":4.5078181818182,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
