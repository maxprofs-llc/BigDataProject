Quantitative video-densitometry is an effective technique however overlap of the aorta and left ventricle (LV) limits feasibility. We aimed to develop and validate a method to determine an 'Overlap Free Projection' (OFP).\n65 computed tomography scans of patients referred for transcatheter aortic valve implantation were analysed using 3D reconstruction to evaluate the OFP. We observed that the relative position of the descending aorta to the LV and aortic root determines the OFP and developed a rule based on this data. 81 fluoroscopic cases were assessed for validation. The OFP was determined in a significantly greater proportion of cases that followed the rule compared to those that did not (98% vs. 45%, p<0.001).\nThe OFP rule is a straightforward method to reliably determine a patient-specific OFP for contrast aortography.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccce","authors":["Teng Justin","Teng Justin","Nijenhuis Vincent","Nijenhuis Vincent","Swaans Martin","Swaans Martin","Yong Gerald","Yong Gerald","Schultz Carl","Schultz Carl"],"doi":"10.4244\/eij-d-17-00080","first_seen_on":"2017-06-22T09:50:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1969-6213"],"journal":"EuroIntervention","last_mentioned_on":1498346529,"links":["https:\/\/www.pcronline.com\/eurointervention\/ahead-of-print\/JAA_EIJ_EIJ-D-17-00080\/how-to-plan-an-overlap-free-projection-on-cta-or-fluoroscopy-to-facilitate-quantitative-analysis.html"],"pmid":"28606890","publisher":"Europa Digital & Publishing","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"How to plan an Overlap Free Projection on CTA or fluoroscopy to facilitate quantitative analysis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plan-overlap-free-projection-cta-fluoroscopy-facilitate-quantitative-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":3.2,"6m":3.2,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":2120403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6281118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237588,"mean":12.958908761843,"rank":77540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":159154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237588,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":833,"mean":4.4976514423077,"rank":289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":540,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":833,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":8.1742857142857,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
