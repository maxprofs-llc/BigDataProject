A multi-dimensional optimization effort enhanced potency at human M4 (hM4 IC50s<200nM), with only moderate species differences noted, and with enantioselective inhibition. Moreover, CNS penetration proved attractive for this series (rat brain:plasma Kp=2.1, Kp,uu=1.1). Despite the absence of the prototypical mAChR antagonist basic or quaternary amine moiety, this series displayed pan-muscarinic antagonist activity across M1-5 (with 9- to 16-fold functional selectivity at best). This series further expands the chemical diversity of mAChR antagonists.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f2","authors":["Aaron M. Bender","Rebecca L. Weiner","Vincent B.
