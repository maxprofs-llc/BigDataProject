The traditional transformation processes negatively influenced TAC and PA content (40% and 89% decrease from seed to cooked pasta, respectively), mainly during the milling process (25% and 84% decrease of TAC and PA, respectively), which has been related to the removal of external layers of kernels. Conversely, the micronisation applied on durum wheat kernels allowed to obtain whole-wheat pasta that preserved the seed endowment of antioxidant compounds even in cooked pasta. These results indicate the micronisation as a valuable approach to produce pasta with improved nutritional value and potential health-promoting effects compared to the traditional pasta.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e3f","authors":["Martini, Daniela","Ciccoritti, Roberto","Nicoletti, Isabella","Nocente, Francesca","Corradini, Danilo","D\u2019Egidio, Maria Grazia","Taddei, Federica"],"doi":"10.1080\/09637486.2017.1336751","first_seen_on":"2017-06-22T12:00:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0963-7486","1465-3478"],"journal":"International Journal of Food Sciences & Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1498132027,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28635340?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28635340","pubdate":"2017-06-22T22:04:12+00:00","publisher":"Informa UK Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"From seed to cooked pasta: influence of traditional and non-conventional transformation processes on total antioxidant capacity and phenolic acid content","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":7267972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236990,"mean":12.951538670571,"rank":193953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236990,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":677,"mean":9.0606065088757,"rank":574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":677,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":10.348333333333,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/wheat_papers\/statuses\/877855466780360705","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21263725],"posted_on":"2017-06-22T11:47:07+00:00","author":{"name":"wheatpapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/570928252454055936\/nyIDp8RF_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"wheat_papers","tweeter_id":"3062846807","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":247},"tweet_id":"877855466780360705"}]}}
