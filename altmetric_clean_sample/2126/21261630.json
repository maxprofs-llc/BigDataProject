Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with food insecurity.\nOf 538 women, 60 (11%) had household food insecurity, 47 (78%) of which were moderate or severe food insecure. After mitogen stimulation, moderate or severe food insecure women had a median IFN-\u03b3 concentration of 4.2 IU\/ml (IQR 2.2-9.8) vs. 8.4 IU\/ml (IQR 3.0-10) in women with no or mild food insecurity (P = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, higher IFN-\u03b3 concentrations were associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection (OR 1.3, 95%CI 0.51-2.1, P = 0.001), and inversely associated with moderate or severe food insecurity (OR -1.6, 95%CI -2.9 to -0.27, P = 0.02) and the number of adults in the household (OR -0.08, 95%CI -0.16 to -0.01, P = 0.03). There was no association between food insecurity and IFN-\u03b3 response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen.\nFood insecurity in pregnancy is associated with low IFN-\u03b3 levels. There was no association between food insecurity and IFN-\u03b3 response to M. tuberculosis antigen, but our study was underpowered to detect this outcome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007a18","authors":["Vaidya, A.","Bhosale, R.","Sambarey, P.","Suryavanshi, N.","Young, S.","Mave, V.","Kanade, S.","Kulkarni, V.","Deshpande, P.","Balasubramanian, U.","Elf, J.","Gupte, N.","Gupta, A.","Mathad, J.
