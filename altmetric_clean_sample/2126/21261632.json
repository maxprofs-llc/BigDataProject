Transient nephrotoxicity developed in 6.3% (3\/48) of patients and ototoxicity in 25.0% (6\/24), which was determined by audiogram as hearing loss, asymptomatic in five patients and tinnitus in one. Multivariate analysis revealed that the highest drug concentration 12 h after administration was significantly associated with the development of toxicities (adjusted odds ratio 1.862, P = 0.047).\nOur results suggest that once-daily AMK for 4 weeks with a target Cmax of 55-65 \u03bcg\/ml can be used in patients with M. abscessus lung disease, with careful monitoring of toxicity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007a18","authors":["Lee, H.","Sohn, Y.
