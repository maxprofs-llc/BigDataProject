However, over the last two decades it became clear that the nucleolus is involved in numerous other functions besides ribosome biogenesis. Our experiments indicate that the activity of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription monitors the integrity of the DNA and influences the response to nucleolar stress as well as the rate of survival. Cells with a repressed ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription activity showed an increased and prolonged p53 stabilisation after UVC-irradiation. Furthermore, p53 stabilisation after inhibition and especially after UVC-irradiation might be due to abrogation of the HDM2-p53 degradation pathway by ribosomal proteins (RPs). Apoptosis mediated by highly activated p53 is a typical hallmark of Cockayne syndrome cells and transcriptional abnormalities and the following activation of the RP-HDM2-p53 pathway would be a possible explanation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Assfalg, Robin","Alupei, Marius Costel","Wagner, Maximilian","Koch, Sylvia","Gonzalez, Omar Garcia","Schelling, Adrian","Scharffetter-Kochanek, Karin","Iben, Sebastian","Robin Assfalg","Marius Costel Alupei","Maximilian Wagner","Sylvia Koch","Omar Garcia Gonzalez","Adrian Schelling","Karin Scharffetter-Kochanek","Sebastian Iben"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0179843","first_seen_on":"2017-06-22T10:17:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1498126627,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28636660?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0179843"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0179843&type=printable","pmid":"28636660","pubdate":"2017-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science (PLoS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Cellular sensitivity to UV-irradiation is mediated by RNA polymerase I transcription","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cellular-sensitivity-uvirradiation-mediated-rna-polymerase-i-transcription"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":4245174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3947363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236990,"mean":12.951543101156,"rank":120438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":106588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236990,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115962,"mean":10.647721992739,"rank":61422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":48952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115962,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3656,"mean":10.816093570451,"rank":1826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3656,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/genomeguardian\/statuses\/877832815898841089","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21262105],"posted_on":"2017-06-22T10:17:07+00:00","author":{"name":"TP53","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516935062370000897\/PnU7aavz_normal.jpeg","description":"A twitterbot dedicated to supplying the most recent papers about p53, the Guardian of the Genome.","id_on_source":"genomeguardian","tweeter_id":"2794540623","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":175},"tweet_id":"877832815898841089"}],"reddit":[{"title":"Cellular sensitivity to UV-irradiation is mediated by RNA polymerase I transcription","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/citral\/comments\/6inf77\/cellular_sensitivity_to_uvirradiation_is_mediated\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[21262105],"posted_on":"2017-06-21T17:40:15+00:00","author":{"name":"officialcitral","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/citral","image":"http:\/\/a.thumbs.redditmedia.com\/gq9561mrzeY9TrVx.png","id_on_source":"citral","followers":21,"subreddit":"Centre for Investigative Research and Learning"}}]}}
