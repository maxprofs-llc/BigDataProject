However, there is still optimism about the role of RDN in the treatment of resistant hypertension, because identification of patients with increased sympathetic activity thus being good RDN responders, improvements in the RDN procedure and new technology RDN catheters are all expected to lead to better RDN results. We present our initial experience with RDN for the treatment of resistant hypertension, and the utility of novel anesthetics and cardiac (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy ((123)I-MIBG).\nSeven patients with resistant hypertension underwent RDN and were followed up for 6 months. MIBG was performed before RDN, in order to estimate sympathetic activity and predict the response to RDN. All patients were sedated with dexmedetomidine and remifentanil during RDN. All patients tolerated the procedure well, were hemodynamically stable and their peri-procedural pain was effectively controlled. A median of 7.6 \u00b1 2.1 and 6 \u00b1 1.4 ablations were delivered in the right and left renal artery respectively, making an average of 6.8 burns per artery. No peri-procedural or late complications - adverse events (local or systematic) occurred. At 6 months, mean reduction in office BP was -26.0\/-16.3 mmHg (p=0.004\/p=0.02), while mean reduction in ambulatory BP was -12.3\/-9.2 mmHg (p=0.118\/p=0.045). One patient (14.3%) was a non-responder. None of the cardiac (123)I-MIBG imaging indexes(early and late heart-to-mediastinum (H\/M) count density ratio, washout rate (WR) of the tracer from the myocardium) were different between responders and non-responders.\nPatients with resistant hypertension who underwent RDN in our department had a significant reduction in BP 6 months after the intervention. (123)I-MIBG was not useful in predicting RDN response. Dexmedetomidine and remifentanil provided sufficient patient comfort during the procedure, allowing an adequate number of ablations per renal artery to be performed, and this could probably lead to improved RDN results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5303cf058f6100042f6","authors":["Ziakas, Antonios","Petroglou, Dimitrios","Moralidis, Efstratios","Tsioufis, Konstantinos","Doumas, Mihalis","Argiriadou, Elena","Savopoulos, Christos","Hadjimiltiades, Stavros","Stiliadis, Ioannis","Kouparanis, Antonios","Katranas, Sotirios","Lillis, Leonidas","Koutsakis, Athanasios","Karvounis, Haralambos"],"doi":"10.2174\/1874192401610010163","endpage":"170","first_seen_on":"2016-09-02T10:07:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1874-1924"],"issue":"1","journal":"Open Cardiovascular Medicine Journal","last_mentioned_on":1472810860,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27583041?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27583041","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"163","title":"Initial Experience with Renal Denervation for the Treatment of Resistant Hypertension - The Utility of Novel Anesthetics and Metaiodobenzylguanidine Scintigraphy (MIBG)","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/initial-experience-renal-denervation-treatment-resistant-hypertension-utility-novel-anesthetics-meta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":7191590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251838,"mean":12.500550252742,"rank":211163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251838,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":4.2357435897436,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
