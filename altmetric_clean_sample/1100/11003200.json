To explore patients' experiences surrounding SUDEP disclosure and opinions on how information should be delivered.\nA cross-sectional questionnaire.\nRoyal Free Hospital, London outpatient epilepsy clinics.\nNew and follow-up patients attending epilepsy clinics at a London teaching hospital over six months. Patients identified as being at risk of suffering negative emotional or psychological consequences of SUDEP discussions were excluded.\nPatient knowledge about epilepsy risks; patient opinion regarding source, timing and delivery of SUDEP information; impact on health seeking behaviour.\nNinety-eight per cent of patients were aware of medication adherence, 84% of factors influencing seizure frequency, 78% of driving regulations, 50% of SUDEP and 38% of status epilepticus; 72% of patients felt that SUDEP information should be given to all patients. Preferences for timing of SUDEP discussions varied between those wanting information at diagnosis (40%) and those preferring to receive it after three clinic appointments (18%) to avoid information overload at the first consultation. Emotional responses (48% positive, 38% negative) predominated over measurable behavioural change following SUDEP discussions.\nLess than half the patients knew about SUDEP and status epilepticus. Although the majority of patients with epilepsy wish to be informed about SUDEP early on in their diagnosis, information must be delivered in a way that promotes patient knowledge and empowerment.","altmetric_jid":"56b367fb2a83eea9718b4986","authors":["S Keddie","H Angus-Leppan","T Parker","S Toescu","A Nash","O Adewunmi","RSN Liu"],"doi":"10.1177\/2054270416654358","first_seen_on":"2016-09-02T11:15:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2054-2704"],"issue":"9","journal":"JRSM Open","last_mentioned_on":1472814912,"links":["http:\/\/shr.sagepub.com\/content\/7\/9\/2054270416654358?etoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/shr.sagepub.com\/content\/7\/9\/2054270416654358.full.pdf","pmid":"27688898","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Discussing sudden unexpected death in epilepsy: Are we empowering our patients?
