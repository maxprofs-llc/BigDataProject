It remains unknown whether older patients experience the survival benefit from the M1a subtype given a higher overall mortality risk. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result data were retrieved from 1878 metastatic melanoma patients, from 2005 to 2009, with follow-up through 2011. Hazard ratios (HRs) for 2-year overall survival were estimated for M1 subtypes among older (\u226565) and younger (<65) patients. Proportional subdistribution hazard ratios (SHRs) were calculated for melanoma-specific and competing risk mortality. For both older and younger patients, worse overall survival was observed for the M1c compared to the M1a subtype [HR: 2.65, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.02-3.49; and, SHR: 3.36, 95% CI: 2.56-4.41; respectively]. For competing mortality, older compared to younger patients had increased risk in the M1a and M1b subtypes (SHR: 6.07, 95% CI: 1.94-19.0, and SHR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.08-5.05, respectively). Conversely, when examining melanoma-specific mortality, older patients had decreased risk in M1a and M1b subtypes (SHR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.14-0.53, and SHR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.38-0.94, respectively) compared to those under 65 years. The persistent prognostic advantage of M1a among older patients should be considered when calculating the risk-benefit ratio for treatment. Prior reports of a protective effect of older age on melanoma-specific mortality, when based on traditional competing risks analyses, might be explained as an artifact of increased competing mortality risk.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f61000815e","authors":["Hoag, Jessica R","Hegde, Upendra","Zweifler, Rebecca","Berwick, Marianne","Swede, Helen"],"doi":"10.1097\/cmr.0000000000000276","endpage":"512","first_seen_on":"2016-09-02T10:09:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-5636","0960-8931"],"issue":"5","journal":"Melanoma Research","last_mentioned_on":1472811545,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27584045?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27584045","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"505","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Competing risks survival of older patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/competing-risks-survival-older-patients-metastatic-cutaneous-melanoma-seer-populationbased-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":4429648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2315121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251837,"mean":12.500575072666,"rank":138829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":88038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251837,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":344,"mean":3.1610029154519,"rank":142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":344,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.83571428571429,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
