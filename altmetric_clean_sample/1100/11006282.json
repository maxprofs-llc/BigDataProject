CSF biomarker analyses were performed using single-analyte ELISA kits. In-house validated cutoff values were applied: A\u03b21-42 <638.5 pg\/mL, T-tau >296.5 pg\/mL, P-tau181P >56.5 pg\/mL. A CSF biomarker profile was considered to be suggestive for AD if the CSF A\u03b21-42 concentration was below the cutoff, in combination with T-tau and\/or P-tau181P values above the cutoff (IWG2 criteria for AD). Biomarker analyses were requested for following clinical indications: 1) neurochemical confirmation of AD in case of clinical AD, 2) neurochemical confirmation of AD in case of doubt between AD and a non-AD dementia, 3) neurochemical diagnosis of prodromal AD in case of mild cognitive impairment, 4) neurochemical confirmation of AD in case of psychiatric symptoms (like depression, psychosis), or 5) other clinical indications. During these ten years, the number of yearly referred samples increased by 238% and clinical indications for referral showed a shift from neurochemical confirmation of AD in case of clinical AD to differential dementia diagnosis in case of doubt between AD and a non-AD dementia. Four percent of the patients also had a postmortem neuropathological examination. Together, these biomarker data were the basis for several research papers, and significantly contributed to the validation of these biomarkers in autopsy-confirmed subjects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c7a","authors":["Somers, Charisse","Struyfs, Hanne","Goossens, Joery","Niemantsverdriet, Ellis","Luyckx, Jill","De Roeck, Naomi","De Roeck, Ellen","De Vil, Bart","Cras, Patrick","Martin, Jean-Jacques","De Deyn, Peter-Paul","Bjerke, Maria","Engelborghs, Sebastiaan"],"doi":"10.3233\/jad-151097","endpage":"395","first_seen_on":"2016-09-02T11:40:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1875-8908","13872877","18758908"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Alzheimer's Disease","last_mentioned_on":1472848815,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27567807"],"pmid":"27567807","pubdate":"2016-08-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"383","subjects":["geriatrics","neurology"],"title":"A Decade of Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease in Belgium","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/decade-cerebrospinal-fluid-biomarkers-alzheimers-disease-belgium-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":821844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7493284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251837,"mean":12.500166870503,"rank":37910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":213811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251837,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2472,"mean":15.422393363011,"rank":555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":1908,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2472,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185,"mean":16.230391304348,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ARUKOxford\/statuses\/771674040704434180","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11006282],"posted_on":"2016-09-02T11:40:02+00:00","author":{"name":"ARUK Oxford Network","url":"http:\/\/www.dpag.ox.ac.uk\/aruk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/616615606427762689\/c7XnjBFe_normal.png","description":"The Oxford ARUK Network Centre brings together researchers in and around Oxford with expertise in dementia and cognition.","id_on_source":"ARUKOxford","tweeter_id":"2848267125","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":430},"tweet_id":"771674040704434180"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/drmarkdallas\/statuses\/771809989866512384","license":"gnip","rt":["ARUKOxford"],"citation_ids":[11006282],"posted_on":"2016-09-02T20:40:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Mark Dallas","url":"http:\/\/www.reading.ac.uk\/pharmacy\/about\/staff\/m-dallas.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/556105928492064768\/j9qRZTrw_normal.jpeg","description":"Curious Neuroscientist @UniofReading","id_on_source":"drmarkdallas","tweeter_id":"2978151777","geo":{"lt":51.45625,"ln":-0.97113,"country":"GB"},"followers":134},"tweet_id":"771809989866512384"}],"news":[{"title":"A Decade of Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease in Belgium.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=27823634220&p=1pl&v=1&x=qMzdRYnWNR15yaTwrWRVIw","license":"public","citation_ids":[11006282],"posted_on":"2016-09-02T17:16:46+00:00","summary":"Somers C, Struyfs H, Goossens J, Niemantsverdriet E, Luyckx J, De Roeck N, De Roeck E, De Vil B, Cras P, Martin JJ, De Deyn PP, Bjerke M, Engelborghs S.","author":{"name":"Alzforum","url":"http:\/\/www.alzforum.org","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/355\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-04-08_at_12.16.09_1.png?1428491784"}}]}}
