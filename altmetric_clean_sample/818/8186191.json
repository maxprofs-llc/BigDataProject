Using a retrotransposition assay in cultured human cells, we demonstrate that L1-encoded proteins predominantly mobilize the RNA that encodes them. At much lower levels, L1-encoded proteins can act in trans to promote retrotransposition of mutant L1s and other cellular mRNAs, creating processed pseudogenes. Mutant L1 RNAs are mobilized at 0.2 to 0.9% of the retrotransposition frequency of wild-type L1s, whereas cellular RNAs are mobilized at much lower frequencies (ca. 0.01 to 0.05% of wild-type levels). Thus, we conclude that L1-encoded proteins demonstrate a profound cis preference for their encoding RNA. This mechanism could enable L1 to remain retrotransposition competent in the presence of the overwhelming number of nonfunctional L1s present in human DNA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310d","authors":["Wei, W","Gilbert, N","Ooi, S L","Lawler, J F","Ostertag, E M","Kazazian, H H","Boeke, J D","Moran, J V"],"doi":"10.1128\/mcb.21.4.1429-1439.2001","endpage":"1439","first_seen_on":"2016-05-24T19:22:00+00:00","issns":["0270-7306"],"issue":"4","journal":"Molecular & Cellular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1464117704,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11158327"],"pmcid":"PMC99594","pmid":"11158327","pubdate":"2001-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1429","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Human L1 Retrotransposition: cis Preference versus trans Complementation","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-l1-retrotransposition-cis-preference-versus-trans-complementation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7747098,"mean":6.6307251234818,"rank":6703230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7747098,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268948,"mean":11.438082744927,"rank":224105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268948,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3814,"mean":2.9025239968529,"rank":3565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3814,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":5.0002325581395,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":29,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
