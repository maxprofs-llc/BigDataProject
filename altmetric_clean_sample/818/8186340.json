Adjusting for clustering by facility, patients at children's hospitals had lower cognitive DFQ at admission (difference between children's hospitals and other facility types: -3.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) -7.7, -0.1), shorter lengths of stay (median 16 days versus 22 days, p<.001), and higher WeeFIM efficiency (difference 0.63 (95% CI 0.25, 1.00)) than children at other facility types. Rehabilitation in a children's hospital was independently associated with higher discharge cognitive DFQ (regression coefficient 2.3, 95% CI 0.3 to 4.2) and more efficient rehabilitation admissions (regression coefficient 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.6).\nChildren who receive inpatient rehabilitation at children's hospitals have more efficient inpatient rehabilitation admissions, a shorter median length of stay, and a small improvement in cognitive function compared to children at other types of facilities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005737","authors":["Molly M.
