For such applications, it is imperative that the enzyme remains catalytically active while the quantum dot is luminescent in the bioconjugate. A critical feature that dictates this is the quantum dot-enzyme linkage chemistry. Previously such linkages have put constraints on polypeptide chain dynamics or hindered substrate diffusion to active site, seriously undermining enzyme catalytic activity. In this work we address this issue using avidin-biotin linkage chemistry together with a flexible spacer to conjugate enzyme to quantum dot.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002391","authors":["Iyer A","Chandra A","Swaminathan R","Aditya Iyer","Anil Chandra","Rajaram Swaminathan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbagen.2014.06.003","endpage":"2943","first_seen_on":"2014-06-15T10:33:30+00:00","issns":["03044165","0006-3002"],"issue":"9","journal":"BBA - General Subjects","last_mentioned_on":1402828388,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0304416514002232"],"pmid":"24937605","pubdate":"2014-06-13T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"2935","subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Hydrolytic enzymes conjugated to quantum dots mostly retain whole catalytic activity ","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0304416514002232","volume":"1840","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hydrolytic-enzymes-conjugated-quantum-dots-mostly-retain-whole-catalytic-activity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3930509,"mean":5.0218029626345,"rank":3136342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":96538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3930509,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97775,"mean":7.5563609713188,"rank":77777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":362,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97775,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275,"mean":3.3729051094891,"rank":228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
