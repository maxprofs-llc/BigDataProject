As the properties of monolithic materials are necessary limited, one route to extending them is to create a composite by combining contrasting materials. The potential of this approach is neatly illustrated by the formation of nature materials where contrasting components are combined in sophisticated hierarchical designs. In this study, inspired by the hierarchical structure of the tendon, we fabricated a novel composite by subtly combining two contrasting components: NiTi shape-memory alloy and Ag. The composite exhibits simultaneously exceptional mechanical properties of high strength, good superelasticity and high mechanical damping, and remarkable functional properties of high electric conductivity, high visibility under fluoroscopy and excellent thermal-driven ability. All of these result from the effective-synergy between the NiTi and Ag components, and place the composite in a unique position in the properties chart of all known structural-functional materials providing new opportunities for innovative electrical, mechanical and biomedical applications. Furthermore, this work may open new avenues for designing and fabricating advanced multifunctional materials by subtly combining contrasting multi-components.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Shijie Hao","Lishan Cui","Jiang Jiang","Fangmin Guo","Xianghui Xiao","Daqiang Jiang","Cun Yu","Zonghai Chen","Hua Zhou","Yandong Wang","YuZi Liu","Dennis E.
