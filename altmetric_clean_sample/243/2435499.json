Fluoroscopic barium oesophagography revealed a posterolateral pharyngeal pouch (Zenker's diverticulum (ZD)) complicating a 'cup and spill' oesophageal deformity with a smoothly tapered segment at the gastro-oesophageal junction. CT and high-resolution manometry confirmed that the underlying abnormality was a massively dilated oesophagus with aperistalsis and pan-oesophageal pressurisation, consistent with a diagnosis of oesophageal achalasia (type II). She underwent endoscopic stapled diverticulotomy, with good symptomatic relief. We discuss the aetiology of ZD, its management and the association here with oesophageal achalasia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc98","authors":["Sayles M","Harrison L","McGlashan JA","Grant DG"],"doi":"10.1136\/bcr-2013-200702","first_seen_on":"2014-06-13T23:16:27+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"dec12_1","journal":"BMJ Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1402701101,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24334471?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24334471","pubdate":"2013-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Zenker's diverticulum complicating achalasia: a 'cup-and-spill' oesophagus.","type":"article","volume":"2013","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zenkers-diverticulum-complicating-achalasia-cupandspill-oesophagus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3896935,"mean":5.0206957016851,"rank":2184932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1004673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3896935,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97654,"mean":7.4941190205537,"rank":51385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":25694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97654,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1797,"mean":2.7658385300668,"rank":706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":682,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1797,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133,"mean":1.7589242424242,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
