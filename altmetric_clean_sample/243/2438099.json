To thwart this cellular defence, HIV encodes Vif, a small protein that mediates APOBEC degradation. Therefore, the balance between APOBECs and Vif might be a crucial determinant of the outcome of retroviral infection. Vertebrates have up to 11 different APOBEC proteins, with primates having the most. APOBEC proteins include AID, a probable DNA mutator that is responsible for immunoglobulin-gene diversification, and APOBEC1, an RNA editor with antiretroviral activities. This APOBEC abundance might help to tip the balance in favour of cellular defences.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316b","authors":["Harris RS","Liddament MT"],"doi":"10.1038\/nri1489","first_seen_on":"2014-06-15T15:38:19+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"11","journal":"Nature Reviews Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1402846660,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15516966","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nri1489"],"pmid":"15516966","pubdate":"2004-11-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Retroviral restriction by APOBEC proteins.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retroviral-restriction-apobec-proteins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4723493,"mean":5.6961611337577,"rank":1053427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3649953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4723493,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113389,"mean":8.0470655272164,"rank":28699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":84243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113389,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":975,"mean":5.5520431211499,"rank":424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":975,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":2.9194857142857,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":21,"Researcher":59,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
