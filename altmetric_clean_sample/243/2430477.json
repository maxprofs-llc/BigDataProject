Confronted with the exhaustion of fossil energy resources, fermentative succinate production from renewable biomass to replace the traditional petrochemical process is receiving an increasing amount of attention. During the past few years, the succinate-producing process using microbial fermentation has been made commercially available by the joint efforts of researchers in different fields. In this review, recent attempts and experiences devoted to reduce the production cost of biobased succinate are summarized, including strain improvement, fermentation engineering, and downstream processing. The key limitations and challenges faced in current microbial production systems are also proposed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Cao Y","Zhang R","Sun C","Cheng T","Liu Y","Xian M"],"doi":"10.1155\/2013\/723412","first_seen_on":"2014-06-12T15:28:55+00:00","issns":["2314-6133"],"issue":"","journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1402586920,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24396827?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC3874355","pmid":"24396827","pubdate":"2014-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Fermentative Succinate Production: An Emerging Technology to Replace the Traditional Petrochemical Processes.","type":"article","volume":"2013","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fermentative-succinate-production-emerging-technology-replace-traditional-petrochemical-processes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4759378,"mean":5.7095406108846,"rank":3982605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4759378,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115550,"mean":8.0030714761704,"rank":92919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115550,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":1.5621304347826,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
