Lithium ions were selectively positioned on the outer PEDOT-TB surface. The distances through which the positively charged dye and PEDOT-TB(Li(+)) interacted physically or through which the TiO2 electrode and the Li(+) centers on PEDOT-TB(Li(+)) interacted ionically were precisely tuned and optimized within ca. 1 nm by controlling the thickness of the PEDOT blocking layer (the block length). The optimized structure provided efficient charge collection in an iodine-free dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) due to negligible recombination of photoinduced electrons with cationic species and rapid charge transport, which improved the photovoltaic performance (\u03b7 = 2.1 \u2192 6.5%).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["In Young Song"],"doi":"10.1021\/nn5016083","first_seen_on":"2014-06-13T18:29:11+00:00","issns":["1936-0851"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1402668222,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/nn5016083"],"pmid":"24915280","pubdate":"2014-06-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Well-Defined All-Conducting Block Copolymer Bilayer Hybrid Nanostructure: Selective Positioning of Lithium Ions and Efficient Charge Collection","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/welldefined-allconducting-block-copolymer-bilayer-hybrid-nanostructure-selective-positioning-lithium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3073665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":951935,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107961,"mean":7.7077376620972,"rank":72731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":25086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107961,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3519,"mean":8.6596418419556,"rank":2604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3519,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213,"mean":9.210641509434,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
