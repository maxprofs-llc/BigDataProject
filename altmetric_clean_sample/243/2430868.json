By simple injection of their THF solutions into water or buffer, all of the Janus compounds self-assembled into uniform, stable, and soft unilamellar vesicles, denoted glycodendrimersomes. The mixed constellation topology glycodendrimersomes were demonstrated to be most efficient in binding plant, bacterial, and human lectins. This evidence with biomedically relevant receptors offers a promising perspective for the application of such glycodendrimersomes in targeted drug delivery, vaccines, and other areas of nanomedicine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Zhang, Shaodong","Moussodia, Ralph\u2010Olivier","Sun, Hao\u2010Jan","Leowanawat, Pawaret","Muncan, Adam","Nusbaum, Christopher D.","Chelling, Kathleen M.","Heiney, Paul A.","Klein, Michael L.","Andr\u00e9, Sabine","Roy, Ren\u00e9","Gabius, Hans\u2010J.","Percec, Virgil"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201403186","endpage":"10903","first_seen_on":"2014-06-12T17:50:51+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"41","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
