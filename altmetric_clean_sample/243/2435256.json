We present a spatial elastic net approach that allows to estimate the number of compartments for each voxel such that the model complexity is not fixed a\u2009priori. A multi-compartment approach is considered, which is translated into a restricted least square model selection problem. This is done by using a set of basis functions for a given set of candidate rate constants. The form of the basis functions is derived from a kinetic model and thus describes the contribution of a specific compartment. Using a spatial elastic net estimator, we chose a sparse set of basis functions per voxel, and hence, rate constants of compartments. The spatial penalty takes into account the voxel structure of an image and performs better than a penalty treating voxels independently. The proposed estimation method is evaluated for simulated images and applied to an in vivo dataset.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f610008a29","authors":["Sommer, Julia C.","Gertheiss, Jan","Schmid, Volker J."],"doi":"10.1002\/sim.5997","endpage":"1041","first_seen_on":"2014-06-13T20:27:49+00:00","issns":["1097-0258","0277-6715"],"issue":"6","journal":"Statistics in Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1402691224,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/sim.5997\/abstract;jsessionid=D5B93391B33477D0463C22CB13D1A047.f04t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/sim.5997\/pdf","pmid":"24123120","pubdate":"2013-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Statistics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Physical Sciences","Mathematics"],"startpage":"1029","subjects":["statisticsastopic"],"title":"Spatially regularized estimation for the analysis of dynamic contrast\u2010enhanced magnetic resonance imaging data","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spatially-regularized-estimation-analysis-dynamic-contrastenhanced-magnetic-resonance-imaging-data"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6396843,"mean":5.9825057486175,"rank":3014405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1914726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6396843,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148665,"mean":7.6344381692947,"rank":73012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":57133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148665,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1139,"mean":2.0261124780316,"rank":538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":448,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1139,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":1.0546875,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
