While this method is effective and appears to recover a greater fraction of endogenous ancient material, there has been no direct comparison of results from different library construction methods on a diversity of ancient DNA samples. In addition, the single-stranded method is limited by high cost and lengthy preparation time and is restricted to the Illumina sequencing platform. Here we present in-depth comparisons of the different available library construction methods for DNA purified from 16 ancient and modern faunal and human remains, covering a range of different taphonomic and climatic conditions. We further present a DNA purification method for ancient samples that permits the concentration of a large volume of dissolved extract with minimal manipulation and methodological improvements to the single-stranded method to render it more economical and versatile, in particular to expand its use to both the Illumina and the Ion Torrent sequencing platforms. We show that the single-stranded library construction method improves the relative recovery of endogenous to exogenous DNA for most, but not all, of our ancient extracts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006ca0","authors":["E Andrew Bennett","Diyendo Massilani","Giulia Lizzo","Julien Daligault","Eva-Maria Geigl","Thierry Grange"],"doi":"10.2144\/000114176","first_seen_on":"2014-06-14T10:25:35+00:00","issns":["1940-9818"],"issue":"6","journal":"Biotechniques","last_mentioned_on":1403369458,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24924389?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24924389"],"pmid":"24924389","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Eaton Publishing Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Library construction for ancient genomics: Single strand or double strand?","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/library-construction-ancient-genomics-single-strand-double-strand"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505402,"mean":5.1012628106873,"rank":904245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3594145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505402,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107747,"mean":7.6945285950291,"rank":25318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":82174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107747,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227,"mean":2.3046814159292,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.0833333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":5,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":26,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
