As in all other areas of scientific inquiry, knowledge and understanding grow by layering new discoveries upon earlier ones. The process self-corrects and distills knowledge by discarding false ideas and unsubstantiated claims. Although self-correction is inexorable in the long-term, in recent years biomedical scientists and the public alike have become alarmed and deeply troubled by the fact that many published results cannot be reproduced. The chorus of concern reached a high pitch with a recent commentary from the NIH Director, Francis S. Collins, and Principal Deputy Director, Lawrence A. Tabak, and their announcement of specific plans to enhance reproducibility of preclinical research that relies on animal models. In this invited perspective, we highlight the magnitude of the problem across biomedical fields and address the relevance of these concerns to the field of bone and mineral metabolism. We also suggest how our specialty journals, our scientific organizations, and our community of bone and mineral researchers can help to overcome this troubling trend.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007ba6","authors":["Manolagas SC","Kronenberg HM","Manolagas, Stavros C","Kronenberg, Henry M"],"doi":"10.1002\/jbmr.2293","endpage":"2140","first_seen_on":"2014-06-13T17:58:24+00:00","funders":["niams"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1523-4681","0884-0431"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Bone & Mineral Research","last_mentioned_on":1443879750,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jbmr.2293\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jbmr.2293\/abstract?campaign=woletoc&dmmsmid=88232&dmmspid=3099945&dmmsuid=2323626#.VDP4J4-aHLE.twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24916175","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1002\/jbmr.2293;jsessionid=8C309F48A34442269214C7B76107F342.f01t03?identityKey=f06da4ba-104b-422c-a36f-aa9c89b746a4%C2%AEionCode%3DGB-EN%C2%AEionCode%3DGB-EN&identityKey=b32a1a0b-a905-4d9a-ac99-c22588f2adec&isReportingDone=true"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jbmr.2293\/pdf","pmid":"24916175","pubdate":"2014-06-09T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2131","subjects":["metabolism","orthopedics"],"title":"Reproducibility of Results in Pre-Clinical Studies: A Perspective from the Bone Field.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reproducibility-results-preclinical-studies-perspective-bone-field"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6309894,"mean":5.9755831472904,"rank":1208387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5094545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6309894,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143254,"mean":7.7371908162484,"rank":32840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":110146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143254,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1208,"mean":5.9859734879867,"rank":209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1208,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":2.1459459459459,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
