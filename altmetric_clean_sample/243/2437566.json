Microtubules inherently undergo dynamic instability, stochastically switching between phases of growth and shrinkage. In cells, some microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and molecular motors can further modulate microtubule dynamics. We present here the fission yeast mtr1(+), a new regulator of microtubule dynamics that appears to be not a MAP or a motor. mtr1-deletion (mtr1\u0394) primarily results in longer microtubule dwell-time at the cell tip cortex, suggesting that mtr1p acts directly or indirectly as a destabilizer of microtubules. mtr1p is antagonistic to mal3p, the ortholog of mammalian EB1, which stabilizes microtubules. mal3\u0394 results in short microtubules, but can be partially rescued by mtr1\u0394, as the double mutant mal3\u0394 mtr1\u0394 exhibits longer microtubules than mal3\u0394 single mutant. By sequence homology, mtr1p is predicted to be a component of the ribosomal quality control complex. Intriguingly, deletion of a predicted ribosomal gene, rps1801, also resulted in longer microtubule dwell-time similar to mtr1\u0394. The double-mutant mal3\u0394 rps1801\u0394 also exhibits longer microtubules than mal3\u0394 single mutant alone. Our study suggests a possible involvement of mtr1p and the ribosome complex in modulating microtubule dynamics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c70","authors":["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Carlier-Grynkorn","Liang Ji","Vincent Fraisier","Berang\u00e8re Lombard","Florent Dingli","Damarys Loew","Anne Paoletti","Xavier Ronot","Phong T Tran"],"doi":"10.1242\/bio.20148607","first_seen_on":"2014-06-15T10:26:13+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["2046-6390"],"journal":"Biology Open","last_mentioned_on":1405413420,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24928430?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/bio.biologists.org\/content\/3\/7\/591.short?rss=1"],"pmid":"24928430","pubdate":"2014-06-13T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Fission yeast mtr1p regulates interphase microtubule cortical dwell-time","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fission-yeast-mtr1p-regulates-interphase-microtubule-cortical-dwelltime"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505617,"mean":5.1020565259269,"rank":2346397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1494463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505617,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107476,"mean":7.7217160269831,"rank":53413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":36124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107476,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":344,"mean":2.9351370262391,"rank":168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":344,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":4.8148,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
