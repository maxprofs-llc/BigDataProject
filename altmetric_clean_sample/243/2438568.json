Inhibitors of gastric acid secretion can substantially reduce the damaging effects of NSAIDs in the stomach and duodenum. However, there are no proven effective preventative or curative treatments for NSAID-induced enteropathy. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in better understanding the pathogenesis of NSAID-enteropathy, and in particular the interplay of enteric bacteria, bile and the enterohepatic recirculation of the NSAIDs. Moreover, it is becoming clear that suppression of gastric acid secretion significantly worsens NSAID-enteropathy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a7","doi":"10.1016\/j.coph.2014.05.008","first_seen_on":"2014-06-16T00:20:58+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["14714892"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1403225220,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1471489214000496","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24929967"],"pmid":"24929967","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"NSAID-gastroenteropathy: new aspects of pathogenesis and prevention.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nsaidgastroenteropathy-new-aspects-pathogenesis-prevention"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":1650141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2825102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103470,"mean":7.9129617759911,"rank":31473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":71202,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103470,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":355,"mean":2.4392994350282,"rank":117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":355,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.6363636363636,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
