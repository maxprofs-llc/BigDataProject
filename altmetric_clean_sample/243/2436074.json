The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between plasma orexin-A and ghrelin levels with food consumption and body composition in patients with stable phase COPD. In total, 40 patients (age, 44-80 years; male, 31; female 9) who were in the stable phase of COPD were included in the study. Blood samples for plasma orexin-A and ghrelin analysis were collected after 8-12 h of fasting; certain anthropometric measurements were obtained and a 24-h dietary recall was recorded. The mean plasma orexin-A levels in the male and female patients were 1.3\u00b10.37 and 1.4\u00b10.13 ng\/ml, respectively, while the mean plasma ghrelin levels were 25.9\u00b17.31 and 27.3\u00b18.54 ng\/ml, respectively. No significant correlation was observed between the body mass index and plasma orexin-A and ghrelin levels or between the plasma ghrelin levels and dietary nutrient intake (P>0.05). The plasma orexin-A levels were demonstrated to be higher in patients with a higher dietary total fibre intake (r=0.303, P=0.022). A similar correlation was observed between plasma orexin-A levels and dietary intake of soluble (r=0.033, P=0.029) and insoluble (r=0.335, P=0.024) fibre, as well as between the daily consumption of calcium and the levels of plasma orexin-A (r=0.065, P=0.046). Therefore, the results of the present study indicated that a positive correlation existed between dietary nutrient intake and plasma orexin-A levels in patients with COPD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073b6","authors":["Gamze Akbulut","Makbule Gezmen-Karada\u011f","Yasem\u0131n Erta\u015f","Banug\u00fcl Barut Uyar","Em\u0131ne Yassiba\u015f","Duygu T\u00fcrk\u00f6z\u00fc","Fer\u0131de Celeb\u0131","Ozge Tu\u011f\u00e7e Pa\u015fao\u011flu","Onur Toka","H\u0131lal Yildiran","Nev\u0131n Sanlier","Nurdan K\u00f6kt\u00fcrk"],"doi":"10.3892\/etm.2014.1611","first_seen_on":"2014-06-14T10:01:37+00:00","issns":["1792-0981"],"issue":"6","journal":"Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1414382266,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24926354?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4043582\/"],"pmid":"24926354","pubdate":"2014-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Plasma orexin-A and ghrelin levels in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Interaction with nutritional status and body composition","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plasma-orexina-ghrelin-levels-patients-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-interaction-nutritional-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4423047,"mean":4.8154962455757,"rank":3172786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":995378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4423047,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105978,"mean":7.2102137067477,"rank":75156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":24727,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105978,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":331,"mean":1.0207575757576,"rank":127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":331,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.1589285714286,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
