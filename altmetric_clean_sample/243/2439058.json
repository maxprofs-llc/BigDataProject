A common strategy to distinguish functional aberrations from passengers is to identify those aberrations that are recurrent across multiple samples. However, the extensive variability in the length and position of SCNA: s makes the problem of identifying recurrent aberrations notoriously difficult.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d2","authors":["Hsin-Ta Wu","Iman Hajirasouliha","Benjamin J.
