Here we describe the noninvasive isolation, culture, and basic characterization of human umbilical cord stroma-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCS-MSCs). Although some technical and observational variations exist between laboratories, there has been a relatively common consensus regarding the immunological and functional characteristics of hUCS-MSCs. Successful in vitro and in vivo differentiation to several lineages makes these cells an invaluable stem cell source, deserving further testing as a cellular therapy or other applications in regenerative medicine. Therefore, the isolation and culture of hUCS-MSCs still need better clarification to ultimately build an optimal standard procedure among laboratories, tissue banks, and clinics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Alp Can","Deniz Balci"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-60761-999-4_5","first_seen_on":"2014-06-14T09:52:57+00:00","issns":["1064-3745"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1402739548,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/protocol\/10.1007\/978-1-60761-999-4_5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2F978-1-60761-999-4_5.pdf","pmid":"21431510","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Humana Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Stem Cells","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Isolation, Culture, and Characterization of Human Umbilical Cord Stroma-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/protocol\/10.1007%2F978-1-60761-999-4_5","volume":"698","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isolation-culture-characterization-human-umbilical-cord-stromaderived-mesenchymal-stem-cells-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3908982,"mean":5.0142013956037,"rank":3117060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":88888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3908982,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97424,"mean":7.5109127565005,"rank":77477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97424,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2655,"mean":1.4663574660633,"rank":1641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2655,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":1.1654054054054,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
