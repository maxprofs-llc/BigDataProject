However, 'vaccine escape' PMEN14 isolates with a 19A serotype became an increasingly important cause of disease post-PCV7. Whole genome sequencing was used to characterise the recent evolution 173 pneumococci of, or related to, PMEN14. This suggested PMEN14 is a single lineage that originated in the late 1980s in parallel with the acquisition of multiple resistances by close relatives. One of the four detected serotype switches to 19A generated representatives of the sequence type (ST) 320 isolates that have been highly successful post-PCV7. A second produced an ST236 19A genotype with reduced resistance to \u03b2-lactams owing to alteration of pbp1a and pbp2x sequences through the same recombination that caused the change in serotype. A third, which generated a mosaic capsule biosynthesis locus, resulted in serotype 19A ST271 isolates. The rapid diversification through homologous recombination seen in the global collection was similarly observed in the absence of vaccination in isolates from the Maela refugee camp in Thailand. This sample also allowed variation to be observed within carriage through longitudinal sampling. This suggests some pneumococcal genotypes generate a pool of standing variation that is sufficiently extensive to result in 'soft' selective sweeps: the emergence of multiple related mutants in parallel upon a change in selection pressure, such as vaccine introduction. The subsequent competition between these mutants makes this phenomenon difficult to detect without deep sampling of individual lineages.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ce3cf058f6100005a7","authors":["Nicholas J Croucher","Claire Chewapreecha","William P Hanage","Simon R Harris","Lesley McGee","Mark van der Linden","Jae-Hoon Song","Kwan Soo Ko","Herminia de Lencastre","Claudia Turner","Fan Yang","Raquel S\u00e1-Le\u00e3o","Bernard Beall","Keith P Klugman","Julian Parkhill","Paul Turner","Stephen D Bentley","Croucher NJ","Chewapreecha C","Hanage WP","Harris SR","McGee L","van der Linden M","Song JH","Ko KS","de Lencastre H","Turner C","Yang F","S\u00e1-Le\u00e3o R","Beall B","Klugman KP","Parkhill J","Turner P","Bentley SD","N.
