The work of Riss and colleagues reported in this issue of ACS Nano demonstrates a reverse approach that enables tuning of molecular properties with graphene. When a back-gate voltage is used, the Fermi level of graphene is shifted with respect to the electronic states of the molecules. This extra electric field opens fascinating new routes toward ultimate sensitive sensors or experimental devices for studying new molecular physics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Karl-Heinz Ernst"],"doi":"10.1021\/nn5030219","first_seen_on":"2014-06-14T21:53:27+00:00","issns":["1936-0851"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1403015136,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/nn5030219?ref=tw","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/nn5030219"],"pmid":"24916331","pubdate":"2014-06-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Charged-Molecule Physics","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chargedmolecule-physics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3939329,"mean":5.0093046728455,"rank":2977647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":793085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3939329,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98075,"mean":7.5062866698617,"rank":73837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":20257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98075,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3111,"mean":8.8360424573818,"rank":2386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3111,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204,"mean":9.2818620689655,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
