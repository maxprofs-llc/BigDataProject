In women of childbearing age, this system is dominated by Lactobacillus spp. In the present work, seventeen newly isolated vaginal strains were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing and were investigated for their antimicrobial properties. Twelve of the isolated Lactobacillus strains showed activity against one or more microorganisms. Six and five of them produced substances that inhibited the growth of two different Klebsiella strains and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. Two lactobacilli strains were active against an Escherichia coli strain, one isolate was active against an Enterococus faecalis strain and another lactobacilli strain showed antimicrobial activity against a Candida parapsilosis strain. The nature of the active compounds was additionally studied, and the presence of bacteriocin-like substances was proved. The genes related to the bacteriocin production in three of the newly isolated strains were identified and sequenced. The presence of gassericin A operon in the genome of the species Lactobacillus crispatus was described for the first time. The presence of antimicrobial activity contributes to their possible use as potential probiotic strains after further research.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002309","authors":["Galina Stoyancheva","Marta Marzotto","Franco Dellaglio","Sandra Torriani"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00203-014-1003-1","first_seen_on":"2014-06-13T20:33:32+00:00","issns":["1432-072X"],"journal":"Archives of Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1402655473,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24919535?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24919535","pubdate":"2014-06-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Bacteriocin production and gene sequencing analysis from vaginal Lactobacillus strains.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bacteriocin-production-gene-sequencing-analysis-vaginal-lactobacillus-strains-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3555375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107961,"mean":7.7071541126345,"rank":82859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":844,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107961,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":469,"mean":2.6210726495726,"rank":392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":469,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.95454545454545,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
