Transplant procedures have since changed considerably and reduced conditioning (RIC) is nowadays common. We investigated VZV reactivation without routine prophylaxis in a cohort of HSCT patients, 50% of whom had received RIC. The cumulative 2-year incidence of VZV reactivation was 20.7%. Risk factors in a multivariate analysis were treatment with mesenchymal stromal cells (RH 1.65, CI 1.07-2.54, p=0.02), total body irradiation (TBI) \u22656 Gy (RH 1.55, CI 1.14-2.13 p=0.006), engraftment later than day 16 (RH 1.46, CI 1.07-2.00, p=0.02), and age 0-19 years (RH 1.68, CI 1.21-2.35, p=0.002). There was no difference in VZV reactivation between patients receiving myeoloablative condition or RIC. VZV related complications occurred in 29% of the patients with reactivation, most common were disseminated disease and postherpetic neuralgia. No single low-risk group for VZV reactivation could be identified. We conclude that VZV reactivation remains common after HSCT and carries a high complication rate, warranting prophylaxis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e3","authors":["Ola Blennow","Gustav Fjaertoft","Jacek Winiarski","Per Ljungman","Jonas Mattsson","Mats Remberger"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbmt.2014.06.002","first_seen_on":"2014-06-12T15:08:03+00:00","issns":["1523-6536"],"journal":"Biology of Blood & Marrow Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1403244899,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24914821"],"pmid":"24914821","pubdate":"2014-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Varicella zoster reactivation after allogeneic stem cell transplantation without routine prophylaxis - the incidence remains high.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/varicellazoster-reactivation-after-allogeneic-stem-cell-transplantation-without-routine-prophylaxist"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":1131382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3896597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124440,"mean":7.9785394289574,"rank":31195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":92916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124440,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":967,"mean":2.890850931677,"rank":180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":967,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":2.8083333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":3,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Transplant_Doc\/status\/477104808407478272","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2430428],"posted_on":"2014-06-12T15:07:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Muzaffar Qazilbash","url":"http:\/\/faculty.mdanderson.org\/Muzaffar_Qazilbash\/Default.asp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1805143659\/Profile_compressed_pic-_020412_normal.jpg","description":"Stem Cell Transplant physician and clinical researcher at MD Anderson Cancer Center; special interest in myeloma.
