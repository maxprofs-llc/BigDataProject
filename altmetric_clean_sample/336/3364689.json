Using proteomics, we have also subdivided the LRP receptor family into six sub-families, encompassing the twelve family members. This review includes a discussion of proteins containing a cystine-knot protein motif (i.e., Sclerostin, Dan, Sostdc1, Vwf, Norrin, Pdgf, Mucin) and discusses how this motif plays a role in mediating Wnt signaling through interactions with LRP.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f6100070f2","authors":["Rey, Jean\u2010Philippe","Ellies, Debra L."],"doi":"10.1002\/dvdy.22181","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T22:29:41+00:00","issns":["1097-0177"],"journal":"Developmental Dynamics","last_mentioned_on":1324280921,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/dvdy.22181","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20014100","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3111251"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/dvdy.22181\/pdf","pmid":"20014100","pubdate":"2009-12-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["anatomy"],"title":"Wnt Modulators in the Biotech Pipeline","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wnt-modulators-biotech-pipeline"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4617414,"mean":5.4160956271844,"rank":1073432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2973058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4617414,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154135,"mean":8.8642742289177,"rank":45051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":107129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154135,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":662,"mean":1.9449167927383,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":662,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.5584,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
