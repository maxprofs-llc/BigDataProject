The pathogenesis of this syndrome, a subset of idiopathic CD4+ T lymphocytopenia (ICL), is uncertain. We report that CD4+ T cells from seven of eight ICL patients underwent accelerated programmed cell death, a process facilitated by T cell receptor cross-linking. Apoptosis was associated with enhanced expression of Fas and Fas ligand in unstimulated cell populations, and partially inhibited by soluble anti-Fas mAb. In addition, apoptosis was suppressed by aurintricarboxylic acid, an inhibitor of calcium-dependent endonucleases and proteases, in cells from four of seven patients, The in vivo significance of these findings was supported by three factors: the absence of accelerated apoptosis in persons with stable, physiologic CD4 lymphopenia without clinical immune deficiency; detection of serum antihistone H2B autoantibodies, one consequence of DNA fragmentation, in some patients; and its selectivity, with apoptosis limited to the CD4 population in some, and occurring among CD8+ T cells predominantly in those individuals with marked depletion of both CD4+ T lymphocytes linked to clinical immune suppression have evidence for accelerated T cell apoptosis in vitro that may be pathophysiologic and amenable to therapy with apoptosis inhibitors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cff","authors":["J Laurence","D Mitra","M Steiner","D H Lynch","F P Siegal","L Staiano-Coico"],"doi":"10.1172\/jci118464","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T00:46:31+00:00","issns":["0021-9738"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Investigation","last_mentioned_on":1463489036,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1172\/JCI118464","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8609222","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC507103"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jci.org\/articles\/view\/118464\/files\/pdf","pmid":"8609222","publisher":"American Society for Clinical Investigation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Apoptotic depletion of CD4+ T cells in idiopathic CD4+ T lymphocytopenia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/apoptotic-depletion-cd4-t-cells-idiopathic-cd4-t-lymphocytopenia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7711702,"mean":6.6147835493025,"rank":1878186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4809117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7711702,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236367,"mean":8.1102793887444,"rank":66661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":164983,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236367,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6206,"mean":13.187076228848,"rank":2654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":2139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6206,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":37.07396039604,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
