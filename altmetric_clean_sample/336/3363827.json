Transplacental infection was indicated by the presence of high titers of hemagglutination inhibiting (HI) antibody for PPV in serums of 0-day-old, hysterectomy-derived, colostrum-deprived pigs of 3 of 82 litters. All letters were farm-raised dams. Moreover, cell cultures prepared from 3 of 49 lots of fetal porcine kidneys (FPK) collected from an abattoir during an interval of 14 months were found contaminated with PPV. Because each lot was usually comprised of kidneys from 2 litters, the latter finding suggests that 3 of approximately 98 litters were infected. Prior infection of FPK cell cultures with PPV resulted in only slight interference of replication of other selected viruses; i.e., porcine enterovirus (PEV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV). Moreover, PPV and HEV were propagated in the same cell cultures during 5 serial passages of the viruses. In contrast, when copropagation of PPV and VSV was attempted, PPV was not detected after the 2nd serial passage.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002221","authors":["W L Mengeling"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T22:06:16+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0002-9645"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Veterinary Research","last_mentioned_on":1329382568,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/163603"],"pmid":"163603","pubdate":"1975-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Porcine parvovirus: frequency of naturally occurring transplacental infection and viral contamination of fetal porcine kidney cell cultures.","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/porcine-parvovirus-frequency-naturally-occurring-transplacental-infection-viral-contamination-fetal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626939,"mean":4.9512885298875,"rank":817826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626939,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93403,"mean":8.0168184193058,"rank":24121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93403,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":507,"mean":1.8782608695652,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":507,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.03,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
