Introduction of virus to susceptible herds results in 100% infection rate within the following 3 months. Active immunity is associated with high persistent levels of haemagglutination-inhibitating (HI) antibody (greater than 256), piglets suckling immune sows acquiring HI titres between 10,000 and 40,000. Loss of passive immunity, measured by HI, occurs in a majority of pigs between 14 and 26 weeks of age (mean 21 weeks), whilst an average of 25% (2-47%) of pigs lose HI titres between 26 and 36 weeks of age. Susceptibility to challenge with virus does not occur until 3-5 weeks following loss of HI titres. In endemically infected herds 98-100% of adult pigs show serological evidence of active immunity. A significant proportion of gilts may not be actively immune to porcine parvovirus at the time of first service, and subsequent infection may occur while these gilts are pregnant.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006bb5","authors":["R H Johnson","C Donaldson-Wood","U Allender"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T22:06:19+00:00","issns":["0005-0423"],"issue":"2","journal":"Australian Veterinary Journal","last_mentioned_on":1329382568,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/985234"],"pmid":"985234","pubdate":"1976-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Observations on the epidemiology of porcine parvovirus.","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/observations-epidemiology-porcine-parvovirus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632901,"mean":4.9227823810231,"rank":815876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295071,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632901,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94427,"mean":8.1398405100292,"rank":24558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94427,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":341,"mean":2.5682176470588,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":341,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.79166666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"DK":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Porcine parvovirus","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=477152845#altmetric_citation_23","license":"public","citation_ids":[3363829,3363832],"posted_on":"2012-02-16T08:56:08+00:00","summary":"Porcine parvovirus (PPV) causes reproductive failure of swine characterized by embryonic and fetal infection and death, usually in the absence of outward maternal clinical signs.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=4741170","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Citation bot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Citation bot"}}]}}
