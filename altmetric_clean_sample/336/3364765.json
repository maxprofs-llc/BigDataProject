All amino acids were coupled to the peptide-resin in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole; tert-butyloxycarbonyl-protected amino acids with the appropriate side-chain-protecting groups that are stable to the reaction conditions used in the solid-phase methodology were used. After cleavage and deprotection, the crude apoC-II was purified by ion-exchange chromatography and then by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The purified apolipoprotein was found to elute as a single peak under various chromatographic conditions, and the overall yield of the final purified protein was 20.7%. Synthetic apoC-II was characterized by several complementary analytical techniques including amino acid composition, Edman phenylisothiocyanate degradation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and high-performance liquid chromatography. The final product was found to be homogeneous and to activate normal human post-heparin lipase to the same extent as native apoC-II. The synthetic protein is also equally immunoreactive as native apoC-II.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1987PNAS...84.4796F","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["T Fairwell","A V Hospattankar","H B Brewer","S A Khan"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.84.14.4796","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T22:33:32+00:00","issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1289766674,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.84.14.4796","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3474626","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC305192"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/84\/14\/4796.full.pdf","pmid":"3474626","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Human plasma apolipoprotein C-II: total solid-phase synthesis and chemical and biological characterization.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-plasma-apolipoprotein-cii-total-solidphase-synthesis-chemical-biological-characterization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3991275,"mean":5.0366419655303,"rank":917643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3991275,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124111,"mean":9.0127257769507,"rank":37400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":85055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124111,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35331,"mean":14.072323481117,"rank":13982,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":14595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35331,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":956,"mean":39.529979057592,"rank":597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":956,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Apolipoprotein C2","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=396768609#altmetric_citation_14","license":"public","citation_ids":[3364765],"posted_on":"2010-11-14T20:31:14+00:00","summary":"Apolipoprotein C2 or Apolipoprotein C-II is a protein that in humans is encoded by the APOC2 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=4826184","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Jimhsu77479","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Jimhsu77479"}}]}}
