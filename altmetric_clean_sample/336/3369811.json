Studies have shown that miR-93\u00bfs targetome in cancer has not been fully defined. Moreover, the role of miR-93 in epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) remains largely unknown.Methods MIR-93 mRNA expression in normal ovarian tissue, benign tumors, borderline tumors, primary ovarian carcinomas, and metastatic omentum was quantified. The ovarian carcinoma cell lines OVCAR3, SKOV3\/DDP, and HO8910-PM were transfected with miR-93-5P, after which cell phenotype and expression of relevant molecules were assayed. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and a xenograft mouse model were used to examine miR-93 and its target gene RHOC (Ras homolog gene family member C).Results MIR-93 mRNA expression was significantly lower in ovarian carcinomas and borderline tumors than in normal ovarian tissues (p\u00bf<\u00bf0.05), and was lower in metastatic omentum than in relative primary ovarian carcinomas (p\u00bf<\u00bf0.05). MIR-93 mRNA expression was also negatively associated with differentiation (well vs. poor and moderate) and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging (FIGO stage I\/II vs. stage III\/IV) in ovarian carcinoma (p\u00bf<\u00bf0.05), besides, miR-93 was higher expressed in mucinous adenocarcinoma than the other types (p\u00bf<\u00bf0.05). MiR-93-5P overexpression reduced proliferation (p\u00bf<\u00bf0.05); promoted G1 or S arrest and apoptosis (p\u00bf<\u00bf0.05); suppressed migration and invasion (p\u00bf<\u00bf0.05); and reduced RhoC, P70S6 kinase, Bcl-xL, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) mRNA or protein expression; conversely, it induced P53 and cleaved PARP expression (p\u00bf<\u00bf0.05). Dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-93 directly targeted RhoC by binding its 3\u00bf untranslated region. MiR-93-5P transfection also suppressed tumor development and RhoC expression (determined by immunohistochemistry) in vivo in the xenograft mouse model (p\u00bf<\u00bf0.05).ConclusionsThis is the first demonstration that miR-93-5P may inhibit EOC tumorigenesis and progression by targeting RhoC. These findings indicate that miR-93-5P is a potential suppressor of ovarian cellular proliferation. The involvement of miR-93-5P\u00bfmediated RhoC downregulation in inhibiting EOC aggressiveness may provide extended insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer aggressiveness.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000873","authors":["Xi Chen","Shuo Chen","Yin-Ling Xiu","Kai-Xuan Sun","Zhi-Hong Zong","Yang Zhao"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12943-015-0304-6","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T00:50:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-4598"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1423159866,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25649143?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25649143","pubdate":"2015-02-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"RhoC is a major target of microRNA-93-5P in epithelial ovarian carcinoma tumorigenesis and progression.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rhoc-major-target-microrna935p-epithelial-ovarian-carcinoma-tumorigenesis-progression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5058381,"mean":5.9847169409996,"rank":4207358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5058381,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179897,"mean":8.630517654645,"rank":143979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179897,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":607,"mean":3.054801980198,"rank":523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":607,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":4.645,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
