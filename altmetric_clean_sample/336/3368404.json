Here we show that the SCD1-\/- mice have increased insulin signaling in muscle. The basal tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 are elevated. The tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor was similar between SCD1+\/+ and SCD1-\/- mice. The association of insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 with alphap85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase as well as the phosphorylation of Akt-Ser-473 and Akt-Thr-308 are also elevated in the SCD1-\/- mice. Interestingly, the mRNA levels, protein mass, and activity of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B implicated in the attenuation of the insulin signal are reduced in the SCD1-\/- mice, whereas the levels of the leukocyte antigen-related protein phosphatase are similar between two groups of mice. The content of glucose transporter 4 in the plasma membrane and basal as well as insulin-mediated glucose uptake are increased in the SCD1-\/- mice. In addition, the muscle glycogen content and the activities of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase are increased in the SCD1-\/- mice. We hypothesize that loss of SCD1 function induces increased insulin signaling at least in part by a reduction in the expression of protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B. SCD1 could be a therapeutic target in the treatment of diabetes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2003PNAS..10011110R","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Shaikh Mizanoor Rahman","Agnieszka Dobrzyn","Pawel Dobrzyn","Seong-Ho Lee","Makoto Miyazaki","James M.
