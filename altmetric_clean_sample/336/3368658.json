This ORF is located approximately 200 bp downstream of the ptsI gene coding for enzyme I of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system. Mutant BCH150, in which the putative gapN gene had been inactivated, lacked GAPN activity that was present in the wild-type strain, thus positively identifying the ORF as the S. mutans gapN gene. Another strain of S. mutans, DC10, which contains an insertionally inactivated ptsI gene, still possessed GAPN activity, as did S. salivarius ATCC 25975, which contains an insertion element between the ptsI and gapN genes. Since the wild-type S. mutans NG5 lacks both glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and NADH:NADP oxidoreductase activities, the NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is important as a means of generating NADPH for biosynthetic reactions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cba","authors":["D A Boyd","D G Cvitkovitch","I R Hamilton"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T00:20:31+00:00","issns":["0021-9193"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Bacteriology","last_mentioned_on":1340722607,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7751269","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC176930"],"pmcid":"PMC176930","pmid":"7751269","pubdate":"1995-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["bacteriology"],"title":"Sequence, expression, and function of the gene for the nonphosphorylating, NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Streptococcus mutans.","type":"article","volume":"177","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sequence-expression-function-gene-nonphosphorylating-nadpdependent-glyceraldehyde3phosphate-dehydrog"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634361,"mean":4.9198212791297,"rank":815884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634361,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94738,"mean":8.1427648965031,"rank":24696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94738,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3030,"mean":2.7070894684714,"rank":404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3030,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.1089285714286,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
