The aim of this study was to investigate the antileukemic activity of this epigenetic agent in combination with genistein, a nontoxic isoflavone with chemopreventive activity. The combined treatment produced a synergistic loss of clonogenicity in human myeloid (HL-60) and lymphoid (MOLT-3) leukemic cell lines. Genistein alone showed a significant antileukemic activity against murine 5-AZA-CdR-resistant cells, and this effect was enhanced when used in combination with 5-AZA-CdR. The combined treatment also produced a synergistic increase in life span of mice with L1210 leukemia. These results suggest that genistein may have the potential to increase the clinical efficacy of 5-AZA-CdR for the treatment of leukemia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000837f","authors":["No\u00ebl J M Raynal","Michel Charbonneau","Louise F Momparler","Richard L Momparler"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T22:13:16+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0965-0407"],"issue":"5","journal":"Oncology Research","last_mentioned_on":1257105573,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18980019"],"pmid":"18980019","pubdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Synergistic effect of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine and genistein in combination against leukemia.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synergistic-effect-5aza2deoxycytidine-genistein-combination-against-leukemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616388,"mean":4.9295982487525,"rank":815306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2277730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616388,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91961,"mean":7.120353892997,"rank":23284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":67601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91961,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":1.1521276595745,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
