On September 6, 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Totect 500 mg (dexrazoxane hydrochloride for injection) for the treatment of extravasation resulting from i.v. anthracycline chemotherapy. In two studies, a total of 57 evaluable patients experienced extravasation from peripheral vein or central venous access sites with local swelling, pain, or redness. The presence of anthracycline in skin biopsy tissue was confirmed by tissue fluorescence, and treatment with a 3-day schedule of dexrazoxane began within 6 hours of the event. The primary endpoint was a reduction in the need for surgical intervention. Only one patient required surgical repair of the injury site, and late sequelae in the remainder were absent or mild. Also, the sponsor, TopoTarget A\/S, Copenhagen, Denmark, performed controlled nonclinical studies in support of dexrazoxane dose and timing for the reduction of tissue injury resulting from anthracycline extravasation. For this uncommon but serious complication of anthracycline therapy, the need for surgical intervention was 1.7% with this regimen.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005bda","authors":["Robert C.
