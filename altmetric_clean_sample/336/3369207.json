Previously, we reported that GATA-1 and Elf-1 recognition sites were necessary for cell type-specific activation of the alpha-chain gene promoter. More detailed analysis revealed that other transcription factors bound the regions close to the Elf-1 recognition site and there was a more complex mechanism for the regulation of the promoter activity. On the other hand, during a course of studies to find cis-elements over this gene, CAGCTG sequence in the first intron was revealed to serve as an enhancer. A complex composed of USF1 and USF2 activated the human alpha-chain gene expression via this intronic element. Furthermore, we found two novel exons at 18.4 and 12.6kb upstream from the reported first exon and discovered an additional distal promoter.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f610003116","authors":["Kyoko Takahashi","Chiharu Nishiyama","Chisei Ra"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T00:33:45+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0161-5890"],"issue":"16-18","journal":"Molecular Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1195371420,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12217383"],"pmid":"12217383","pubdate":"2002-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Transcriptional regulation of the human high affinity IgE receptor alpha-chain gene.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transcriptional-regulation-human-high-affinity-ige-receptor-alphachain-gene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3991275,"mean":5.0366419655303,"rank":917451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3991275,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124393,"mean":9.0196113643491,"rank":37582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":85163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124393,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":663,"mean":2.0293836858006,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":663,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":1.6157894736842,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"FCER1A","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=172238636#altmetric_citation_17","license":"public","citation_ids":[3466253,3369207],"posted_on":"2007-11-18T07:37:00+00:00","summary":"Fc fragment of IgE, high affinity I, receptor for; alpha polypeptide, also known as FCER1A, is a protein which in humans is encoded by the FCER1A gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14156385","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
