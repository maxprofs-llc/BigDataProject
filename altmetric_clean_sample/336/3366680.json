It was prepared in consultation with the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) and is consistent with current HICPAC guidelines for infection control in health-care personnel. These recommendations can assist hospital administrators, infection control practitioners, employee health physicians, and HCWs in optimizing infection prevention and control programs. Background information for each vaccine-preventable disease and specific recommendations for use of each vaccine are presented. The diseases are grouped into three categories: a) those for which active immunization is strongly recommended because of special risks for HCWs; b) those for which immunoprophylaxis is or may be indicated in certain circumstances; and c) those for which protection of all adults is recommended. This report reflects current ACIP recommendations at the time of publication. ACIP statements on individual vaccines and disease updates in MMWR should be consulted for more details regarding the epidemiology of the diseases, immunization schedules, vaccine doses, and the safety and efficacy of the vaccines.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5063cf058f6100030f7","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T23:28:26+00:00","issns":["1057-5987"],"issue":"RR-18","journal":"MMWR Recommendations & Reports","last_mentioned_on":1341497049,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9427216"],"pmid":"9427216","pubdate":"1997-12-26T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Immunization of health-care workers: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC).","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunization-healthcare-workers-recommendations-advisory-committee-immunization-practices-acip-hospi-23"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":816870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93816,"mean":8.0809182326922,"rank":24290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93816,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":3.1612873563218,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":5,"Student  > Master":2,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":10,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Environmental Science":1,"Philosophy":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"NmVac4-A\/C\/Y\/W-135","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=488421400#altmetric_citation_27","license":"public","citation_ids":[3366680],"posted_on":"2012-04-21T01:05:26+00:00","summary":"The methods of manufacture of the vaccine product is now patented in the United States (USPTO) and in the WIPO Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) countries.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=20547586","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"RDBrown","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:RDBrown"}},{"title":"Meningococcal disease","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=500799700#altmetric_citation_7","license":"public","citation_ids":[3366680],"posted_on":"2012-07-05T14:04:09+00:00","summary":"Meningococcal disease describes infections caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (also termed meningococcus).","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=3868809","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"RDBrown","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:RDBrown"}}]}}
