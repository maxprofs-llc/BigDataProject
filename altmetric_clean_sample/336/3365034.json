Our objective was to identify chemokines induced by PGF in vivo and to determine the effects of interleukin 8 (IL8) on specific luteal cell types in vitro. Mid-cycle cows were injected with saline or PGF, ovaries were removed after 0.5-4\u200ah, and expression of chemokine was analyzed by qPCR. In vitro expression of IL8 was analyzed after PGF administration and with cell signaling inhibitors to determine the mechanism of PGF-induced chemokine expression. Purified neutrophils were analyzed for migration and activation in response to IL8 and PGF. Purified luteal cell types (steroidogenic, endothelial, and fibroblast cells) were used to identify which cells respond to chemokines. Neutrophils and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cocultured with steroidogenic cells to determine their effect on progesterone production. IL8, CXCL2, CCL2, and CCL8 transcripts were rapidly increased following PGF treatment in vivo. The stimulatory action of PGF on IL8 mRNA expression in vitro was prevented by inhibition of p38 and JNK signaling. IL8, but not PGF, TNF, or TGFB1, stimulated neutrophil migration. IL8 had no apparent action in purified luteal steroidogenic, endothelial, or fibroblast cells, but stimulated ERK phosphorylation in neutrophils. In coculture experiments neither IL8 nor activated neutrophils altered basal or LH-stimulated luteal cell progesterone synthesis. In contrast, activated PBMCs inhibited LH-stimulated progesterone synthesis from cultured luteal cells. These data implicate a complex cascade of events during luteolysis, involving chemokine signaling, neutrophil recruitment, and immune cell action within the corpus luteum.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6363cf058f610008738","authors":["Talbott H","Delaney A","Zhang P","Yu Y","Cushman R","Cupp AS","Hou X","Davis JS"],"doi":"10.1530\/rep-13-0602","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T22:39:47+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Reproduction","last_mentioned_on":1423153955,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24686456?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24686456","pubdate":"2014-04-02T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Effects of IL8 and Immune Cells on the Regulation of Luteal Progesterone Secretion.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-il8-immune-cells-regulation-luteal-progesterone-secretion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4720494,"mean":5.6985437665106,"rank":3953485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4720494,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164608,"mean":8.775391799863,"rank":132550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164608,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":576,"mean":2.1419234782609,"rank":480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":576,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.99375,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
