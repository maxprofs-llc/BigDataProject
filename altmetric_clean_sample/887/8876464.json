Diagnostic delay was shorter in sIBM (6 vs. 15 years, P = 0.0003). Wrist flexors (P = 0.02), digit flexors (P = 0.01), digit extensors (P = 0.02), and quadriceps (P = 0.008) muscles were more frequently affected in sIBM. Fibrillation potentials were more common in sIBM patients (P = 0.03). Electrical myotonia was found in 4 hIBM patients, not significantly different from sIBM patients (P = 0.45). Creatinine kinase was higher in sIBM patients (799 vs 232, P = 0.03).\nsIBM and hIBM seem to have similar electromyographic changes. The combination of clinical, serological, and histopathological findings can guide genetic testing to the final diagnosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007beb","authors":["Kazamel, Mohamed","Sorenson, Eric J","Milone, Margherita"],"doi":"10.1097\/cnd.0000000000000113","endpage":"196","first_seen_on":"2016-06-19T04:18:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1537-1611","1522-0443"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Clinical Neuromuscular Disease","last_mentioned_on":1466084970,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/CND.0000000000000113"],"pmid":"27224433","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"190","subjects":["physiology","neurology"],"title":"Clinical and Electrophysiological Findings in Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy Compared With Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-electrophysiological-findings-hereditary-inclusion-body-myopathy-compared-sporadic-inclusio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7907411,"mean":6.6922707093667,"rank":6846691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7907411,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262424,"mean":11.509728766152,"rank":219731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262424,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":1.9632647058824,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.6785714285714,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Ph.
