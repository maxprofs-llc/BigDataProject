We also documented the origin of the cortical alveoli in time and space similar to the Balbiani body; the synthesis of three generations of cortical alveoli and an active zona pellucida prior to vitellogenesis, which is implicated in the entry of oils to the interior of the oocyte. We found that in this species, the diameter of the alveoli is greater than in the other teleost fish species reported in the literature, except for Fundulus heteroclitus, in which the diameter is similar. The thickness of the zona pellucida recorded in M. robustus is the greatest reported to date. Likewise, two periods of secondary envelope deposition were documented: filaments during pre-vitellogenesis and, subsequently, trapeze-shaped projections during the maturation of the oocytes. We report about development of structures that are considered key for the survival of embryos in annual fish during the long periods of diapause in their extreme habitats. The development of peripheral structures described here probably reflects the changes in the physiology of the oocytes in M. robustus. J.
