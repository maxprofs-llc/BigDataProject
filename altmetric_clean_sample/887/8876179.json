Having diarrhea was associated with metabolic acidosis (p<0.001) and hypocalcemia (p=0.002) on presentation, and with a fatal outcome: 20\/113 (20%) died with diarrhea vs. 3\/112 (3%) without diarrhea. Diarrhea is an important co-morbidity in Bangladeshi children with severe pneumonia requiring attention for improved case-management.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008487","authors":["Chisti, Mohammod Jobayer","Duke, Trevor","Salam, Mohammed Abdus","Shahunja, KM","Shahid, Abu SMSB","Bardhan, Pradip Kumar","Faruque, Abu SG","Ahmed, Tahmeed","Shahunja, K M","Shahid, Abu Smsb","Faruque, Abu Sg","Mohammod Jobayer Chisti","Trevor Duke","Mohammed Abdus Salam","K.
