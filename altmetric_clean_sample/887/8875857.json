In the present work, we demonstrate that purified spores can also adsorb DNA on their surface after treatment with cationic molecules. In addition, we demonstrate that DNA-coated B. subtilis spores can be used as particulate carriers and act as an alternative to gold microparticles for the biolistic (gene gun) administration of plasmid DNA in mice. Gene gun delivery of spores pre-treated with DODAB (dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide) allowed efficient plasmid DNA absorption and induced protein expression levels similar to those obtained with gold microparticles. More importantly, we demonstrated that a DNA vaccine adsorbed on spores can be loaded into biolistic cartridges and efficiently delivered into mice, which induced specific cellular and antibody responses. Altogether, these data indicate that B. subtilis spores represent a simple and low cost alternative for the in vivo delivery of DNA vaccines by the gene gun technology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd3","authors":["Aps, Luana R M M","Tavares, Milene B","Rozenfeld, Julio H K","Lamy, M Teresa","Ferreira, Lu\u00eds C S","Diniz, Mariana O"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbiotec.2016.04.027","endpage":"66","first_seen_on":"2016-06-19T02:54:26+00:00","issns":["1873-4863","01681656"],"journal":"Journal of Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1466336087,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0168165616302073?sf27245162=1"],"pmid":"27130499","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"58","subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Bacterial spores as particulate carriers for gene gun delivery of plasmid DNA","type":"article","volume":"228","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bacterial-spores-particulate-carriers-gene-gun-delivery-plasmid-dna"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7917108,"mean":6.6979661075636,"rank":3319604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4584398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7917108,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262522,"mean":11.51206277593,"rank":101663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":160289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262522,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":966,"mean":3.150874611399,"rank":260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":702,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":966,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":2.0423255813953,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
