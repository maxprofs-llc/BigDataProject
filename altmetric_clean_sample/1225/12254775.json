It affects the synthesis of rare isotopes such as ^{17}O and ^{18}F, which can provide constraints on astrophysical models. A new direct determination of the E_{R}=64.5\u2009\u2009keV resonance strength performed at the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA) accelerator has led to the most accurate value to date \u03c9\u03b3=10.0\u00b11.4_{stat}\u00b10.7_{syst}\u2009\u2009neV, thanks to a significant background reduction underground and generally improved experimental conditions. The (bare) proton partial width of the corresponding state at E_{x}=5672\u2009\u2009keV in ^{18}F is \u0393_{p}=35\u00b15_{stat}\u00b13_{syst}\u2009\u2009neV. This width is about a factor of 2 higher than previously estimated, thus leading to a factor of 2 increase in the ^{17}O(p,\u2009\u03b1)^{14}N reaction rate at astrophysical temperatures relevant to shell hydrogen burning in red giant and asymptotic giant branch stars. The new rate implies lower ^{17}O\/^{16}O ratios, with important implications on the interpretation of astrophysical observables from these stars.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","arxiv_id":"1610.00483","authors":["C.\u2009G.
