In a context of generalized HIV epidemiology, we assessed paediatric anti-HBV vaccine response according to HIV status, feeding option and age in a tropical context.\nProspective, observational and cross-sectional study conducted among 82 children (27 [IQR: 9-47] months, min-max: 6-59), after complete anti-HBV vaccination (Zilbrix Hepta: 10\u03bcg AgHBs) at the Essos Health Centre in Yaounde, Cameroon, classified as group-A: HIV unexposed (28), group-B: HIV-exposed\/uninfected (29), group-C: HIV-infected (25). Quantitative anti-HBs ELISA was interpreted as \"no\", \"low-\" or \"protective-response\" with <1, 1-10, or \u226510 IU\/L respectively; with p-value<0.05 considered significant.\nChildren were all HBV-unexposed (AcHBc-negative) and uninfected (HBsAg-negative). Response to anti-HBV vaccine was 80.49% (66\/82), with only 45.12% (37\/82) developed a protective-response (\u226510IU\/L). According to HIV status, 60.71% (17\/28) developed a protective-response in group-A, vs. 51.72% (15\/29) and 20% (5\/25) in group-B and group-C respectively, Odds Ratio (OR): 2.627 [CI95% 0.933-7.500], p = 0.041. According to feeding option during first six months of life, 47.67% (21\/45) developed a protective-response on exclusive breastfeeding vs. 43.24% (16\/37) on mixed or formula feeding, OR: 1.148 [CI95% 0.437-3.026], p = 0.757. According to age, protective-response decreased significantly as children grow older: 58.33% (28\/48) <24 months vs. 26.47% (9\/34) \u226524 months, OR: 3.889 [CI95% 1.362-11.356], p = 0.004; and specifically 67.65% (23\/34) \u22646 months vs. 0%, (0\/5) 33-41 months, p = 0.008.\nAnti-HBV vaccine provides low rate of protection (<50%) among children in general, and particularly if HIV-exposed, infected and\/or older children. Implementing policies for early vaccination, specific immunization algorithm for HIV-exposed\/infected children, and monitoring vaccine response would ensure effective protection in tropical settings, pending extensive\/confirmatory investigations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Anne Esther Njom Nlend","Philippe Salomon Nguwoh","Christian Taheu Ngounouh","Hyppolite Kuekou Tchidjou","Constant Anatole Pieme","Jean Mbede Ot\u00e9l\u00e9","V\u00e9ronique Penlap","Vittorio Colizzi","Roger Somo Moyou","Joseph Fokam"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0161714","first_seen_on":"2016-09-28T05:10:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1476723950,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0161714"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0161714.PDF","pmid":"27656883","pubdate":"2016-09-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0161714","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"HIV-Infected or -Exposed Children Exhibit Lower Immunogenicity to Hepatitis B Vaccine in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon: An Appeal for Revised Policies in Tropical Settings?","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hivinfected-exposed-children-exhibit-lower-immunogenicity-hepatitis-b-vaccine-yaound%C3%A9-cameroon-appea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":2.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7554544,"mean":6.5226894405088,"rank":3116900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4405074,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7554544,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240999,"mean":12.447454144847,"rank":97496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":141746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240999,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107723,"mean":10.20550520785,"rank":44093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":62987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107723,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4098,"mean":10.064602880156,"rank":1804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4098,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
