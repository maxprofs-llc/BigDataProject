Recently, we found that Lp(a) mediates the development of CAVS through autotaxin (ATX).\nTo determine the predictive value of circulating ATX mass and activity for CAVS.\nWe performed a case-control study in 300 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients with CAVS plus CAD (cases, n = 150) were age- and gender-matched (1 : 1) to patients with CAD without aortic valve disease (controls, n = 150). ATX mass and enzymatic activity and levels of Lp(a) and oxidized phospholipids on apolipoprotein B-100 (OxPL-apoB) were determined in fasting plasma samples.\nCompared to patients with CAD alone, ATX mass (P < 0.0001), ATX activity (P = 0.05), Lp(a) (P = 0.003) and OxPL-apoB (P < 0.0001) levels were elevated in those with CAVS. After adjustment, we found that ATX mass (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.10 per 10 ng mL(-1) , P = 0.001) and ATX activity (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.14-2.17 per 10 RFU min(-1) , P = 0.005) were independently associated with CAVS. ATX activity interacted with Lp(a) (P = 0.004) and OxPL-apoB (P = 0.001) on CAVS risk. After adjustment, compared to patients with low ATX activity (dichotomized at the median value) and low Lp(a) (<50 mg dL(-1) ) or OxPL-apoB (<2.02 nmol L(-1) , median) levels (referent), patients with both higher ATX activity (\u226584 RFU min(-1) ) and Lp(a) (\u226550 mg dL(-1) ) (OR 3.46, 95% CI 1.40-8.58, P = 0.007) or OxPL-apoB (\u22652.02 nmol L(-1) , median) (OR 5.48, 95% CI 2.45-12.27, P < 0.0001) had an elevated risk of CAVS.\nAutotaxin is a novel and independent predictor of CAVS in patients with CAD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ec3cf058f610005d5b","authors":["Nsaibia, M.
