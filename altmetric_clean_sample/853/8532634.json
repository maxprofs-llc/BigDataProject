Coprimary efficacy variables were: change from baseline to End of Maintenance in patient-rated AS and UPDRS II\u2009+\u2009III total score. Recruitment was stopped after an interim futility analysis; therefore, all p values are exploratory.\nOf 122 patients randomized, 81.1\u00a0% completed the study (placebo, n\u2009=\u200932\/40 [80.0\u00a0%]; low-dose rotigotine, n\u2009=\u200930\/41 [73.2\u00a0%]; high-dose rotigotine, n\u2009=\u200937\/41 [90.2\u00a0%]). No treatment difference was observed in the change in patient-rated AS (least squares mean [95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI)] difference: low-dose, 0.04 [-2.42, 2.50], p =0.977; high-dose, -0.22 [-2.61, 2.18], p\u2009=\u20090.859). Rotigotine improved UPDRS II\u2009+\u2009III total scores versus placebo (least squares mean [95\u00a0% CI] treatment difference: low-dose, -7.29 [-12.30, -2.28], p\u2009=\u20090.005; high-dose, -6.06 [-10.90, -1.21], p\u2009=\u20090.015), and the \"mood\/apathy\" domain of the Non-Motor Symptom Scale as rated by the investigator (secondary outcome). The most frequent adverse events in rotigotine-treated patients were application site reactions, somnolence, and nausea.\nRotigotine did not improve PD-associated apathy as rated by the patient but provided clinically relevant improvement in motor control and activities of daily living.\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01782222 .
