Apelin and APJ exist in a variety of tissues, with special status in the heart, lung and tumors. Consequently, the apelin\/APJ system exerts a broad range of activities that affect multiple organ systems. Accumulating evidence indicates that the expressions of apelin and APJ are significantly augmented by hypoxia through the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) signaling pathway. Increased apelin promotes cellular proliferation, migration and survival, therefore regulating angiogenesis. In addition, the pre-administration of exogenous apelin is involved in the occurrence and development of hypoxia-induced pathological diseases. The purpose of this article is to review the properties of the apelin\/APJ system, which is affected by hypoxic conditions, and the regulation of apelin\/APJ signaling in hypoxia-associated disorders. Thus, the apelin\/APJ system may be a potential therapeutic target in hypoxia-related diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002542","authors":["He, Lu","Xu, Jing","Chen, Linxi","Li, Lanfang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cca.2015.09.029","first_seen_on":"2015-10-06T11:36:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-3492"],"journal":"Clinica Chimica Acta","last_mentioned_on":1469775877,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26436483?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26436483","pubdate":"2015-10-06T22:00:23+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistryclinical"],"title":"Apelin\/APJ signaling in hypoxia-related diseases.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/apelinapj-signaling-hypoxiarelated-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154593,"mean":6.8923629076653,"rank":5909881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":1955714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154593,"percentile":23},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241847,"mean":9.527239896463,"rank":151409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":74693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241847,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1232,"mean":2.9362599512591,"rank":791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":403,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1232,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.3484848484848,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
