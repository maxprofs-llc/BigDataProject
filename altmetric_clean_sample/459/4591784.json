In (29) Si NMR spectrum in [D8 ]toluene, the signal due to the unsaturated silicon nuclei was observed at 128.7\u2005ppm. Reactions of the dialkylsilanone with water and mesitonitrile oxide gave a silanediol and a [2+3] cycloadduct, respectively. The silanone remains intact in [D8 ]toluene below -80\u2009\u00b0C for at least two days, while it undergoes unprecedented isomerization to give a siloxysilene by means of 1,3-silyl migration at higher temperatures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Ishida, Shintaro","Abe, Takashi","Hirakawa, Fumiya","Kosai, Tomoyuki","Sato, Katsuhiro","Kira, Mitsuo","Iwamoto, Takeaki"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201501478","endpage":"15103","first_seen_on":"2015-10-06T13:20:49+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3765"],"issue":"43","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1444138486,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/wol1\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201501478\/full","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/chem.201501478"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201501478\/pdf","pmid":"26235827","pubdate":"2015-07-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"15100","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Persistent Dialkylsilanone Generated by Dehydrobromination of Dialkylbromosilanol","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/persistent-dialkylsilanone-generated-dehydrobromination-dialkylbromosilanol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6491791,"mean":5.9714737722564,"rank":3060527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1948259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6491791,"percentile":30},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":205806,"mean":9.887891129953,"rank":109253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":75247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":205806,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3923,"mean":3.0644079551249,"rank":1576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":1860,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3923,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":365,"mean":2.0253186813187,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":365,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
