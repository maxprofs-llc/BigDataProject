Study cases were defined as subjects with TB-positive sputum cultures, whereas the controls were defined as subjects with non-TB-related pulmonary diseases. Statistical analyses included logistic regression and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models.\nA total of 245 cases with cultures positive for TB and 114 controls with non-TB-related pulmonary diseases and negative sputum cultures were recruited. Current smokers had the highest failure rate (33%) for TB treatment, and they had the most severe pulmonary lesions based on chest X-ray grading. Current smokers had a 1.36-fold (95% confidence interval 1.03-2.36, P<0.05) higher odds ratio for cultures positive for TB compared with nonsmokers. In subjects with TB-positive cultures, current smoking was associated with an increase in treatment days required for cultures to convert from positive to negative (hazard ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.39; P<0.05).\nLonger periods of treatment may be required for TB patients who are current smokers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b5e","authors":["Hsiao-Chi Chuang","Kang-Yun Lee","Chien-Ling Su","Chun-Nin Lee","Po-Hao Feng","Mauo-Ying Bien","Kai-Jen Chuang","Hui-Chiao Liu"],"doi":"10.2147\/tcrm.s87218","first_seen_on":"2015-10-07T10:25:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1176-6336"],"journal":"Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management","last_mentioned_on":1445358202,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/cigarette-smoke-is-a-risk-factor-for-severity-and-treatment-outcome-in-peer-reviewed-article-TCRM","https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=24019"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=27401","pmid":"26504395","pubdate":"2015-10-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Social Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Cigarette smoke is a risk factor for severity and treatment outcome in patients with culture-positive tuberculosis","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cigarette-smoke-risk-factor-severity-treatment-outcome-patients-culturepositive-tuberculosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6348733,"mean":5.9808086398984,"rank":2255474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4052565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6348733,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194131,"mean":10.24381188894,"rank":70242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":121741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194131,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":600,"mean":3.4390550918197,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":600,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":2.3754385964912,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1,"GB":1,"US":1},"mendeley":{"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/doctorahmad75\/statuses\/651644834923462657","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4595376],"posted_on":"2015-10-07T06:26:50+00:00","author":{"name":"Abrar Ahmad Chughtai","url":"http:\/\/unsw.edu.au","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/699171849511399424\/EG4GYCYy_normal.jpg","description":"Infectious diseases epidemiologist, Doctor, Academic, Researcher, Father, Believe in love for all hatred for none","id_on_source":"doctorahmad75","tweeter_id":"520314860","geo":{"lt":-33.86785,"ln":151.20732,"country":"AU"},"followers":311},"tweet_id":"651644834923462657"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DovePress\/statuses\/651859120933330944","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4595376],"posted_on":"2015-10-07T20:38:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Dove Medical Press","url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/692429184925339650\/bBX8nMY7_normal.png","description":"Open access publisher of 130+ peer-reviewed journals across science, tech and medicine.
