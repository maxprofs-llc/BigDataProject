Unfortunately, these animal models are somewhat limited due to their poor clinical translation. We developed a pig model for chronic pain caused by surgically-induced peripheral neuritis trauma (PNT). Seventy five percent of the animals exhibited mechanical and tactile allodynia, which are indicative of painful neuropathy, by day 28 post-surgery. Importantly, the PNT-injured pigs retained their ability to walk or to stand on their injured leg. mRNA analysis of acute inflammatory cytokines CGRP and BDNF at the site of injury suggests transient inflammation followed by a persistent high level of neurological markers. Gabapentin and morphine effectively inhibited hypersensitivity to von Frey filaments, to feather stimuli, and reversed spontaneous pain-related behavior in a dose-related manner. No analgesic effect was detected in PNT-injured pigs following treatment with aprepitant, similarly to observations in humans and contrary to observations in rodents. In conclusion, PNT-induced trauma in pigs may comprise a valid preclinical model for the study of the chronification of peripheral nerve injury and for the study of new pain therapies.\nThis article presents the characterization of a new peripheral neuritis trauma (PNT) model in pigs. The pig PNT model could potentially help close the translational gap between preclinical and clinical responses, and may contribute to improved efficacy and\/or safety of candidate drugs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a84","authors":["Castel, David","Sabbag, Itai","Brenner, Ori","Meilin, Sigal"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jpain.2015.09.011","first_seen_on":"2015-10-07T01:05:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-5900","15265900","1528-8447"],"journal":"Journal of Pain","last_mentioned_on":1444462388,"links":["http:\/\/www.jpain.org\/article\/S1526-5900(15)00886-X\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S152659001500886X&_version=1&md5=23c6bd64230ae0f7ab39bbefda40c3af"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jpain.org\/article\/S152659001500886X\/pdf","pmid":"26456763","pubdate":"2015-10-13T22:00:38+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Peripheral Neuritis Trauma in Pigs: A Neuropathic Pain Model ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/peripheral-neuritis-trauma-pigs-neuropathic-pain-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6240950,"mean":5.9590492029356,"rank":4615002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":937629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6240950,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193183,"mean":10.229220848733,"rank":131480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":41180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193183,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":946,"mean":9.7522095238095,"rank":715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":946,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":29.50119047619,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
