First the design principles for polymer-drug conjugates are discussed followed by two recent developments in the field: a) The design, synthesis and properties of backbone degradable N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer-drug conjugates. The enhanced intravascular half-life of such conjugates creates a concentration gradient (blood vs. tumor) for an extended time interval resulting in increased solid tumor accumulation by enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect with concomitant increase in efficacy. b) Drug-free macromolecular therapeutics is a new paradigm in macromolecular therapeutics. Apoptosis in malignant cell is induced by crosslinking of cell surface non-internalizing receptors. Crosslinking of receptors is mediated by the biorecognition of two nanoconjugates containing high-fidelity complementary motifs (peptides or oligonucleotides). Results for the treatment of B cell lymphomas in animal models and patient cells demonstrate the high translational potential of this aproach.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d37","authors":["Yang, Jiyuan","Kope\u010dek, Jind\u0159ich"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jconrel.2015.10.003","endpage":"23","first_seen_on":"2015-10-06T10:35:31+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci","nigms"],"issns":["1873-4995","01683659"],"journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","last_mentioned_on":1444330488,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26437260?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0168365915301723"],"pmid":"26437260","pubdate":"2015-10-06T22:00:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"9","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Design Of Smart Hpma Copolymer-Based Nanomedicines ","type":"article","volume":"240","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/design-smart-hpma-copolymerbased-nanomedicines"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6242343,"mean":5.9547356396063,"rank":4390799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1625737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6242343,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193546,"mean":10.215249766204,"rank":123037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":61780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193546,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2309,"mean":2.4561048526863,"rank":1107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2309,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":2.7441147540984,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
