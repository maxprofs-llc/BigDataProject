Previous studies have demonstrated that the T3SS in E. amylovora is transcriptionally regulated by an RpoN-HrpL sigma factor cascade, which is activated by the bacterial alarmone (p)ppGpp. In this study, the binding site of HrpS, an enhancer binding protein, was identified for the first time in plant pathogenic bacteria. Complementation of the hrpL mutant with promoter deletion constructs of the hrpL gene and promoter activity analyses using various lengths of the hrpL promoter fused to a promoter-less gfp reporter gene delineated the upstream region for HrpS binding. Sequence analysis revealed a dyad symmetry sequence between -138 to -125 nt (TGCAA-N4-TTGCA) as the potential HrpS binding site, which is conserved in the promoter of the hrpL gene among plant enterobacterial pathogens. Results of qRT-PCR, and electrophoresis mobility shift assay coupled with site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) analysis showed that the intact dyad symmetry sequence was essential for HrpS binding, full activation of T3SS gene expression, and virulence. In addition, the role of the GAYTGA motif (RpoN-binding site) of HrpS in regulating T3SS gene expression in E. amylovora was characterized by complementation of the hrpS mutant using mutant variants generated by SDM. Results showed that an Y100F substitution of HrpS complemented the hrpS mutant, whereas Y100A and Y101A substitutions did not. These results suggest that tyrosine (Y) and phenylalanine (F) function interchangeably in the conserved GAYTGA motif of HrpS in E. amylovora.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000311b","authors":["Lee, Jae Hoon","Sundin, George W.","Zhao, Youfu","Sundin, George W"],"doi":"10.1111\/mpp.12324","endpage":"702","first_seen_on":"2015-10-07T10:09:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1364-3703"],"issue":"5","journal":"Molecular Plant Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1463679364,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/mpp.12324#.VhTaW15o7eA.twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mpp.12324\/abstract?utm_source=hootsuite","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mpp.12324\/abstract?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mpp.12324\/pdf","pmid":"26440313","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"691","subjects":["molecularbiology","botany"],"title":"Identification of the HrpS binding site in the hrpL promoter and effect of the RpoN binding site of HrpS on the regulation of the type III secretion system in Erwinia amylovora","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-hrps-binding-site-hrpl-promoter-effect-rpon-binding-site-hrps-regulation-type-iii-sec"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7719347,"mean":6.622418915792,"rank":3345019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4287804,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7719347,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239279,"mean":9.3606033985571,"rank":93509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":142569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239279,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":775,"mean":4.6172041343669,"rank":458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":775,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":6.84,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
