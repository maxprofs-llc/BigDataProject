The binding data indicated that compounds 1b,d,e,h and 2b,d,e,f,h,i showed a mu-affinity in the low nanomolar range with moderate or negligible affinity towards delta- and kappa-receptors. Selected DTDs, the pairs 1,2b, 1,2e and 1,2h, were also evaluated for analgesic effect. In the hot plate test, only 1b given ip was found to have similar opioid antinociception and chronic tolerance as morphine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f1","authors":["Pinna, G\u00e9rard Aim\u00e8","Cignarella, Giorgio","Ruiu, Stefania","Loriga, Giovanni","Murineddu, Gabriele","Villa, Stefania","Grella, Giuseppe Enrico","Cossu, Gregorio","Fratta, Walter"],"first_seen_on":"2015-10-06T18:48:17+00:00","issns":["0968-0896"],"issue":"18","journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1444156671,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12927864"],"pmid":"12927864","pubdate":"2003-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Synthesis of novel diazatricyclodecanes (DTDs).
