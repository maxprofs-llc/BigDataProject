Our aim was to analyze whether an advanced age affects the beneficial effects of sleeve gastrectomy on weight loss and blood pressure in an experimental model of diet-induced obesity (DIO).\nYoung (6-month-old) and old (18-month-old) male Wistar DIO rats (n\u2009=\u2009101) were subjected to surgical (sham operation and sleeve gastrectomy) or dietary interventions (pair-fed to the amount of food eaten by sleeve gastrectomized animals). Systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean (MBP) blood pressure values and heart rate (HR) were recorded in conscious, resting animals by non-invasive tail-cuff plethysmography before and 4\u00a0weeks after surgical or dietary interventions.\nAging was associated with higher (P\u2009<\u20090.05) body weight and subcutaneous and perirenal fat mass as well as mild cardiac hypertrophy. Sleeve gastrectomy induced a reduction in body weight, whole-body adiposity, and serum total ghrelin in both young and old DIO rats. The younger group achieved a higher excess weight loss than the older group (164\u2009\u00b1\u200960 vs. 82\u2009\u00b1\u200917\u00a0%, P\u2009<\u20090.05). A significant (P\u2009<\u20090.05) decrease in insulin resistance, SBP, DBP, MBP, and HR without changes in heart weight was observed after sleeve gastrectomy independently of age.\nOur results provide evidence for the effectiveness of sleeve gastrectomy without increased operative risk in body weight and blood pressure reduction even in aged animals via endocrine changes that go beyond the mere caloric restriction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f610008357","authors":["Moncada, Rafael","Rodr\u00edguez, Amaia","Becerril, Sara","M\u00e9ndez-Gim\u00e9nez, Leire","Valent\u00ed, V\u00edctor","Ram\u00edrez, Beatriz","Cienfuegos, Javier A","Fern\u00e1ndez, Secundino","Catal\u00e1n, Victoria","G\u00f3mez-Ambrosi, Javier","Fr\u00fchbeck, Gema"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11695-015-1919-9","first_seen_on":"2015-10-07T10:29:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1708-0428"],"journal":"Obesity Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1444213746,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26439733?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26439733","pubdate":"2015-10-07T22:01:04+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["metabolism","generalsurgery"],"title":"Sleeve Gastrectomy Decreases Body Weight, Whole-Body Adiposity, and Blood Pressure Even in Aged Diet-Induced Obese Rats.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sleeve-gastrectomy-decreases-body-weight-wholebody-adiposity-blood-pressure-even-aged-dietinduced-ob"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6265888,"mean":5.9560405915417,"rank":5326438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6265888,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194117,"mean":10.211501040615,"rank":153025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194117,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1583,"mean":2.7571403286979,"rank":1195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1583,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":2.4082962962963,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
