Therefore, its use by the courts to determine competency in such persons can result in an unjust outcome. However, we believe such criticism as Shulman and his coauthors levied at the legal profession should be broadened to consider antiquated and nonscientific terminology in our own field of psychiatry.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5f53cf058f610005e78","authors":["Rodgers, Carla","Baird, John A"],"first_seen_on":"2015-10-07T11:33:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1943-3662"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry & the Law","last_mentioned_on":1470305051,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26438807?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26438807","pubdate":"2015-10-07T22:01:21+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Law","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry","jurisprudence"],"title":"Commentary: The Lucid Interval-Coping with Unscientific Terminology.","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/commentary-lucid-intervalcoping-unscientific-terminology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166192,"mean":6.9129712202356,"rank":7068112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166192,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241751,"mean":9.5365395656669,"rank":200803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241751,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290,"mean":4.1302214532872,"rank":173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.7,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/651721913706745856","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4595883],"posted_on":"2015-10-07T11:33:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":976},"tweet_id":"651721913706745856"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/761140668190175232","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4595883],"posted_on":"2016-08-04T10:04:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":976},"tweet_id":"761140668190175232"}]}}
