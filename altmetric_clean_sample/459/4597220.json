This study examined the effect of early ERT on clinical manifestations.\nThis multinational, retrospective case series abstracted data from records of 20 patients with Hurler-Scheie syndrome within nine sibships that included older siblings treated with laronidase after the development of significant clinical symptoms, and younger siblings treated before significant symptomatology. Median age at diagnosis was 5.6 and 0.5\u00a0years for older and younger siblings, respectively. Median age at ERT initiation was 7.9 and 1.9\u00a0years for older and younger siblings, respectively.\nImprovement or stabilization of somatic signs and symptoms was more notable in younger siblings. Organomegaly present at onset of ERT improved in the majority of both older and younger siblings. Analysis of physician-rated symptom severity demonstrated that cardiac, musculoskeletal, and cognitive symptoms, when absent or mild in younger siblings at ERT initiation, generally did not develop or progress. The majority of older siblings had height\/length Z-scores greater than two standard deviations below the mean (less than -2) at both time points. In general, Z-scores for younger siblings were closer to the sex- and age-matched means at follow-up.\nThese findings suggest early initiation of laronidase, prior to the onset of symptoms in patients with attenuated MPS I, can slow or prevent the development of severe clinical manifestations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000087f","authors":["Nouriya A Al-Sannaa","Luisa Bay","Deborah S Barbouth","Youssef Benhayoun","Cyril Goizet","Norberto Guelbert","Simon A Jones","Sandra O Kyosen","Ana M Martins","Chanika Phornphutkul","Celia Reig","Rebecca Pleat","Shari Fallet","Iva Ivanovska Holder","Nouriya A.
