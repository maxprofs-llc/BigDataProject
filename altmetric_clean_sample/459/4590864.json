We describe how the media represented this research using qualitative thematic analysis of contemporary coverage by daily newspapers in the UK and India. Fifty-four UK and 187 Indian articles mentioned NDM-1, describing it as the 'new super superbug' resistant to most antibiotics. They emphasised the role of medical tourism to the Indian subcontinent. In both countries, blame was framed abstractly as arising from the general misuse of antibiotics. In India, controversy about using New Delhi to name the organism dominated coverage, with officials seeking to discredit the two studies and media coverage characterised by denial and outrage, developing into theories of conspiracies to undermine tourism. Researchers must seek to anticipate the way that their work may be reported and proactively engage with the media to maximise the public health impact of their findings.Journal of Public Health Policy advance online publication, 1 October 2015; doi:10.1057\/jphp.2015.30.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ef0","authors":["Saliba, Vanessa","Washer, Peter","Pett, Philippa","Kakkar, Manish","Abbas, Syed","Raghuvanshi, Bhavna","McKee, Martin","Vanessa Saliba","Peter Washer","Philippa Pett","Manish Kakkar","Syed Abbas","Bhavna Raghuvanshi","Martin McKee"],"doi":"10.1057\/jphp.2015.30","first_seen_on":"2015-10-06T10:20:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1745-655X","0197-5897"],"journal":"Journal of Public Health Policy","last_mentioned_on":1501545600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26424203?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.palgrave-journals.com\/jphp\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/jphp201530a.html","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1057\/jphp.2015.30"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1057%2Fjphp.2015.30.pdf","pmid":"26424203","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan UK","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Policy And Administration","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"A comparative analysis of how the media in the United Kingdom and India represented the emergence of NDM-1","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-analysis-media-united-kingdom-india-represented-emergence-ndm1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.95,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302353,"mean":6.9982161057411,"rank":1452465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6846027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302353,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242930,"mean":9.5561135475796,"rank":49785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":192973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242930,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":451,"mean":8.0350133333333,"rank":139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":451,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":10.041428571429,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1,"GB":2},"mendeley":{"GB":1,"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ndm1bacteria\/statuses\/651341153153847296","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4590864],"posted_on":"2015-10-06T10:20:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Dave Roberts","url":"http:\/\/www.ndm1bacteria.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1294321879\/713px-EscherichiaColi_NIAID_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"ndm1bacteria","tweeter_id":"177368473","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":545},"tweet_id":"651341153153847296"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rczi_phfi\/statuses\/653502527195910145","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4590864],"posted_on":"2015-10-12T09:28:38+00:00","author":{"name":"RCZI_PHFI","url":"http:\/\/zoonoses.phfi.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/599062818667700224\/XLr2LvDQ_normal.jpg","description":"Roadmap to Combat Zoonoses in India: A multisectoral initiative for 'integrated' prevention and control of zoonoses | The Public Health Foundation of India|","id_on_source":"rczi_phfi","tweeter_id":"3195914864","geo":{"lt":28.63576,"ln":77.22445,"country":"IN"},"followers":92},"tweet_id":"653502527195910145"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/abs014\/statuses\/653507892704841729","license":"gnip","rt":["rczi_phfi"],"citation_ids":[4590864],"posted_on":"2015-10-12T09:49:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Syed Abbas","url":"http:\/\/www.ids.ac.uk\/person\/syed-abbas","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/489697809684127745\/XchaZ02O_normal.jpeg","description":"Researcher @IDS_UK @commschols & @thePHFI; working on #HealthPolicy, #MultisectoralGovernance and #zoonoses in #India.
