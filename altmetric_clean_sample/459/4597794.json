T2Ds (61 \u00b1 7 y old) were older (P < 0.001) than were OBEs (31 \u00b1 7 y old) and CONs (28 \u00b1 3 y old). We quantified hepatic \u03b3ATP, inorganic phosphate (Pi), and the fat content [hepatocellular lipids (HCLs)] with the use of (31)P\/(1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and at 160 and 240 min after a high-caloric mixed meal. In a subset of volunteers, we measured the skeletal muscle oxidative capacity with the use of high-resolution respirometry. Whole-body insulin sensitivity (M value) was assessed with the use of hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps.\nOBEs and T2Ds were similarly insulin resistant (M value: 3.5 \u00b1 1.4 vs. 1.9 \u00b1 2.5 mg \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 min(-1), respectively; P = 0.9) and had 12-fold (P = 0.01) and 17-fold (P = 0.002) higher HCLs than those of lean persons. Despite comparable fasting hepatic \u03b3ATP concentrations, the maximum postprandial increase of \u03b3ATP was 6-fold higher in OBEs (0.7 \u00b1 0.2 mmol\/L; P = 0.03) but only tended to be higher in T2Ds (0.6 \u00b1 0.2 mmol\/L; P = 0.09) than in CONs (0.1 \u00b1 0.1 mmol\/L). However, in the fasted state, muscle complex I activity was 53% lower (P = 0.01) in T2Ds but not in OBEs (P = 0.15) than in CONs.\nYoung, obese, nondiabetic humans exhibit augmented postprandial hepatic energy metabolism, whereas elderly T2Ds have impaired fasting muscle energy metabolism. These findings support the concept of a differential and tissue-specific regulation of energy metabolism, which can occur independent of insulin resistance. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01229059.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005700","authors":["Fritsch, Maria","Koliaki, Chrysi","Livingstone, Roshan","Phielix, Esther","Bierwagen, Alessandra","Meisinger, Markus","Jelenik, Tomas","Strassburger, Klaus","Zimmermann, Stefanie","Brockmann, Katharina","Wolff, Christina","Hwang, Jong-Hee","Szendroedi, Julia","Roden, Michael"],"doi":"10.3945\/ajcn.115.107599","first_seen_on":"2015-10-07T19:39:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1938-3207"],"journal":"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1455027444,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26423389","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26423389?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26423389","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Time course of postprandial hepatic phosphorus metabolites in lean, obese, and type 2 diabetes patients.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/time-course-postprandial-hepatic-phosphorus-metabolites-lean-obese-type-2-diabetes-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7156405,"mean":6.3086437613049,"rank":3330028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3768269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7156405,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236201,"mean":9.2663015834039,"rank":108386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":125613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236201,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5532,"mean":23.267126378593,"rank":4134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5532,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":37.000561797753,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JonMcGavock\/statuses\/651844144696967168","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4597794],"posted_on":"2015-10-07T19:38:49+00:00","author":{"name":"JonMcGavock","url":"http:\/\/www.jonmcgavock.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2877767060\/98f0cc719ba9ef89cfd3c93e81bf62e5_normal.jpeg","description":"CIHR Applied Health Chair in Obesity and Resilience in Youth.
