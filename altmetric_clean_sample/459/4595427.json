How gelsolin affects the MS brain has not been studied. We found that while the secreted form of gelsolin (pGSN) decreased in the blood of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice, pGSN concentration increased in the EAE brain. Recombinant human pGSN (rhp-GSN) decreased extracellular actin and myeloperoxidase activity in the brain, resulting in reduced disease activity and less severe clinical disease, suggesting that gelsolin could be a potential therapeutic target for MS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e75","authors":["Kevin Li-Chun, Hsieh","Schob, Stefan","Zeller, Matthias W G","Pulli, Benjamin","Ali, Muhammad","Wang, Cuihua","Chiou, Terry Ting-Yu","Tsang, Yuk-Ming","Lee, Po-Shun","Stossel, Thomas P","Chen, John W"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jneuroim.2015.08.006","first_seen_on":"2015-10-07T10:27:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-8421"],"journal":"Journal of Neuroimmunology","last_mentioned_on":1452382474,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26439960?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26439960","pubdate":"2015-10-07T22:00:57+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Gelsolin decreases actin toxicity and inflammation in murine multiple sclerosis.","type":"article","volume":"287","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gelsolin-decreases-actin-toxicity-inflammation-murine-multiple-sclerosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6922153,"mean":6.2167633701173,"rank":4915450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1759300,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6922153,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235144,"mean":9.2294867463629,"rank":144879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":74653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235144,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":829,"mean":2.8396690821256,"rank":511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":829,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":2.8236216216216,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
