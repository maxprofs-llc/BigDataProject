High uric acid (UA) has been found to be correlated with renal dysfunction in some experimental and clinical studies; however, the study of the dynamic correlation between AKI and UA in severe burns is still lacking.\nThe diagnosis and classification of AKI were performed according to RIFLE criteria, UA, serum creatinine (Scr), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactic acid (LA) were dynamically monitored within 2 days after injury in 59 severely burned patients.\nWithin 2 days after injury, AKI occurred in 23 of 59 patients (risk in 12 cases, injury in seven cases and failure in four cases), UA level in AKI patients was significantly higher than that in No-AKI patients, and referring to the cutoff level of UA (375.5\u03bcmol\/l) from ROC curve for predicting AKI, the abnormal increase of UA levels was earlier than acute deterioration of renal function in most of the AKI patients after injury. Among AKI patients, the Scr\/eGFR levels were closely related to UA levels for 2 days after injury. Moreover, UA level in cases with severe grade of AKI was significantly higher than that in those with less severe grade of AKI. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between UA and CRP for 2 days after injury in AKI patients, and a significant correlation between CRP and Scr\/eGFR was found 1 day after injury. The positive correlation was also found between LA and UA after injury in AKI patients.\nThe results suggest that elevated serum UA after injury due to hypoxia is closely correlated with early AKI after severe burns, and UA-related aberrant inflammation also appears to be one of the pathogenic factors, providing the useful information for potential therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000247d","authors":["Liang, Juan","Zhang, Ping","Hu, Xinlei","Zhi, Lizhu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.burns.2015.09.001","first_seen_on":"2015-10-07T15:41:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1409"],"journal":"Burns (03054179)","last_mentioned_on":1444232493,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26440305?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26440305","pubdate":"2015-10-07T22:00:49+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Elevated serum uric acid after injury correlates with the early acute kidney in severe burns.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/elevated-serum-uric-acid-after-injury-correlates-early-acute-kidney-severe-burns"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6265888,"mean":5.9560405915417,"rank":5326434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6265888,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194117,"mean":10.211537503349,"rank":153024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194117,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":602,"mean":5.3496372712146,"rank":449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":602,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.5909090909091,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
