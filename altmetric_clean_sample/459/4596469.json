Bound-form Lpp is known to interact with the periplasmic bacterial cell wall, while free-form Lpp is localized to the bacterial cell surface. A function for surface-exposed Lpp has yet to be determined. We hypothesized that the presence of C-terminal lysinses in the surface-exposed region of Lpp would facilitate binding to the host zymogen plasminogen (Plg), a protease commandeered by a number of clinically important bacteria. Recombinant Lpp was synthesized and the binding of Lpp to Plg, the effect of various inhibitors on this binding, and the effects of various mutations of Lpp on Lpp-Plg interactions were examined. Additionally, the ability of Lpp-bound Plg to be converted to active plasmin was analyzed. We determined that Lpp binds Plg via an atypical domain located near the center of mature Lpp that may not be exposed on the surface of intact E. coli according to the current localization model. Finally, we found that Plg bound by Lpp can be converted to active plasmin. While the consequences of Lpp binding Plg are unclear, these results prompt further investigation of the ability of surface exposed Lpp to interact with host molecules such as extracellular matrix components and complement regulators, and the role of these interactions in infections caused by E. coli and other bacteria.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc10","authors":["Gonzalez, Tammy","Gaultney, Robert A.","Floden, Angela M.","Brissette, Catherine A."],"doi":"10.3389\/fmicb.2015.01095","first_seen_on":"2015-10-07T14:02:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-302X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1444226528,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fmicb.2015.01095\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fmicb.2015.01095\/pdf","pmid":"26500634","pubdate":"2015-10-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Escherichia coli lipoprotein binds human plasminogen via an intramolecular domain","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/escherichia-coli-lipoprotein-binds-human-plasminogen-via-intramolecular-domain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6255293,"mean":5.9546802157296,"rank":5316453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6255293,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193655,"mean":10.214383994134,"rank":152512,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193655,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4402,"mean":3.7547639172915,"rank":3402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4402,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":432,"mean":2.9580092807425,"rank":338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":432,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FrontMicrobiol\/statuses\/651759416467783680","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4596469],"posted_on":"2015-10-07T14:02:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Frontiers Microbiol","url":"http:\/\/frontiersin.org\/Microbiology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/533288470416863233\/oirZbiiG_normal.jpeg","description":"Frontiers in Microbiology is the largest open-access journal in the field of Microbiology.","id_on_source":"FrontMicrobiol","tweeter_id":"397317974","geo":{"lt":46.516,"ln":6.63282,"country":"CH"},"followers":3626},"tweet_id":"651759416467783680"}]}}
