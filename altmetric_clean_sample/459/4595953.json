In this work, we provide insights into the effect of surface coating on upconversion enhancement by comparatively investigating NaYF4:Yb\/Er nanoparticles and the corresponding NaYF4:Yb\/Er@NaYF4 core-shell nanoparticles as a function of dopant concentration of Yb3+ and excitation power. We observe a declining emission enhancement factors with decreasing the Yb3+ concentration and increasing the excitation power. Our mechanistic investigations suggest that the phenomenon originates from the stepwise excitation in the upconversion process as well as energy hopping among the Yb3+ dopants. The advances in understanding the effect of surface coating on upconversion should be an important step towards the rational design of lanthanide-doped core-shell nanoparticles for various applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dda","authors":["Sun, Tianying","Ma, Ronghua","Qiao, Xvsheng","Fan, Xianping","Wang, Feng"],"doi":"10.1002\/cphc.201500724","endpage":"770","first_seen_on":"2015-10-07T11:51:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1439-7641"],"issue":"5","journal":"ChemPhysChem","last_mentioned_on":1444218700,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/cphc.201500724"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201500724\/pdf","pmid":"26420655","pubdate":"2015-10-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
