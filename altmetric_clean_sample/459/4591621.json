How such cooling competes with global warming has long been a topic for speculation, but was never addressed using a climate model. Here it is shown that global cooling due to a collapsing AMOC obliterates global warming for a period of 15-20 years. Thereafter, the global mean temperature trend is reversed and becomes similar to a simulation without an AMOC collapse. The resulting surface warming hiatus lasts for 40-50 years. Global warming and AMOC-induced NH cooling are governed by similar feedbacks, giving rise to a global net radiative imbalance of similar sign, although the former is associated with surface warming, the latter with cooling. Their footprints in outgoing longwave and absorbed shortwave radiation are very distinct, making attribution possible.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Sybren Drijfhout"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep14877","first_seen_on":"2015-10-06T12:37:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1507008995,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep14877","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/srep14877","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep14877#close","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep14877?utm_source=Daily+Carbon+Briefing&utm_campaign=c74099cbf9-cb_daily&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_876aab4fd7-c74099cbf9-303424157","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4594299\/","http:\/\/www.readcube.com\/articles\/10.1038%2Fsrep14877","https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep14877"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep14877.pdf","pmid":"26437599","pubdate":"2015-10-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Climate sciences","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Climate and Earth system modelling","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"14877","subjects":["science"],"title":"Competition between global warming and an abrupt collapse of the AMOC in Earth\u2019s energy imbalance","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/competition-between-global-warming-abrupt-collapse-amoc-earths-energy-imbalance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":291.08,"score_history":{"1y":14.75,"6m":2.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0.75,"1w":0.5,"6d":0.5,"5d":0.5,"4d":0.5,"3d":0.5,"2d":0.5,"1d":0.5,"at":291.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454394,"mean":7.1050695771928,"rank":22071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":8432337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454394,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243626,"mean":9.5760768722421,"rank":1012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":242614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243626,"percentile":99},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37801,"mean":14.765450634921,"rank":284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":37517,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37801,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2082,"mean":14.305094666026,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":2066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2082,"percentile":99}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":31,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":31,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
