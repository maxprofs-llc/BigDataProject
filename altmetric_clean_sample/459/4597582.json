This study further examined the effects of long-term AMC training on math ability in visual-spatial domain and the task switching component of executive function. More importantly, this study investigated whether AMC training modulated the relationship between math abilities and task switching. The participants were seventy 7-year-old children who were randomly assigned into AMC and control groups at primary school entry. Children in AMC group received 2-hour AMC training every week since primary school entry. On the contrary, children in the control group had never received any AMC training. Math and task switching abilities were measured one year and three years respectively after AMC training began. The results showed that AMC children performed better than their peers on math abilities in arithmetical and visual-spatial domains. In addition, AMC group responded faster than control group in the switching task, while no group difference was found in switch cost. Most interestingly, group difference was present in the relationships between math abilities and switch cost. These results implied the effect of AMC training on math abilities as well as its relationship with executive function.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Chunjie Wang","Fengji Geng","Yuan Yao","Jian Weng","Yuzheng Hu","Feiyan Chen"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0139930","first_seen_on":"2015-10-07T18:47:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"10","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1485882282,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0139930","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0139930&utm_content=buffer08050&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0139930.PDF","pmid":"26444689","pubdate":"2015-10-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0139930","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Abacus Training Affects Math and Task Switching Abilities and Modulates Their Relationships in Chinese Children","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0139930","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/abacus-training-affects-math-task-switching-abilities-modulates-relationships-chinese-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11,"score_history":{"1y":10,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8439927,"mean":7.0978907431096,"rank":793528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7636444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8439927,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243329,"mean":9.5763616517621,"rank":31334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":211674,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243329,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116281,"mean":10.665248245614,"rank":16549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":99572,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116281,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5792,"mean":9.5828817130029,"rank":720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":5062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5792,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
