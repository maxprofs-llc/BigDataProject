However, recent findings with pharmacological approaches highlight the non-specificity of commonly used inhibitors. This suggests that caution is required for interpreting these studies and that the use of pharmacological agents is a \"double edged\" tool. On one hand, non-specific effects make interpretation difficult unless other experiments, such as with different mutants or with multiple diversely acting chemicals, are conducted. On the other hand, the non-specificity of inhibitors opens up the possibility of uncovering some ligands or modulators of new receptors such as plant glutamate-like receptors and importance of some metabolic hubs in carbon and nitrogen metabolism involved in the regulation of the root morphogenetic program. Identification of such targets is a critical issue to improve the efficiency of absorption of macronutrients in relation with root morphogenetic program. This article is protected by copyright.
