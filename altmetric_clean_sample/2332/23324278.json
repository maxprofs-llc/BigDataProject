Tryptohanyl radicals have been observed both in their protonated cation form and in their unprotonated neutral form, but to date tyrosyl radicals have only been observed in their unprotonated form. With a genetically modified form of the flavoenzyme TrmFO as a suitable model system and using ultrafast fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy, we characterize its protonated precursor TyrOH\u25cf+, and we show this species to have a distinct visible absorption band and a transition moment that we suggest to lie close to the phenol symmetry axis. TyrOH\u25cf+ is formed in ~1 ps by electron transfer to excited flavin and decays in ~3 ps by charge recombination. These findings imply that TyrOH oxidation does not necessarily induce its concerted deprotonation. Our results will allow disentangling of photoproduct states in flavoproteins in often-encountered complex situations and more generally are important for understanding redox chains relying on tyrosyl intermediates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Lipsa Nag","Pierre Sournia","Hannu Myllykallio","Ursula Liebl","Marten H Vos"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.7b04586","first_seen_on":"2017-07-31T19:19:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1501528746,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.7b04586"],"pmid":"28745052","publisher":" American Chemical Society ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Identification of the TyrOH\u25cf+ radical cation in the flavoenzyme TrmFO","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-tyroh-radical-cation-flavoenzyme-trmfo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302353,"mean":6.9982161057411,"rank":4419414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2311351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302353,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171594,"mean":11.588085224922,"rank":93636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":61190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171594,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19186,"mean":5.2910647902007,"rank":13035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":4005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19186,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184,"mean":9.5884918032787,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Ph.
