Without the correction, commonly used density functionals based on the generalized gradient approximation as well as hybrid functionals fail to give a bound ground state of the anion. A HOMO orbital energy of -0.013 eV is obtained using the self-interaction corrected PBE functional in good correspondence with the experimentally estimated binding energy of 0.019 eV. The dipole bound electron polarizes the CH3CN molecule and increases its dipole moment by 7% to 4.2 D. Because the computational effort increases slowly with system size, as the number of electrons cubed, the results presented here point to a viable approach to theoretical studies of dipole bound electrons in large and complex systems such as molecular clusters, biological systems and solvated electrons.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dea","authors":["Yao Zhang"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpclett.6b00742","first_seen_on":"2016-05-20T16:48:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1948-7185"],"journal":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters","last_mentioned_on":1463762919,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jpclett.6b00742"],"pmid":"27166989","pubdate":"2016-05-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"title":"Self-Interaction Corrected Functional Calculations of a Dipole Bound Molecular Anion","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selfinteraction-corrected-functional-calculations-dipolebound-molecular-anion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7722452,"mean":6.6241115612059,"rank":6680808,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7722452,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268593,"mean":11.459995688628,"rank":224085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268593,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2183,"mean":3.4121466544455,"rank":1389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2183,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127,"mean":3.0946825396825,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
