In July 2001, the Victorian Department of Human Services implemented an enhanced surveillance system focusing on improved laboratory testing. We tested 85% of notifications and only 9% of all mumps and 27% of rubella notifications were laboratory confirmed. While most notified cases were children who had been clinically diagnosed, we found most laboratory-confirmed cases were in adults. The positive predictive value of the clinical case definition was low: mumps (10%); rubella (22%). These results highlight the value of laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis when mumps and rubella are rare, failure to do so is likely to overestimate disease incidence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006544","authors":["Guy, R J","Andrews, R M","Kelly, H A","Leydon, J A","Riddell, M A","Lambert, S B","Catton, M G","R.
