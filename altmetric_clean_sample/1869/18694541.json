Here, we extend our study and demonstrate that knockdown of TPC2 with a non-overlapping splice-blocking MO, knockout of TPC2 (via the generation of a tpcn2(dhkz1a) mutant line of zebrafish using CRISPR\/Cas9 gene-editing), or the pharmacological inhibition of TPC2 action with bafilomycin A1 or trans-ned-19, also lead to a significant attenuation of SMC differentiation, characterized by a disruption of SMC myofibrillogenesis and gross morphological changes in the trunk musculature. When the morphants were injected with tpcn2-mRNA or were treated with IP3\/BM or caffeine (agonists of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and ryanodine receptor (RyR), respectively), many aspects of myofibrillogenesis and myotomal patterning (and in the case of the pharmacological treatments, the Ca(2+) signals generated in the SMCs), were rescued. STED super-resolution microscopy revealed a close physical relationship between clusters of RyR in the terminal cisternae of the SR, and TPC2 in lysosomes, with a mean estimated separation of ~52-87nm. Our data therefore add to the increasing body of evidence, which indicate that localized Ca(2+) release via TPC2 might trigger the generation of more global Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026ee","authors":["Kelu, Jeffrey J.","Webb, Sarah E.","Parrington, John","Galione, Antony","Miller, Andrew L."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ydbio.2017.03.031","first_seen_on":"2017-04-10T10:03:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0012-1606","00121606","1095-564X"],"journal":"Developmental Biology","last_mentioned_on":1491842376,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28390800?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28390800?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0012160616308211"],"pmid":"28390800","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["embryology","biology"],"title":"Ca 2+  release via two-pore channel type 2 (TPC2) is required for slow muscle cell myofibrillogenesis and myotomal patterning in intact zebrafish embryos","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ca2-release-via-twopore-channel-type-2-tpc2-required-slow-muscle-cell-myofibrillogenesis-myotomal-pa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":2.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8038089,"mean":6.8236667777181,"rank":3347391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4639907,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8038089,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235667,"mean":12.850109434539,"rank":92561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":140698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235667,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2319,"mean":3.0923684210526,"rank":1021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2319,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":2.2916666666667,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SRMicro_papers\/statuses\/851375032542658561","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18694541],"posted_on":"2017-04-10T10:03:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Super Res Microscopy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/789566896286728192\/otGAZOp0_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot for anything related to super resolution microscopy","id_on_source":"SRMicro_papers","tweeter_id":"2372788392","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":514},"tweet_id":"851375032542658561"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TC_papers\/statuses\/851424176292323329","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18694541],"posted_on":"2017-04-10T13:18:36+00:00","author":{"name":"TC_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507539334375829504\/IcPjrJI3_normal.jpeg","description":"Pubmed twitterbot: arealization OR patterning OR somatosensory OR thalamus OR thalamocortical OR cortical development","id_on_source":"TC_papers","tweeter_id":"2789910212","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":178},"tweet_id":"851424176292323329"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jonmoulton\/statuses\/851474693479571456","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18694541],"posted_on":"2017-04-10T16:39:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Jon D.
