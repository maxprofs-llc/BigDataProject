The goal of the present study was to investigate the autonomic dysfunction in patients with SS, and the associations between autonomic dysfunction, anti- gAChR antibodies, and clinical features of SS.\n1) The first observational study tested for the presence of gAChR antibodies in the serum samples from 39 patients with SS (absent information regarding autonomic symptoms) and healthy volunteers. 2) In the second study, serological and clinical data from 10 Japanese patients diagnosed with SS were reviewed. These patients showed autonomic dysfunction, and luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) test was conducted to detect anti-\u03b13 and -\u03b24 gAChR antibodies. 3) In the final analysis, we combined the data of seropositive SS patients with autonomic symptom from the first study with all of the patients from the second study, and analyzed the clinical features.\n1) The LIPS assay revealed that anti-gAChR\u03b13 and anti-gAChR\u03b24 antibodies were detected in the sera from patients with SS (23.1%, 9\/39). Five of 9 SS patients had autonomic symptoms. 2) Anti-\u03b13 and -\u03b24 gAChR antibodies were also detected in 80.0% (8\/10) of patients with SS with autonomic symptoms. Six of the 10 patients were diagnosed as having SS after neurological symptoms developed. These seropositive patients had predominant and severe autonomic symptoms and were diagnosed with autonomic neuropathy. 3) In 13 of 15 SS patients with autonomic symptoms (86.7%) were seropositive for anti-gAChR antibodies, and we confirmed sicca complex, orthostatic hypotension, upper and lower GI symptoms, and bladder dysfunction at high rates.\nThe present results suggest the possibility of anti-gAChR antibodies aiding the diagnostics of SS with autonomic dysfunction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310a","authors":["Akihiro Mukaino"],"doi":"10.3109\/14397595.2016.1147404","first_seen_on":"2016-02-24T09:14:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1439-7609"],"journal":"Modern Rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1456131428,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3109\/14397595.2016.1147404","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/14397595.2016.1147404#.VsrLJwz4gaU.facebook"],"pmid":"26873295","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Insights from the ganglionic acetylcholine receptor autoantibodies in patients with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/insights-ganglionic-acetylcholine-receptor-autoantibodies-patients-sj%C3%B6grens-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7229418,"mean":6.3648808956484,"rank":6236085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7229418,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283034,"mean":10.411124384789,"rank":237694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283034,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260,"mean":1.3430888030888,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.57142857142857,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Insights from the ganglionic acetylcholine receptor autoantibodies in patients with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=938503672884437&id=508367122564763","license":"public","citation_ids":[5984100,5984100],"posted_on":"2016-02-22T08:57:08+00:00","summary":"\u30b7\u30a7\u30fc\u30b0\u30ec\u30f3\u75c7\u5019\u7fa4\uff08SS\uff09\u3067\u306f\u795e\u7d4c\u7cfb\u306e\u5408\u4f75\u75c7\u304c\u8d77\u3053\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u77e5\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\uff0c\u3053\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u3067\u306f\u305d\u306e\u306a\u304b\u3067\u3082\u81ea\u5f8b\u795e\u7d4c\u969c\u5bb3\u3068\u6297\u81ea\u5f8b\u795e\u7d4c\u7bc0\u30a2\u30bb\u30c1\u30eb\u30b3\u30ea\u30f3\u53d7\u5bb9\u4f53\uff08gAChR\uff09\u6297\u4f53\u306b\u7740\u76ee\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff0e\n\u3072\u3068\u3064\u3081\u306e\u30b3\u30db\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u306fSS\u75c7\u4f8b\uff08\u81ea\u5f8b\u795e\u7d4c\u969c\u5bb3\u306e\u6709\u7121\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306f\u4e0d\u660e\u306e\u72b6\u614b\u3067\uff09\u304b\u3089\u306e\u8840\u6e05\u3092\u7528\u3044\u3066\u6297gAChR\u6297\u4f53\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3057\uff0c\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306b\u81ea\u5f8b\u795e\u7d4c\u75c7\u72b6\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u691c\u8a0e\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff0e\u81a0\u539f\u75c5\u5c02\u9580\u533b\u5e2b\u3068\u306e\u30b3\u30e9\u30dc\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u3059\uff0e\n\u3075\u305f\u3064\u3081\u306e\u30b3\u30db\u30fc\u30c8\u306f\u5168\u56fd\u304b\u3089SS\u3067\u81ea\u5f8b\u795e\u7d4c\u969c\u5bb3\u3092\u5448\u3057\u305f\u75c7\u4f8b\u306e\u81e8\u5e8a\u50cf\u89e3\u6790\u3068\u6297gAChR\u6297\u4f53\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3092\u884c\u3063\u305f\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3059\uff0e\u3053\u308c\u306f","author":{"name":"\u9577\u5d0e\u5ddd\u68da\u533b\u7642\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u795e\u7d4c\u5185\u79d1\u30fb\u81e8\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u90e8","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/508367122564763","facebook_wall_name":"\u9577\u5d0e\u5ddd\u68da\u533b\u7642\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u795e\u7d4c\u5185\u79d1\u30fb\u81e8\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u90e8","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/508367122564763\/picture","id_on_source":"508367122564763"}}]}}
