Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) were examined. Patients were randomly separated into two groups: Group L, 15 mg isobaric levobupivacaine application and Group B, 15 mg isobaric bupivacaine application, for spinal anaesthesia. Otoacoustic emission measurements were repeated on patients at the 24th hour after spinal anaesthesia application.\nNo significant difference was found in the output values of right and left ears according to the input values in group L at no kHz (p > 0.05). No significant difference was found in the output values of right and left ears according to the input values in other kHz of group B (p > 0.05).\nFifteen milligrams of isobaric bupivacaine and levobupivacaine had no significant difference on the effect of hearing loss after spinal anaesthesia. Hearing loss after spinal anaesthesia has many unknown issues, and deserves to be explored by performing many studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005d3f","authors":["Sitilci, T","Akyol, O","Alkan, Z","Ozyuvaci, E","Yigit, O"],"doi":"10.7727\/wimj.2014.240","first_seen_on":"2016-02-24T12:22:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0043-3144"],"issue":"1","journal":"West Indian Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1456312275,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26901610?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26901610","pubdate":"2015-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Effects of Different Local Anaesthetics on Otoacoustic Emission Tests After Spinal Anaesthesia","type":"article","volume":"65"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7269211,"mean":6.3660833867746,"rank":6275411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7269211,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283157,"mean":10.419466732119,"rank":237935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283157,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187,"mean":2.016311827957,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.1666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/702450711741624320","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5985952],"posted_on":"2016-02-24T11:11:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
