Images and descriptive data were used to characterise cases of screen-detection with tomosynthesis, sourced from prospective screening trials that performed standard (2D) digital mammography (DM) and tomosynthesis (3D-mammography) in the same screening participants. Exemplar cases from four trials highlight common themes of relevance to screening practice including: the type of lesions frequently made more conspicuous or perceptible by tomosynthesis (spiculated masses, and architectural distortions); the histologic findings (both TP and FP) of tomosynthesis-only detection; and the need to extend breast work-up protocols (additional imaging including ultrasound and MRI, and tomosynthesis-guided biopsy) if tomosynthesis is adopted for primary screening.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006cfb","authors":["Nehmat Houssami","Kristina L\u00e5ng","Daniela Bernardi","Alberto Tagliafico","Sophia Zackrisson","Per Skaane","Houssami, Nehmat","L\u00e5ng, Kristina","Bernardi, Daniela","Tagliafico, Alberto","Zackrisson, Sophia","Skaane, Per"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.breast.2016.01.007","endpage":"134","first_seen_on":"2016-02-24T06:44:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09609776","1532-3080"],"journal":"The Breast","last_mentioned_on":1462981852,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0960977616000126","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27017251?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0960977616000126?sf25547912=1"],"pmid":"27017251","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"119","subjects":["neoplasms","endocrinology"],"title":"Digital breast tomosynthesis (3D-mammography) screening: A pictorial review of screen-detected cancers and false recalls attributed to tomosynthesis in prospective screening trials ","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/digital-breast-tomosynthesis-3dmammography-screening-pictorial-review-screendetected-cancers-false-r"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7684314,"mean":6.5948576928038,"rank":3211423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4361912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7684314,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286292,"mean":10.537452235662,"rank":113519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":167265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286292,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":585,"mean":3.1997431506849,"rank":223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":585,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":3.4428571428571,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
