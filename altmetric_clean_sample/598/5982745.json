Only trials that compared radiofrequency ablation and liver resection for single very early stage (\u22642 cm) or early stage (\u22643 cm) HCC according to the Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) staging system were considered for inclusion in this review. The primary outcomes that we analyzed were the 3-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates, and the secondary outcomes that we analyzed were the 3-year and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates. Review Manager 5.3 was used to perform a cumulative meta-analysis. Possible publication bias was examined using a funnel plot. A random-effects model was applied to summarize the various outcomes.\nSix studies involving 947 patients were identified that compared radiofrequency ablation (n=528) to liver resection (n=419) for single BCLC very early HCC. In these six studies, the rates of 3-year OS, 5-year OS, 3-year DFS, and 5-year DFS were significantly lower in the radiofrequency ablation group than in the liver resection group (risk ratio [RR] =0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-0.98, P=0.01; RR =0.84, 95% CI: 0.75-0.95, P=0.004; RR =0.77, 95% CI: 0.60-0.98, P=0.04; and RR =0.70, 95% CI: 0.52-0.94, P=0.02, respectively). Ten studies involving 2,501 patients were identified that compared radiofrequency ablation (n=1,476) to liver resection (n=1,025) for single BCLC early HCC. In these ten studies, the rates of 3-year OS, 5-year OS, 3-year DFS, and 5-year DFS were also significantly lower in the radiofrequency ablation group than in the liver resection group (RR =0.93, 95% CI: 0.88-0.98, P=0.003; RR =0.84, 95% CI: 0.75-0.94, P=0.002; RR =0.72, 95% CI: 0.58-0.89, P=0.002; and RR =0.47, 95% CI: 0.33-0.67, P<0.0001, respectively).\nThe long-term survival outcomes for patients with single BCLC very early\/early stage HCC appear to be superior after liver resection compared to radiofrequency ablation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b5e","authors":["Wei Zhang","Zhenxin He","Pu Xiang","Jianping Gong","Nansheng Cheng","He, Zhen-Xin","Xiang, Pu","Gong, Jian-Ping","Cheng, Nan-Sheng","Zhang, Wei"],"doi":"10.2147\/tcrm.s96760","first_seen_on":"2016-02-24T05:52:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-203X","1176-6336"],"journal":"Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management","last_mentioned_on":1457787431,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/radiofrequency-ablation-versus-resection-for-barcelona-clinic-liver-ca-peer-reviewed-article-TCRM","https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/radiofrequency-ablation-versus-resection-for-barcelona-clinic-liver-ca-peer-reviewed-article-TCRM?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26966370?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=29119","pmid":"26966370","pubdate":"2016-02-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Social Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"295","title":"Radiofrequency ablation versus resection for Barcelona clinic liver cancer very early\/early stage hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/radiofrequency-ablation-versus-resection-barcelona-clinic-liver-cancer-very-earlyearly-stage-hepatoc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7382271,"mean":6.4142077767366,"rank":1588279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5781369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7382271,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283659,"mean":10.440773600603,"rank":78804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":204212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283659,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":637,"mean":3.6522075471698,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":637,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":2.159298245614,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4,"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
