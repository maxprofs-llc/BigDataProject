The majority of nosocomial infections in horses is obviously associated with particular MRSA clonal lineages. As already observed for epidemic MRSA in human hospitals more than 10 years ago, a dynamics of MRSA clonal lineages is also observed in European equine clinics: clonal lineages belonging to clonal complex (CC) 8 are on the retreat whereas MRSA attributed to CC398 become increasingly prevalent. The majority of CC398 isolates belong to a subpopulation which is particularly associated with equine hospitals as indicated by molecular typing. When emerging in equine clinics, MRSA from horses were also found as nasal colonizers of veterinary personnel. MRSA exhibiting the typing characteristics of MRSA known from equine clinics are obviously rare among MRSA from infections in humans. Although rare so far epidemic MRSA from human hospitals (HA-MRSA, e.g., ST22, ST225) have been isolated from nosocomial infections in horses and need particular attention in further surveillance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fb","authors":["Cuny, Christiane","Witte, Wolfgang","Christiane Cuny","Wolfgang Witte"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vetmic.2016.01.013","first_seen_on":"2016-02-24T08:36:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2542","03781135"],"journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1506939668,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26869097?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26869097","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26869097"],"pmid":"26869097","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"MRSA in equine hospitals and its significance for infections in humans.  - PubMed - NCBI","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mrsa-equine-hospitals-significance-infections-humans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":1,"6d":1,"5d":1,"4d":1,"3d":1,"2d":1,"1d":1,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8458514,"mean":7.1060811494801,"rank":3679919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4657000,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8458514,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290474,"mean":10.806808763637,"rank":116524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":168516,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290474,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1470,"mean":2.2539400953029,"rank":551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":904,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1470,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":2.2851515151515,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
