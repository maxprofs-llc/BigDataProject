Maize (Zea mays) HDAC HDA101 influences several aspects of development, including kernel size; however, the molecular mechanism by which HDA101 affects kernel development remains unknown. In this study, we find HDA101 regulates the expression of transfer cell-specific genes, suggesting their mis-regulation may be associated with defects in differentiation of transfer cells and smaller kernels of hda101 mutants. To investigate HDA101 function during early stages of seed development, we performed genome-wide mapping of HDA101 binding sites. We observed that HDA101 mainly targets highly and intermediately expressed genes. Although loss of HDA101 can induce histone hyper-acetylation of its direct targets, this often does not involve variation in transcription. A small subset of inactive genes that must be negatively regulated during kernel development are also targeted by HDA101 and its loss leads to hyper-acetylation and increased expression of these genes. Finally, we report HDA101 interacts with members of different chromatin remodeling complexes, such as NFC103\/MSI1 and SNL1\/SIN3-like co-repressors. Taken together, our results reveal a complex genetic network regulated by HDA101 during seed development and provide insights into the different mechanisms of HDA101-mediated regulation of transcriptionally active and inactive genes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003335","authors":["Hua Yang","Xinye Liu","Mingming Xin","Jinkun Du","Zhaorong Hu","Huiru Peng","Vincenzo Rossi","Qixin Sun","Zhongfu Ni","Yingyin Yao","Yang, Hua","Liu, Xinye","Xin, Mingming","Du, Jinkun","Hu, Zhaorong","Peng, Huiru","Rossi, Vincenzo","Sun, Qixin","Ni, Zhongfu","Yao, Yingyin","HuiRu Peng"],"doi":"10.1105\/tpc.15.00691","first_seen_on":"2016-02-24T13:33:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-298X","1040-4651"],"issue":"3","journal":"Plant Cell","last_mentioned_on":1489753858,"links":["http:\/\/www.plantcell.org\/content\/early\/2016\/02\/23\/tpc.15.00691.abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26908760?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26908760","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4826005\/figure\/fig3\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.plantcell.org\/content\/early\/2016\/02\/23\/tpc.15.00691.full.pdf","pmid":"26908760","pubdate":"2016-02-26T15:58:39+00:00","publisher":"American Society of Plant Biologists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"629","subjects":["cellbiology","botany"],"title":"Genome-wide Mapping of Targets of Maize Histone Deacetylase HDA101 Reveals Its Function and Regulatory Mechanism during Seed Development","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.plantcell.org\/lookup\/doi\/10.1105\/tpc.15.00691","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomewide-mapping-targets-maize-histone-deacetylase-hda101-reveals-function-regulatory-mechanism-du"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.45,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":1538388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6829392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290042,"mean":10.785926086312,"rank":67711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":222021,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290042,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2561,"mean":5.92728984375,"rank":598,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":1960,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2561,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":10.875672727273,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
