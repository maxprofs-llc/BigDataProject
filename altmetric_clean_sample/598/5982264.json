Hypoxia leads to the inflammation and oxidative stress in endothelial cells, which results in the endothelial injury. The present study was designed to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of folic acid on hypoxia-induced injury in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Cell counting Kit was used to detect cell survival rate, and apoptotic cells were detected by Hoechst 33258 staining. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was measured using dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate staining. Western blot was used to determine the protein expressions of extracellular signal protein kinase 1\/2 (ERK1\/2) and phosphorylated ERK1\/2 (p-ERK1\/2), NOX4 subunit of NAPDH and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Folic acid significantly increased the cell survival rate and decreased the apoptosis of HUVECs treated with folic acid compared with hypoxia-treated HUVEC. Folic acid also decreased ROS level, while it increased the nitrite content in HUVECs. In addition, folic acid decreased protein expressions of NOX4 and p-ERK1\/2, while it increased the protein expression of eNOS in HUVECs. Furthermore, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), the antioxidant, had similar effect on the cell survival rate and the apoptosis. In addition, DPI (NOX4 inhibitor) and U0126 (ERK1\/2 inhibitor) rather than NAC decreased the protein expression of NOX4. NAC, DPI, and U0126 increased the protein expression of eNOS. Furthermore, U0126 rather than DPI and NAC decreased the protein expression of p-ERK1\/2. Taken together, the results suggested that hypoxia decreased the cell survival rate and induced apoptosis via ERK1\/2\/NOX4\/ROS pathway, which could be the target of folic acid in protecting the HUVECs from injury caused by hypoxia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e12","authors":["Fei Cheng","Jun Lan","Wenhao Xia","Chang Tu","Benfa Chen","Shicheng Li","Weibiao Pan","Cheng, Fei","Lan, Jun","Xia, Wenhao","Tu, Chang","Chen, Benfa","Li, Shicheng","Pan, Weibiao"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12013-016-0723-z","first_seen_on":"2016-02-24T04:47:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-0283"],"journal":"Cell Biochemistry and Biophysics","last_mentioned_on":1456586379,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs12013-016-0723-z","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26906511?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12013-016-0723-z.pdf","pmid":"26906511","pubdate":"2016-02-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Folic Acid Attenuates Vascular Endothelial Cell Injury Caused by Hypoxia via the Inhibition of ERK1\/2\/NOX4\/ROS Pathway","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/folic-acid-attenuates-vascular-endothelial-cell-injury-caused-hypoxia-via-inhibition-erk12nox4ros-pa-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7295661,"mean":6.3692208345751,"rank":3509471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":3600192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7295661,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283255,"mean":10.424430256942,"rank":140425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":131884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283255,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":578,"mean":1.0841455805893,"rank":105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":578,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.75,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BlackPhysicists\/statuses\/702290379253510144","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5982264],"posted_on":"2016-02-24T00:34:08+00:00","author":{"name":"BlackPhysicists","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/502208695854313472\/mupwPlOC_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"BlackPhysicists","tweeter_id":"46854930","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":16365},"tweet_id":"702290379253510144"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/703528037384478720","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5982264],"posted_on":"2016-02-27T10:32:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":407},"tweet_id":"703528037384478720"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ayuskloam2\/statuses\/703600390252662784","license":"gnip","rt":["hypoxiapapers"],"citation_ids":[5982264],"posted_on":"2016-02-27T15:19:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Amaya","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/794891263057207296\/5xttBsce_normal.jpg","description":"Estudiante de doctorado fisiolog\u00eda y biolog\u00eda molecular\/PhD student physiology and molecular biology","id_on_source":"ayuskloam2","tweeter_id":"292983372","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":89},"tweet_id":"703600390252662784"}]}}
