Exoenzyme S (ExoS), a Type III effector protein, ADP-ribosylates Rab5 GTPase and impair early phagocytic events in macrophage cells. In this current study, we tested the hypothesis that Rin1, a Ras effector protein and Rab5 guanine exchange factor (GEF), generates an intrinsic Rab5 activity cycle during phagocytosis of live P. aeruginosa thus allowing proper phagocytic killing. We found that Rab5 activity was attenuated at a very early time point (2.5 min) of the phagocytic process of live but not of heat inactivated P. aeruginosa. However, upon overexpressing Rin1 in macrophages, the Rab5 activity sustained for a prolonged time (~20 min) counteracting the negative effect during phagocytosis of live P. aeruginosa. Ras, also a substrate of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of ExoS, remained active during the early events of phagocytosis of live as well as heat inactivated P. aeruginosa. Further examinations revealed that Rin1:Vps9 domain (the Rab5 nucleotide catalytic domain) and Rin1:RA domain (the Ras association domain of Rin1) are both required for optimal Rin1 function. Finally, the time-based analysis of ADP-ribosylation status of Rab5 and Ras obtained from this study were consistent in the context of the regulation of 1) Rab5 activity by Rin1: Vps9 domain and 2) Ras interaction with Rin1 via the Rin1: RA domain. These observations highlight a novel crosstalk between of Rin1-Rab5 and Rin1-Ras complexes that will offset anti phagocytic effects of ExoS in macrophages.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d51","authors":["Mustafi, S","Barbieri, M A"],"doi":"10.1099\/jmm.0.000235","first_seen_on":"2016-02-24T17:22:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-5644"],"journal":"Journal of Medical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1456332968,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26902911?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26902911","pubdate":"2016-02-24T22:00:49+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Rin1 restores host phagocytosis activity during the invasion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rin1-restores-host-phagocytic-activity-during-invasion-pseudomonas-aeruginosa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7269211,"mean":6.3660833867746,"rank":3697201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2053615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7269211,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283156,"mean":10.419672518585,"rank":152591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":100929,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283156,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":822,"mean":2.5171303288672,"rank":424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":822,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.9103448275862,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pseudo_papers\/statuses\/702537506491764736","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5988558],"posted_on":"2016-02-24T16:56:08+00:00","author":{"name":"pseudomonaspapers","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=pseudomonas","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/570219565901029376\/j3RfXxUz_normal.jpeg","description":"PubMed search bot for pseudomonas.
