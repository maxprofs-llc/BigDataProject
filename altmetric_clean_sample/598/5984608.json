Each strategy was assessed at screening intervals of 1, 2, 3, or 5 years. A Markov model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of the 16 possible cervical cancer screening strategies, and this was evaluated from a societal perspective. The main outcome measures were average lifetime cost, incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).\nCompared with various strategies comprising younger starting age, discontinuation age, and longer screening intervals, strategies employing annual screening for cervical cancer starting at a target age of 30 years and above were the most cost-effective, with an ICER of 21,012.98 dollars per QALY gained (with a Korean threshold of 30,000,000 KRW or US$27,272).\nWe found that annual screening for cervical cancer beginning at a target age of 30 years and above is most cost-effective screening strategy. Considering the potential economic advantages, more intense screening policies for cervical cancer might be favorable among countries with high rates of cervical cancer and relatively low screening costs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b68","authors":["Ko, Min Jung","Kim, Jimin","Kim, Younhee","Lee, Yoon Jae","Hong, Sung Ran","Lee, Jae Kwan"],"first_seen_on":"2016-02-24T10:09:18+00:00","issns":["1513-7368"],"issue":"6","journal":"Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1456304280,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=25824757"],"pmid":"25824757","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Cost-effectiveness analysis of cervical cancer screening strategies based on the Papanicolaou smear test in Korea","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/costeffectiveness-analysis-cervical-cancer-screening-strategies-based-papanicolaou-smear-test-korea-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7269211,"mean":6.3660833867746,"rank":5483048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7269211,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283157,"mean":10.419444836062,"rank":198447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":45249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283157,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1355,"mean":2.180788774003,"rank":582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1355,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":1.6380952380952,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
