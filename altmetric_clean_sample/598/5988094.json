This study was to (i) investigate the hypocholesterolemic activity of lard functionalized with mushroom extracts (LF) including fungal \u03b2-glucans, water-soluble polysaccharides, or ergosterol and (ii) examine the LF influence on transcriptional mechanisms involved in cholesterol metabolism. mRNA levels of 17 cholesterol-related genes were evaluated in jejunum, cecum, and liver of high cholesterol-fed mice. The four tested LFs decreased plasma cholesterol by 22-42%, HDLc by 18-40%, and LDLc by 27-51%, and two of them increased mRNA levels of jejunal Npc1l1 and Abcg5 and hepatic Npc1l1. mRNA levels of other cholesterol-related genes were unchanged. These findings suggest that LF may have potential as a dietary supplement for counteracting diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and could be a source for the development of novel cholesterol-lowering functional foods. However, the cholesterol-lowering effect was unrelated to transcriptional changes, suggesting that post-transcriptional mechanisms could be involved.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006625","authors":["Caz, V\u00edctor","Gil-Ram\u00edrez, Alicia","Santamar\u00eda, M\u00f3nica","Tabernero, Mar\u00eda","Soler-Rivas, Cristina","Mart\u00edn-Hern\u00e1ndez, Roberto","Mar\u00edn, Francisco R","Reglero, Guillermo","Largo, Carlota","V\u00edctor Caz"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jafc.5b05490","first_seen_on":"2016-02-24T16:07:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5118","0021-8561"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Agricultural & Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1460640569,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26900983?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jafc.5b05490"],"pmid":"26900983","pubdate":"2016-02-24T22:01:36+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Plasma Cholesterol-Lowering Activity of Lard Functionalized with Mushroom Extracts Is Independent of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 Protein and ABC Sterol ...  - PubMed - NCBI","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plasma-cholesterollowering-activity-lard-functionalized-mushroom-extracts-independent-niemannpick-c1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7551260,"mean":6.5206857693492,"rank":3682769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3677392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7551260,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285106,"mean":10.502955255081,"rank":142433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":131841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285106,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5642,"mean":5.5106300301365,"rank":3178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":2334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5642,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":9.8365,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
