We investigated the role of alveolar epithelial SGLT1 activity on ASL glucose concentration and bacterial proliferation. Non-diabetic and diabetic rats were intranasally treated with saline, isoproterenol (to increase SGLT1 activity) or phlorizin (to decrease SGLT1 activity); 2\u2009hours later, glucose concentration and bacterial proliferation (methicillin-resistant Sthaphylococcus aureus, MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. aeruginosa) were analyzed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL); and alveolar SGLT1 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. BAL glucose concentration and bacterial proliferation increased in diabetic animals: isoproterenol stimulated SGLT1 migration to luminal membrane, and reduced (50%) the BAL glucose concentration; whereas phlorizin increased the BAL glucose concentration (100%). These regulations were accompanied by parallel changes of in vitro MRSA and P. aeruginosa proliferation in BAL (r\u2009=\u20090.9651 and r\u2009=\u20090.9613, respectively, Pearson correlation). The same regulations were observed in in vivo P. aeruginosa proliferation. In summary, the results indicate a relationship among SGLT1 activity, ASL glucose concentration and pulmonary bacterial proliferation. Besides, the study highlights that, in situations of pulmonary infection risk, such as in diabetic subjects, increased SGLT1 activity may prevent bacterial proliferation whereas decreased SGLT1 activity can exacerbate it.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Oliveira, Tales Lyra","Candeia-Medeiros, N\u00e1vylla","Cavalcante-Ara\u00fajo, Polliane M","Melo, Igor Santana","F\u00e1varo-P\u00edpi, Elaine","F\u00e1tima, Luciana Alves","Rocha, Ant\u00f4nio Augusto","Goulart, Luiz Ricardo","Machado, Ubiratan Fabres","Campos, Ruy R","Sabino-Silva, Robinson","Tales Lyra Oliveira","N\u00e1vylla Candeia-Medeiros","Polliane M.
