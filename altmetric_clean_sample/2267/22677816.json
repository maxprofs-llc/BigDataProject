In this work, we propose an effective and low-cost nano-texturing method for considerably reducing the reflectance of bulk Germanium. To do so, uniform V-shape pit arrays are produced by wet electroless chemical etching in a 3:1 volume ratio of highly-concentrated hydrochloridric and nitric acids or so-called aqua regia bath using immersion times ranging from 5 to 60 min. The resulting pit morphology, the crystalline structure of the surface and the changes in surface chemistry after nano-patterning are all investigated. Finally, broadband near-infrared reflectance measurements confirm a significant reduction using this simple wet etching protocol, while maintaining a crystalline, dioxide-free, and hydrogen-passivated surface. It is important to mention that reflectance could be further reduced using deeper pits. However, most optoelectronic applications such as photodetectors and solar cells require relatively shallow patterning of the Germanium to allow formation of a pn-junction close to the surface.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041bc","authors":["Ibtihel Chaabane","Debika Banerjee","Oualid Touayar","Sylvain Cloutier"],"doi":"10.3390\/ma10080854","first_seen_on":"2017-07-27T08:46:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1996-1944"],"issue":"8","journal":"Materials (1996-1944)","last_mentioned_on":1501140844,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/10\/8\/854"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/10\/8\/854\/pdf","pmid":"28773215","pubdate":"2017-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Shallow V-Shape Nanostructured Pit Arrays in Germanium Using Aqua Regia Electroless Chemical Etching","type":"article","volume":"10"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":6284111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1120215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171711,"mean":11.607357637878,"rank":121058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171711,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1142,"mean":0.95395617879053,"rank":518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1142,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":0.89403669724771,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Materials_mdpi\/statuses\/890475359447031808","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22677816],"posted_on":"2017-07-27T07:34:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Materials_MDPI","url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/journal\/materials","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/644063856210264064\/WVCB9lws_normal.png","description":"Materials (ISSN 1996-1944; CODEN: MATEG9) is an open access journal of materials science and engineering published monthly online by MDPI.","id_on_source":"Materials_mdpi","tweeter_id":"3579413300","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":322},"tweet_id":"890475359447031808"}]}}
