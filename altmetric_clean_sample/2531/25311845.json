There is currently no disease-modifying therapy available for these diseases. We screened 1,600 FDA-approved drugs for their efficacy to protect LUHMES cells from degeneration induced by wild-type \u03b1-synuclein and identified dipyridamole, a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, as top hit. Systematic analysis of other phosphodiesterase inhibitors identified a specific phosphodiesterase 1 inhibitor as most potent to rescue from \u03b1-synuclein toxicity. Protection was mediated by an increase of cGMP and associated with the reduction of a specific \u03b1-synuclein oligomeric species. RNA interference experiments confirmed PDE1A and to a smaller extent PDE1C as molecular targets accounting for the protective efficacy. PDE1 inhibition also rescued dopaminergic neurons from wild-type \u03b1-synuclein induced degeneration in the substantia nigra of mice. In conclusion, this work identifies inhibition of PDE1A in particular as promising target for neuroprotective treatment of synucleinopathies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Matthias H\u00f6llerhage","Claudia Moebius","Johannes Melms","Wei-Hua Chiu","Joachim N.
