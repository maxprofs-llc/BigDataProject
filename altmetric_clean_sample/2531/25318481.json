Formation of reduction product aurocyanide occurred through mono- and di-n-acetylcysteine-substituted intermediates. The product and intermediates were identified and monitored spectrophotometrically and by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. This study suggests successive substitution with n-acetylcysteine through trans effect. At equimolar concentrations of auricyanide and n-acetylcysteine, only mono-substituted mixed-ligand complex was formed. Substitution of the data obtained to various kinetic models suggested that the reaction orders are 0.6 in terms of n-acetylcysteine, 1.5 in terms of auricyanide, and 2 overall. The intermediates detected in this work may help to synthesize more effective and less toxic gold drugs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c68","authors":["Syed G. T. Kazimi","Mohammad S.
