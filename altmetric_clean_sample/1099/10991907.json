In response to these the fungus produces unique terpenoid and polyketide metabolites. Parts of the plants may be killed by the phytotoxin, botrydial enabling the fungus to feed on the dead cells. In this paper we describe the genetic and molecular basis of botrydial biosynthesis and the function of the five genes of the genome of B. cinerea which together constitute the botrydial biosynthetic gene cluster. Genes BcBOT3 and BcBOT4, encoding two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, were inactivated by homologous recombination and were shown to catalyse regio- and stereospecific hydroxylations, at the carbons C-10 and C-4 respectively, of the presilphiperfolan-8\u03b2-ol skeleton. The null mutants i.e. bcbot3\u0394 and bcbot4\u0394 accumulated key intermediates in the botrydial biosynthesis enabling the complete genetic and molecular basis of the botrydial biosynthetic pathway to be established. Furthermore, the bcbot4\u0394 mutant overproduced a significant number of polyketides, which included, in addition to known botcinins, botrylactones and cinbotolide A, two new botrylactones and two new cinbotolides, cinbotolides B and C.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006811","authors":["Javier Moraga"],"doi":"10.1021\/acschembio.6b00581","first_seen_on":"2016-09-01T21:01:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1554-8937","1554-8929"],"issue":"10","journal":"ACS Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1472763689,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acschembio.6b00581"],"pmid":"27529428","pubdate":"2016-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","biochemistry"],"title":"Genetic and molecular basis of botrydial biosynthesis.
