However, no sufficient studies have been conducted with Chinese adults. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of tooth wear and identify related indicators among adults aged 36 to 74 years in Wuhan City, P.R. China. A cross-sectional and analytic study was conducted with 720 participants, aged 35-49 yrs and 50-74 yrs, in 2014. Each age group included 360 participants, of which 50% were males and 50% were females. All participants completed a questionnaire before examination. Tooth wear was assessed using the modified Basic Erosive Wear Examination (BEWE) index. The data were analyzed using the chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of tooth wear was 67.5% and 100% in the 35-49 and 50-74 age groups, respectively. The prevalence of dentin exposure was 64.7% and 98.3%, respectively. A significantly higher prevalence of tooth wear and dentin exposure was found in the 50-74 yr group than in the 35-49 yr group (p < 0.05). Critical indicators of tooth wear and dentin exposure included high frequency of acidic drinks and foods consumption, low socio-economic status, and unilateral chewing. The frequency of changing toothbrushes and the habit of drinking water during meals were associated with tooth wear. In addition, the usage of hard-bristle toothbrushes and consuming vitamin C and aspirin were found to be linked with dentin exposure. In conclusion, the prevalence of tooth wear and dentin exposure observed in Chinese adults was high, and the results revealed an association between tooth wear and socio-behavioral risk indicators.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Zhao Wei","Yangge Du","Jing Zhang","Baojun Tai","Minquan Du","Han Jiang"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0162181","first_seen_on":"2016-09-01T17:49:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1473158167,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0162181","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0162181&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0162181.PDF","pmid":"27583435","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0162181","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Prevalence and Indicators of Tooth Wear among Chinese Adults","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-indicators-tooth-wear-among-chinese-adults"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":4442599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2320366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251986,"mean":12.500723074786,"rank":138885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":88170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251986,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115157,"mean":10.619580464761,"rank":66883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":36886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115157,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4347,"mean":9.921070409572,"rank":2694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":1251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4347,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
