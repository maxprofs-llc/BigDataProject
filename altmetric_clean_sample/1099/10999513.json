However, little is known about the function of miR-203 in osteosarcoma (OS).\nThe expression of miR-203 in OS tissues and cell lines were examined by qRT-PCR. The biological role of miR-20 in OS cell proliferation was examined in vitro and in vivo. The targets of miR-203 were identified by a luciferase reporter gene assay.\nmiR-203 was down regulated in OS tissues and cell lines; decreased miR-203 was associated with a poor overall survival in OS patients. Restoration of miR-203 expression reduced cell growth in vitro and suppressed tumorigenicity in vivo. In contrast, inhibition of miR-203 stimulated OS cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) was identified as a direct target of miR-203; overexpression of TBK1 partly reversed the suppressive effects of miR-203. Furthermore, TBK1 was found up-regulated and inversely correlated with miR-203 in OS tissues.\nTaken together, these findings suggest that miR-203 acts as a tumor suppressor via regulation of TBK1 expression in OS progression, and miR-203 may be a promising therapeutic target for OS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024cd","authors":["Liu, Shiping","Feng, Peng"],"doi":"10.1159\/000438556","endpage":"1966","first_seen_on":"2016-09-02T09:36:25+00:00","issns":["1421-9778","1015-8987"],"issue":"5","journal":"Cellular Physiology & Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1472808970,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26584294?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26584294","pubdate":"2015-11-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1956","subjects":["cellbiology","pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"MiR-203 Determines Poor Outcome and Suppresses Tumor Growth by Targeting TBK1 in Osteosarcoma","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir203-determines-poor-outcome-suppresses-tumor-growth-targeting-tbk1-osteosarcoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":7191616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251838,"mean":12.500565143326,"rank":211173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251838,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":980,"mean":2.6296322778345,"rank":577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":980,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.5677777777778,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
