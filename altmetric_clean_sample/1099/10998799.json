We investigated whether individual differences in the co-variance of \"implicit\" and \"explicit\" spider fear exist, and whether this covariation exerts an effect on spider fear-related outcomes. One hundred and thirty-two undergraduate students completed direct and indirect measures of spider fear\/avoidance, self-report questionnaires of psychopathology, an attentional bias task, and a proxy Behavioural Approach Task. TwoStep cluster analysis using implicit and explicit spider fear as criterion variables resulted in three clusters: (1) low explicit\/low implicit; (2) average explicit\/high implicit; and (3) high explicit\/low implicit. Clusters with higher explicit fear demonstrated greater disgust propensity and sensitivity and less willingness to approach a spider. No differences between clusters emerged on anticipatory approach anxiety or attentional bias. We discuss results in terms of dual-systems and cognitive-behavioural models of fear.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f6100017d5","authors":["Ouimet, Allison J","Bahl, Nancy","Radomsky, Adam S"],"doi":"10.1080\/02699931.2016.1223019","first_seen_on":"2016-09-02T09:13:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1464-0600"],"journal":"Cognition &amp; Emotion","last_mentioned_on":1472807579,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27552192"],"pmid":"27552192","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Thinking high but feeling low: An exploratory cluster analysis investigating how implicit and explicit spider fear co-vary.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thinking-high-feeling-low-exploratory-cluster-analysis-investigating-implicit-explicit-spider-fear-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":7191618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251838,"mean":12.500568518525,"rank":211174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251838,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":825,"mean":7.9446723300971,"rank":732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":825,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":5.4004,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
