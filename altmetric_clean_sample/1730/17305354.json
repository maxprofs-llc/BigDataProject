This is at least in part a result of immunosenescence; the age-dependent decrease in immunological competence that results in greater susceptibility to infections and reduced responses to vaccination. To improve protective immune responses in this age group, new vaccines strategies, such as the use of adjuvants, are needed. Here, we evaluated the mucosal vaccine adjuvant Endocine\u2122, formulated with split influenza antigen and administered intranasally in aged (20-month old) mice. Humoral immune responses were assessed and compared to unadjuvanted intranasal and subcutaneous vaccines. We show that formulation with Endocine\u2122 significantly enhances hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers, as well as serum IgG and mucosal IgA antibody titers, compared to both types of unadjuvanted vaccines. Thus, our results indicate that intranasal vaccination with Endocine\u2122 is a possible approach for the development of mucosal influenza vaccines for the elderly.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008a9","authors":["Tina Falkeborn","Jorma Hinkula","Marie Olliver","Alf Lindberg","Anna-Karin Maltais","Tina Falkeborn","Jorma Hinkula","Marie Olliver","Alf Lindberg","Anna-Karin Maltais"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12985-017-0698-4","first_seen_on":"2017-03-13T10:32:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1743-422X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Virology Journal","last_mentioned_on":1489401120,"links":["http:\/\/virologyj.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12985-017-0698-4"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/virologyj.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12985-017-0698-4?site=virologyj.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28253901","pubdate":"2017-03-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Virology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"44","title":"The intranasal adjuvant Endocine\u2122 enhances both systemic and mucosal immune responses in aged mice immunized with influenza antigen","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/virologyj.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12985-017-0698-4","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intranasal-adjuvant-endocine-enhances-both-systemic-mucosal-immune-responses-aged-mice-immunized-inf"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":6338053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1132112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242713,"mean":13.666747412571,"rank":175948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40845,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242713,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1682,"mean":3.4810910172516,"rank":1326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1682,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":2.1568275862069,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VirologyJ\/statuses\/841235388735856640","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17305354],"posted_on":"2017-03-13T10:32:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Virology Journal","url":"http:\/\/virologyj.biomedcentral.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2412502248\/49xz64c5b5p98ent0tkj_normal.png","description":"Virology Journal is an open access, peer reviewed journal that publishes research on all aspects of virology, edited by Linfa Wang.Most tweets by @DanaBerryBMC","id_on_source":"VirologyJ","tweeter_id":"705226320","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":4478},"tweet_id":"841235388735856640"}]}}
