While the dual role of TGF-\u03b2 is well described, the function of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) is unclear. In this study, we established the involvement of Smad6, a BMP-specific inhibitory Smad, in breast cancer cell invasion. We show that stable overexpression of Smad6 in breast cancer MCF10A M2 cells inhibits BMP signalling, thereby mitigating BMP6-induced suppression of mesenchymal marker expression. Using a zebrafish xenograft model, we demonstrate that overexpression of Smad6 potentiates invasion of MCF10A M2 cells and enhances the aggressiveness of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells in vivo, whereas a reversed phenotype is observed after Smad6 knockdown. Interestingly, BMP6 pre-treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells induced cluster formation at the invasive site in the zebrafish. BMP6 also stimulated cluster formation of MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured on Human Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HMEC)-1 in vitro. Electron microscopy illustrated an induction of cell-cell contact by BMP6. The clinical relevance of our findings is highlighted by a correlation of high Smad6 expression with poor distant metastasis free survival in ER-negative cancer patients. Collectively, our data strongly indicates the involvement of Smad6 and BMP signalling in breast cancer cell invasion in vivo.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["de Boeck, Miriam","Cui, Chao","Mulder, Aat A","Jost, Carolina R","Ikeno, Souichi","Ten Dijke, Peter"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep24968","first_seen_on":"2016-04-27T10:09:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1461751756,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27113436?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27113436","pubdate":"2016-04-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Transforming growth factor beta","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Cell invasion","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"24968","subjects":["science"],"title":"Smad6 determines BMP-regulated invasive behaviour of breast cancer cells in a zebrafish xenograft model","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/smad6-determines-bmpregulated-invasive-behaviour-breast-cancer-cells-zebrafish-xenograft-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7615205,"mean":6.556701012339,"rank":6592528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7615205,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267039,"mean":11.388028909743,"rank":223790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267039,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29652,"mean":14.882443155374,"rank":25360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29652,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2818,"mean":15.345863684771,"rank":2363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2818,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
