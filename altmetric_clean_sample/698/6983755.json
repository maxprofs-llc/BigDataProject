Although not as common as in K. pneumoniae, KPC is also found in Escherichia coli strains. Here, we genetically characterized 9 carbapenem-resistant E. coli strains isolated from six hospitals in the United States, and completely sequenced their blaKPC-harboring plasmids. The nine strains were isolated from different geographical locations and belonged to 8 different E. coli sequence types. Seven blaKPC-harboring plasmids belonged to four different known incompatibility groups (IncN, FIA, FIIK2, FIIK1) and ranged in size from \u223c16-kb to \u223c241-kb. In this analysis, we also identified two plasmids that have novel replicons; i) pBK28610 is similar to p34978-3 with an insertion of Tn4401b, and ii) pBK31611 which does not have an apparent homologue in the GenBank database. Moreover, we report the emergence of pKP048-like plasmid, pBK34397, in E. coli in the US. Meanwhile, we also found examples of inter-species spread of blaKPC plasmids as pBK34592 is identical as pBK30683 isolated from K. pneumoniae In addition, we discovered examples of acquisition (pBK32602 acquired \u223c46kb fragment encoding a novel replication gene along with Tn4401b and other resistance genes) and\/or loss (pKpQIL-Ec has 14.5kb deletion compared to pKpQIL-10 and pBK33689) of DNA demonstrating the plasticity of these plasmids and their rapid evolution in the clinic. Overall, our study shows that the spread of blaKPC-producing E. coli is largely due to horizontal transfer of blaKPC-harboring plasmids and related mobile elements into diverse genetic backgrounds.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a6a","authors":["Chavda, Kalyan D","Chen, Liang","Jacobs, Michael R","Bonomo, Robert A","Kreiswirth, Barry N","Kalyan D.
