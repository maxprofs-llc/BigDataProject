These ligands include (i) amino acids and small peptides, (ii) nucleic acid constituents (excluding quadruplexes and other oligonucleotides), (iii) simple carbohydrates, and (iv) naturally occurring antibiotic ionophores. For some representative complexes of these ligands, some details on the environment of the metal coordination and structural characteristics are described.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cca9","authors":["Katsuyuki Aoki","Kazutaka Murayama","Ning-Hai Hu"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-3-319-21756-7_3","first_seen_on":"2016-04-27T09:19:47+00:00","issns":["1559-0836"],"journal":"Metal ions in life sciences","last_mentioned_on":1461747948,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/978-3-319-21756-7_3"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2F978-3-319-21756-7_3.pdf","pmid":"26860299","pubdate":"2016-04-27T20:16:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"}],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"The Alkali Metal Ions: Their Role for Life","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/solid-state-structures-alkali-metal-ion-complexes-formed-lowmolecularweight-ligands-biological-relev"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7615205,"mean":6.556701012339,"rank":1846713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4754183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7615205,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267039,"mean":11.388037148271,"rank":86070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":177350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267039,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":4.3657142857143,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":3,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Ionophore","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=717374770#altmetric_citation_071f1c19-d267-4b52-8724-48bd4d0832c6","license":"public","citation_ids":[6982464],"posted_on":"2016-04-27T09:05:48+00:00","summary":"An ionophore is a chemical species that reversibly binds ions.
