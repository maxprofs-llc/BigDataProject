However, the insertion of an additional port is required in a subset of cases.\nWe retrospectively analyzed 308 SILC procedures in patients with benign gallbladder diseases, except acute cholecystitis, to identify preoperative factors predicting the need for an additional port.\nSILC was completed with a single incision in 272 patients (88%); the insertion of at least one additional port was required in 36 patients (12%). The additional port requirement was associated with a longer operative time (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), greater intraoperative blood loss (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), and longer postoperative hospital stay (P\u2009=\u20090.0002). Multivariate analysis revealed male gender (odds ratio: 2.57, P\u2009=\u20090.0170), prior history of upper abdominal surgery (odds ratio: 5.53, P\u2009=\u20090.0132), and a higher preoperative white blood cell count (odds ratio: 3.62, P\u2009=\u20090.0244) to be independent factors associated with the requirement for an additional port.\nOur results suggest that gender, prior history of upper abdominal surgery, and white blood cell count can predict the likelihood of requiring an additional port in SILC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b5a","authors":["Sato, Norihiro","Yabuki, Kei","Kudo, Yuzan","Koga, Atsuhiro","Kohi, Shiro","Tamura, Toshihisa","Shibao, Kazunori","Hirata, Keiji"],"doi":"10.1111\/ases.12286","first_seen_on":"2016-04-27T10:08:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1758-5910"],"journal":"Asian Journal of Endoscopic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1461751692,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27113627?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27113627","pubdate":"2016-04-26T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["generalsurgery","diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Preoperative factors predicting the need for additional ports during single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preoperative-factors-predicting-need-additional-ports-during-singleincision-laparoscopic-cholecystec"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7615205,"mean":6.556701012339,"rank":6592525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7615205,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267039,"mean":11.388029284221,"rank":223790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267039,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":0.58521126760563,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.55,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/725265282449580032","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6983403],"posted_on":"2016-04-27T10:08:12+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"725265282449580032"}]}}
