Diabetes is quickly becoming one of the leading causes of death. Diabetes is a genetic disease; however, the environment plays critical roles in its development and progression. Epigenetic changes often translate environmental stimuli to changes in gene expression. Changes in epigenetic marks and differential regulation of epigenetic modulators have been observed in different models of diabetes and its associated complications. In this minireview, we will focus DNA methylation, Histone acetylation and methylation and their roles in the pathogenesis of diabetes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031ac","authors":["Al-Haddad, Rami","Karnib, Nabil","Assaad, Rawad Abi","Bilen, Yara","Emmanuel, Nancy","Ghanem, Anthony","Younes, Joe","Zibara, Victor","Stephan, Joseph S","Sleiman, Sama F"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neulet.2016.04.046","first_seen_on":"2016-04-27T09:28:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03043940","1872-7972"],"journal":"Neuroscience Letters","last_mentioned_on":1462100110,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0304394016302671","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27130819?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27130819?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27130819","pubdate":"2016-05-01T10:18:50+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Epigenetic Changes in Diabetes ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epigenetic-changes-diabetes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7632130,"mean":6.5668397124796,"rank":5501904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1858318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7632130,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267173,"mean":11.388668939859,"rank":171735,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":80028,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267173,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2964,"mean":3.311390482619,"rank":2018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":868,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2964,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147,"mean":3.074698630137,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
