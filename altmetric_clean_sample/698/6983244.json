Some of the affected patients harbor too few copies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in their eggs at the time of fertilization, which results in developmental failure.\nIn the last 3-5 years, there has been a drive to overcome mtDNA deficiency through mitochondrial supplementation protocols using autologous populations of mitochondrial DNA so as not to perturb the offspring's genetic identity or mediate a series of side-effects because of the mixing of two distinct populations of mitochondrial DNA. It is evident that there is strict regulation of mitochondrial DNA copy number from the primordial germ cell through to the time when tissues are specified during organogenesis. Supplementation of oocytes can give rise to better quality embryos, enhanced blastocyst rates, and ongoing pregnancies. It utilizes a key mitochondrial DNA replication event that takes place shortly after fertilization to stabilize the embryonic genome.\nThese findings provide a rationale for undertaking mitochondrial supplementation and propose a mechanism to explain why the process can enhance embryo development. They also take the approach a step closer to clinical practice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005864","authors":["St John, Justin C","Tsai, Te-Sha","Cagnone, Gael L M","St John, Justin C.","Cagnone, Gael L.M."],"doi":"10.1097\/gco.0000000000000265","endpage":"216","first_seen_on":"2016-04-27T10:04:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-656X","1040-872X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology","last_mentioned_on":1462661382,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27115750?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-obgyn\/Abstract\/2016\/06000\/Mitochondrial_DNA_supplementation_as_an_enhancer.13.aspx"],"pmid":"27115750","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"211","subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Mitochondrial DNA supplementation as an enhancer of female reproductive capacity","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-obgyn\/Fulltext\/2016\/06000\/Mitochondrial_DNA_supplementation_as_an_enhancer.13.aspx","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mitochondrial-dna-supplementation-enhancer-female-reproductive-capacity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7662843,"mean":6.5825569912527,"rank":3511390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3978547,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7662843,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267448,"mean":11.390591384461,"rank":122052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":136624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267448,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":487,"mean":2.3416995884774,"rank":206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":487,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.1092592592593,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Brianxbio\/statuses\/725264149626810372","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6983244],"posted_on":"2016-04-27T10:03:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Brian Ho","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"Brianxbio","tweeter_id":"215282928","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":54},"tweet_id":"725264149626810372"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CO_Obs_Gyne\/statuses\/729080795898355712","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6983244],"posted_on":"2016-05-07T22:49:42+00:00","author":{"name":"CO Obs & Gyne","url":"http:\/\/www.co-obgyn.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1706241435\/GCO_square_cover_normal.jpg","description":"Provides powerful perspectives on the most important advances in published literature, delivering expert assessments of developments from the previous year.","id_on_source":"CO_Obs_Gyne","tweeter_id":"368282237","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":173},"tweet_id":"729080795898355712"}]}}
