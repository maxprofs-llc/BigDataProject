Control mice were not sensitized but were fed gliadin-free rice cereal. Experimental groups consisted of gliadin-sensitized and gliadin-challenged mice; nonsensitized mice with cerulein hyperstimulation; and gliadin-sensitized and gliadin-challenged mice with cerulein hyperstimulation.\nGliadinsensitized and gliadin-challenged mice with cerulein hyperstimulation showed significant inflammatory cell infiltrates, fibrosis and acinar atrophy compared with the control mice and the other experimental groups. The immunohistochemical analysis showed greater IgG1-positive plasma cells in the inflammatory infiltrates of gliadin-sensitized and gliadinchallenged mice with cerulein hyperstimulation compared with the control mice and the other experimental groups. Gliadin-sensitized and gliadin-challenged mice with cerulein hyperstimulation or gliadin-sensitized and gliadin-challenged mice showed IgG1-stained inflammatory cell infiltrates in the extrapancreatic organs, including the bile ducts, salivary glands, kidneys, and lungs.\nGliadin-sensitization and cerulein hyperstimulation of gluten-sensitive HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice resulted in pancreatitis and extrapancreatic inflammation. This animal model suggests that chronic gliadin ingestion in a susceptible individual with the HLA-DQ8 molecule may be associated with pancreatitis and extrapancreatic inflammation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc21","authors":["Moon, Sung-Hoon","Kim, Jihun","Kim, Mi-Young","Park, Do Hyun","Song, Tae Jun","Kim, Sun A","Lee, Sang Soo","Seo, Dong Wan","Lee, Sung Koo","Kim, Myung-Hwan"],"doi":"10.5009\/gnl15484","first_seen_on":"2016-04-27T12:02:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2005-1212","1976-2283"],"journal":"Gut and Liver","last_mentioned_on":1461758497,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27114422?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27114422","pubdate":"2016-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Sensitization to and Challenge with Gliadin Induce Pancreatitis and Extrapancreatic Inflammation in HLA-DQ8 Mice: An Animal Model of Type 1 Autoimmune Pancreatitis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sensitization-challenge-gliadin-induce-pancreatitis-extrapancreatic-inflammation-hladq8-mice-animal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7615205,"mean":6.556701012339,"rank":5761868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1022699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7615205,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267039,"mean":11.387989402257,"rank":187139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267039,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167,"mean":2.2828915662651,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.4863636363636,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
