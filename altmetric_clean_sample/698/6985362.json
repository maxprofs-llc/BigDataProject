A new approach introducing concept of sound doses cc @Chris_Manno"],"citation":{"abstract":"The time dependency for subjective responses to noise has been a controversial question over many years. For durations of up to 10 minutes, the discomfort produced by three levels of noise (i.e., 60, 70 and 80 dBA) was investigated in this experimental study to determine the relation of discomfort to the time duration of noise. The rate of increase in discomfort with increasing duration was 1.5 dB per doubling of exposure duration, whereas it is currently assumed to be 3 dB per doubling of exposure duration. The sound dose level (SDL) was proposed to predict the discomfort caused by noise of long duration. The combination of SDL and vibration dose value (VDV) provided more consistent estimates of the equivalence comfort contours between noise and vibration over durations from 2 to 32 seconds than the combination of sound exposure level and VDV or that of sound pressure level and r.m.s. acceleration. Practitioner summary The discomfort produced by noise of long duration can be well predicted from a new definition of sound dose level, where the discomfort increases at 1.5 dB per doubling of exposure duration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001232","authors":["Yu Huang","Huang, Yu","Jiang, Weikang"],"doi":"10.1080\/00140139.2016.1170890","endpage":"8","first_seen_on":"2016-04-27T11:50:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1366-5847","0014-0139"],"journal":"Ergonomics","last_mentioned_on":1462545309,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/00140139.2016.1170890?utm_content=buffer3a94c&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/00140139.2016.1170890"],"pmid":"27016173","pubdate":"2016-04-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Design Practice And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"The effect of exposure duration on the subjective discomfort of aircraft cabin noise","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-exposure-duration-subjective-discomfort-aircraft-cabin-noise"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7659635,"mean":6.5812991774756,"rank":3314260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4259178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7659635,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267421,"mean":11.390643871064,"rank":111716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":151743,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267421,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1195,"mean":4.3721206030151,"rank":760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1195,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":2.9377049180328,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
