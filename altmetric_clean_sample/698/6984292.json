Each group were either sacrificed at 6 weeks (early) or 6 months (late). Arterial liver perfusion was studied in vivo using CT, and histopathological changes were noted. Liver mRNA levels were quantified by RT-QPCR for markers of inflammation (Il10, Tnfa), proliferation (Il6st, Mki67, Hgf, Hnf4a), angiogenesis: (Vegfa, Vegfr 1, 2 and 3; Pgf), oxidative stress (Nos2, and 3, Hif1a), and fibrosis (Tgfb). PCS and PVL were compared to the S group.\nPeriportal fibrosis and arterial proliferation was observed in late PCS and PVL groups. CT imaging demonstrated increased arterial liver perfusion in the PCS group. RT-QPCR showed increased inflammatory markers in PCS and PVL early groups. Tnfa and Il10 were increased in PCS and PVL late groups respectively. All proliferative markers increased in the PCS, and Hnf4a in the PVL early groups. Mki67 and Hnf4a were increased in the PCS late group. Nos3 was increased in the early and late PCS groups, and Hif1a was decreased in the PVL groups. Markers of angiogenesis were all increased in the early PCS group, and Vegfr3 and Pgf in the late PCS group. Only Vegfr3 was increased in the PVL groups. Tgf was increased in the PCS groups.\nPortal deprivation in rats induces a sustained increase in intrahepatic markers of inflammation, angiogenesis, proliferation, and fibrosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Gu\u00e9rin, Florent","Wagner, Mathilde","Lin\u00e9, Antoine","Zappa, Magaly","Fasseu, Magali","Paradis, Val\u00e9rie","Vilgrain, Val\u00e9rie","Van Beers, Bernard E","Legagneux, Josette","Moreau, Richard","Lett\u00e9ron, Philippe"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0125493","first_seen_on":"2016-04-27T10:36:26+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1461753368,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26020934?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26020934","pubdate":"2015-05-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0125493","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Hepatic Proliferation and Angiogenesis Markers Are Increased after Portal Deprivation in Rats: A Study of Molecular, Histological and Radiological Changes","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hepatic-proliferation-angiogenesis-markers-increased-after-portal-deprivation-rats-study-molecular-h"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7615205,"mean":6.556701012339,"rank":6592538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7615205,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267040,"mean":11.387975217103,"rank":223790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267040,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108430,"mean":10.203365630966,"rank":91503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108430,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5043,"mean":13.018290757636,"rank":4467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5043,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
