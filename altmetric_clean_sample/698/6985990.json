This brief report examines the removal of head guards in 2 different ways. The first was to examine the stoppages due to blows to the head by comparing World Series Boxing (WSB), without head guards, to other AIBA competitions with head guards. Secondly, we examined the last 3 world championships: 2009 and 2011 (with head guards) and 2013 (without head guards).\nWorld Series Boxing and AIBA world championship boxing.\nBoxers from WSB and AIBA world championships.\nThe information was recorded by ringside medical physicians.\nStoppages per 10\u2009000 rounds; stoppages per 1000 hours.\nBoth studies show that the number of stoppages due to head blows was significantly decreased without head guards. The studies also showed that there was a notable increase in cuts.\nRemoving head guards may reduce the already small risk of acute brain injury in amateur boxing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002560","authors":["Loosemore, Michael P.","Butler, Charles F.","Khadri, Abdelhamid","McDonagh, David","Patel, Vimal A.","Bailes, Julian E.","Loosemore, Michael P","Butler, Charles F","Patel, Vimal A","Bailes, Julian E"],"doi":"10.1097\/jsm.0000000000000322","endpage":"88","first_seen_on":"2016-04-27T12:31:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1050-642X","1536-3724"],"issue":"1","journal":"Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1487697803,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/cjsportsmed\/9000\/00000\/Use_of_Head_Guards_in_AIBA_Boxing_Tournaments_A.99567.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cjsportsmed\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Use_of_Head_Guards_in_AIBA_Boxing_Tournaments_A.99567.aspx?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cjsportsmed\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Use_of_Head_Guards_in_AIBA_Boxing_Tournaments_A.99567.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27116592","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/JSM.0000000000000322","http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/cjsportsmed\/_layouts\/15\/oaks.journals.mobile\/articleviewer.aspx?year=9000&issue=00000&article=99567","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cjsportsmed\/Abstract\/2017\/01000\/Use_of_Head_Guards_in_AIBA_Boxing_Tournaments_A.13.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cjsportsmed\/Fulltext\/2017\/01000\/Use_of_Head_Guards_in_AIBA_Boxing_Tournaments_A.13.aspx?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cjsportsmed\/Pages\/articleviewer.aspx?year=2017&issue=01000&article=00013&type=Fulltext","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cjsportsmed\/Fulltext\/2017\/01000\/Use_of_Head_Guards_in_AIBA_Boxing_Tournaments_A.13.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/cjsportsmed\/9000\/00000\/Use_of_Head_Guards_in_AIBA_Boxing_Tournaments_A.99567.pdf","pmid":"27116592","pubdate":"2016-04-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Use of Head Guards in AIBA Boxing Tournaments\u2014A Cross-Sectional Observational Study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cjsportsmed\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Use_of_Head_Guards_in_AIBA_Boxing_Tournaments_A.99567.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/head-guards-aiba-boxing-tournamentsa-crosssectional-observational-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":43.664,"score_history":{"1y":11.28,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":43.664},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":208201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8042431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271612,"mean":11.552037163443,"rank":12663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":258949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271612,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1144,"mean":11.533312335958,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":1091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1144,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":32.123571428571,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
