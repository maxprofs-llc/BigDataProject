Pulmonary haemorrhage from ruptured pulmonary artery aneurysms (PAA) in this condition carries a high mortality but treatment has largely been empiric with use of glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide. Tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) was recently recognised as a mediator in the pathogenesis of BD inflammatory lesions. TNF\u03b1 inhibitors have been shown in various case reports\/series to have beneficial effects in uveoretinitis, entero-Beh\u00e7et's, neuro-Beh\u00e7et's and BD arthritis. We describe the efficacy and tolerability of infliximab in 2 patients with Beh\u00e7et's disease complicated by pulmonary vasculitis admitted to our unit during the years 2004-2015, and discuss the previously published data in this area.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000237e","authors":["Chan, Estee","Sangle, Shirish R","Coghlan, J Gerry","D'Cruz, David D","Estee Chan","Shirish R.
