These ways of making sense of AQP policy were associated with dissatisfaction with market-based health reforms.\nAQP policy is poorly understood. Clinicians and managers perceive AQP as synonymous with competition and privatisation. From the perspective of clinicians providing MSK services, AQP, and related health policy reforms, tend, paradoxically, to drive down quality standards, supporting reconfiguration of services in which the complex, holistic nature of specialised MSK care may become marginalised by policy concerns about efficiency and cost. Our analysis indicates that the potential of AQP policy to increase quality of care is, at best, equivocal, and that any consideration of how AQP impacts on practice can only be understood by reference to a wider range of health policy reforms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Jackie Walumbe","Deborah Swinglehurst","Sara Shaw"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2015-009789","first_seen_on":"2016-04-03T06:38:52+00:00","issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"2","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1459678114,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/2\/e009789.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/2\/e009789.full.pdf","pmid":"26908521","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","startpage":"e009789","title":"Any qualified provider: a qualitative case study of one community NHS Trust's response","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/qualified-provider-qualitative-case-study-one-community-nhs-trusts-response"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7483631,"mean":6.488280441707,"rank":3381755,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4072206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7483631,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272789,"mean":11.132993702069,"rank":122830,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":148146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272789,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5212,"mean":16.868383803493,"rank":3411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5212,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":367,"mean":13.691885245902,"rank":246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":367,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
