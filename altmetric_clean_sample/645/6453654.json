However, the association between UEB and weight gain is uncertain.\nProspective cohort with 1,638 individuals aged 18-60 years was recruited in 2008-2010. UEB assessed at baseline were: not planning how much to eat, consuming pre-cooked\/canned food, buying snacks, eating in fast-food restaurants, not choosing low-calorie foods, not removing visible fat from meat or skin from chicken, and eating while watching TV or seating on a sofa. Participants were followed up through 2012 to assess weight change.\nCompared to reporting 0-2 UEB, the multivariate odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for gaining \u22653 kg were 0.97 (0.74-1.28) for 3-4 UEB and 1.61 (1.09-2.39) for \u22655 UEB, P-trend\u2009=\u20090.07. Results were similar for gaining \u22655 kg. The three UEB with the strongest associations with weight gain were: 1) not planning the amount of food to eat, 2) eating at fast-food restaurants, and 3) eating while watching TV; compared to having none of these three behaviors, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for gaining \u22653 kg was 1.54 (0.77-3.08) for 1 UEB, 1.70 (0.85-3.37) for 2 UEB, and 2.75 (1.28-5.90) for 3 UEB, P-trend\u2009=\u20090.007. Similar results were obtained for gaining \u22655 kg.\nSeveral UEB are associated with weight gain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000834f","authors":["Le\u00f3n\u2010Mu\u00f1oz, Luz M.","Garc\u00eda\u2010Esquinas, Esther","Soler\u2010Vila, Hosanna","Guallar\u2010Castill\u00f3n, Pilar","Banegas, Jos\u00e9 R.","Rodr\u00edguez\u2010Artalejo, Fernando","Le\u00f3n-Mu\u00f1oz, Luz M","Garc\u00eda-Esquinas, Esther","Soler-Vila, Hosanna","Guallar-Castill\u00f3n, Pilar","Banegas, Jos\u00e9 R","Rodr\u00edguez-Artalejo, Fernando"],"doi":"10.1002\/oby.21477","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-04-03T13:13:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1930-739X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Obesity","last_mentioned_on":1463310063,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/oby.21477\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27030406\/","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/oby.21477\/abstract?campaign=woletoc","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/oby.21477\/abstract?utm_content=31454434&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/oby.21477\/abstract?utm_content=27053401&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/oby.21477\/abstract?utm_content=31454769&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1002\/oby.21477","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/oby.21477\/abstract?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/oby.21477\/pdf","pmid":"27030406","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["metabolism","physiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Unhealthy eating behaviors and weight gain: A prospective study in young and middle-age adults","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unhealthy-eating-behaviors-weight-gain-prospective-study-young-middleage-adults"},"altmetric_score":{"score":56.48,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":56.48},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7700406,"mean":6.6097173252523,"rank":140270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7560174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7700406,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275131,"mean":11.159422331261,"rank":10075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":265056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275131,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2322,"mean":20.436444635933,"rank":148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":2174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2322,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":81.669038961039,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":5,"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
