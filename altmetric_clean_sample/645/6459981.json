The classical electrocardiographic pattern of LMCA disease includes ST elevation (STE) in lead aVR in the presence of extensive ST depression (most prominent in leads I, II, and V4-6) with the STE in aVR\u2265V1. Patients with these findings may potentially require early coronary angiography and coronary bypass surgery; therefore selected patients with these findings on exercise testing might benefit from more urgent or expedited angiography.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9143cf058f61000cdac","authors":["Fatih Sen","Ozcan Ozeke","Ozgur Kirbas","Cengiz Burak","Habibe Kafes","Bahar Tekin Tak","Umran Ozdamar","Kadir Ocak","Serkan Topaloglu","Dursun Aras"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ihj.2016.03.025","first_seen_on":"2016-04-04T05:58:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00194832","0019-4832"],"journal":"Indian heart journal","last_mentioned_on":1459686742,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0019483216300049&_version=1&md5=c26af77c82b9026bbb1e38d6308e4137"],"pmid":"27751297","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Classical electrocardiographic clues for left main coronary artery disease","type":"article","volume":"68 Suppl 2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/classical-electrocardiographic-clues-left-main-coronary-artery-disease-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7483631,"mean":6.488280441707,"rank":6481831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7483631,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272072,"mean":11.158535845422,"rank":230010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272072,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261,"mean":2.1154230769231,"rank":191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":2.3970588235294,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/716604254643859456","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6459981],"posted_on":"2016-04-03T12:32:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":980},"tweet_id":"716604254643859456"}]}}
