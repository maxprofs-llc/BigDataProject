Therefore, olive oil may be a good alternative to improve the healing of these chronic lesions due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.\nThis study investigated the effect of olive oil administration on wound healing of pressure ulcers in mice.\nMale Swiss mice were daily treated with olive oil or water until euthanasia. One day after the beginning of treatment, two cycles of ischemia-reperfusion by external application of two magnetic plates were performed in skin to induced pressure ulcer formation.\nThe olive oil administration accelerated ROS and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and reduced oxidative damage in proteins and lipids when compared to water group. The inflammatory cell infiltration, gene tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) expression and protein neutrophil elastase expression were reduced by olive oil administration when compared to water group. The re-epithelialization and blood vessel number were higher in the olive oil group than in the water group. The olive oil administration accelerated protein expression of TNF-\u03b1, active transforming growth factor-\u03b21 and vascular endothelial growth factor-A when compared to water group. The collagen deposition, myofibroblastic differentiation and wound contraction were accelerated by olive oil administration when compared to water group.\nOlive oil administration improves cutaneous wound healing of pressure ulcers in mice through the acceleration of the ROS and NO synthesis, which reduces oxidative damage and inflammation and promotes dermal reconstruction and wound closure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d4f","authors":["Aline Donato-Trancoso","Andr\u00e9a Monte-Alto-Costa","Bruna Romana-Souza","Donato-Trancoso, Aline","Monte-Alto-Costa, Andr\u00e9a","Romana-Souza, Bruna"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jdermsci.2016.03.012","endpage":"69","first_seen_on":"2016-04-04T05:56:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09231811","1873-569X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Dermatological Science","last_mentioned_on":1472692708,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0923181116300378&_version=1&md5=4be39497da395ea277cde0e45203e5da","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27091748?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27091748","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.jdsjournal.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0923181116300378?cc%253Dy%2526sf33591360%253D1&rc=0&code=desc-site","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0923181116300378?cc%3Dy%26sf33591360%3D1","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.jdsjournal.com\/article\/S0923-1811(16)30037-8\/abstract?cc%3Dy%26sf33591360%3D1&rc=0&code=desc-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jdsjournal.com\/article\/S0923181116300378\/pdf","pmid":"27091748","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"60","subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Olive oil-induced reduction of oxidative damage and inflammation promotes wound healing of pressure ulcers in mice","type":"article","volume":"83","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/olive-oilinduced-reduction-oxidative-damage-inflammation-promotes-wound-healing-pressure-ulcers-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":527504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7785665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278400,"mean":11.386354218226,"rank":26764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":251593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278400,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":456,"mean":3.1767076923077,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":456,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":3.6534117647059,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
