SOD-based ROS scavenging system constitutes the frontline defense against intra- and extracellular ROS, but the roles of SODs in the important cereal pathogen Fusarium graminearum are not very clear. There are five SOD genes in F. graminearum genome, encoding cytoplasmic Cu-Zn SOD1 and MnSOD3, mitochondrial MnSOD2 and FeSOD4, and extracellular CuSOD5. Previous studies reported that the expression of SOD1 increased during infection of wheat coleoptiles and florets. In this work we showed that the recombinant SOD1 protein had the superoxide dismutase activity in vitro, and that the SOD1-mRFP fusion protein localized in the cytoplasm of F. graminearum. The \u0394sod1 mutants had slightly reduced hyphal growth and markedly increased sensitivity to the intracellular ROS generator menadione. The conidial germination under extracellular oxidative stress was significantly delayed in the mutants. Wheat floret infection assay showed that the \u0394sod1 mutants had a reduced pathogenicity. Furthermore, the \u0394sod1 mutants had a significant reduction in production of deoxynivalenol mycotoxin. Our results indicate that the cytoplasmic Cu-Zn SOD1 affects fungal growth probably depending on detoxification of intracellular superoxide radicals, and that SOD1-mediated deoxynivalenol production contributes to the virulence of F. graminearum in wheat head infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002922","authors":["Yao, Sheng-Hua","Guo, Yan","Wang, Yan-Zhang","Zhang, Dong","Xu, Ling","Tang, Wei-Hua","Sheng-Hua Yao","Yan Guo","Yan-Zhang Wang","Dong Zhang","Ling Xu","Wei-Hua Tang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fgb.2016.03.006","endpage":"42","first_seen_on":"2016-04-03T12:59:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-0937","10871845"],"journal":"Fungal Genetics & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1505816647,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27037138?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27037138?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27037138","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"32","subjects":["microbiology","genetics"],"title":"A cytoplasmic Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase SOD1 contributes to hyphal growth and virulence of Fusarium graminearum","type":"article","volume":"91","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cytoplasmic-cuzn-superoxide-dismutase-sod1-contributes-hyphal-growth-virulence-fusarium-graminearum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":6098133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2035443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279806,"mean":11.402387398366,"rank":180312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":82883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279806,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":524,"mean":3.1473116634799,"rank":344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":524,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.234375,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
