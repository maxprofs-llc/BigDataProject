We studied Mcat nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization, AOM frequency and mucosal antibody responses to four vaccine candidate Mcat proteins: outer membrane protein (OMP) CD, oligopeptide permease (Opp) A, hemagglutinin (Hag), and Pilin A clade 2 (PilA2) from stringently defined otitis prone (sOP) children, who experience the greatest burden of disease, compared to non-otitis prone (NOP) children. sOP children had higher NP colonization of Mcat (30 vs. 22%, P\u2009=\u20090.0003) and Mcat-caused AOM rates (49 vs. 24%, P\u2009<\u20090.0001) than NOP children. Natural acquisition of mucosal antibodies to Mcat proteins OMP CD (IgG, P\u2009<\u20090.0001), OppA (IgG, P\u2009=\u20090.018), Hag (IgG and IgA, both P\u2009<\u20090.0001), and PilA2 (IgA, P\u2009<\u20090.0001) was lower in sOP than NOP children. Higher levels of mucosal IgG to Hag (P\u2009=\u20090.039) and PilA2 (P\u2009=\u20090.0076), and IgA to OMP CD (P\u2009=\u20090.010), OppA (P\u2009=\u20090.030), and PilA2 (P\u2009=\u20090.043) were associated with lower carriage of Mcat in NOP but not sOP children. Higher levels of mucosal IgG to OMP CD (P\u2009=\u20090.0070) and Hag (P\u2009=\u20090.0003), and IgA to Hag (P\u2009=\u20090.0067) at asymptomatic colonization than those at onset of AOM were associated with significantly lower rate of Mcat NP colonization progressing to AOM in NOP compared to sOP children (3 vs. 26%, P\u2009<\u20090.0001). In conclusion, sOP children had a diminished mucosal antibody response to Mcat proteins, which was associated with higher frequencies of asymptomatic NP colonization and NP colonization progressing to Mcat-caused AOM. Enhancing Mcat antigen-specific mucosal immune responses to levels higher than achieved by natural exposure will be necessary to prevent AOM in sOP children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90c3cf058f61000cb02","authors":["Dabin Ren","Timothy F.
