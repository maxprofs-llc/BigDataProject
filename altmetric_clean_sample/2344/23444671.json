Gut-derived endotoxin plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of NASH. Salvia-Nelumbinis naturalis (SNN), a formula of Traditional Chinese Medicine, has been identified to be effective for NASH, but the mechanisms were not thoroughly explored. In the present study, a NASH model was generated using C57BL\/6 mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) supplemented periodically with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 12 weeks. Mice fed HFD alone (without DSS) or chow diet were used as controls. The NASH mice were given the SNN extracts in the following 4 weeks, while control mice were provided with saline. Mice fed HFD developed steatosis, and DSS supplementation resulted in NASH. The SNN extracts significantly improved metabolic disorders including obesity, dyslipidemia, and liver steatosis and reduced hepatic inflammation, circulating tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels. The beneficial effect of the SNN extracts was associated with restoration of intestinal conditions (microbiota, integrity of intestinal barrier) and inhibition of TLR4\/NF-\u03baB activation. These results suggest that the SNN extracts ameliorate NASH progression, possibly through blocking endotoxin related TLR4\/NF-\u03baB activation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c64","authors":["Shu, Xiangbing"],"doi":"10.1155\/2017\/9208314","first_seen_on":"2017-08-04T20:30:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1741-427X","1741-4288"],"journal":"Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)","last_mentioned_on":1501849627,"links":["https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2017\/9208314\/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2017\/9208314.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5555014","pmid":"28831287","pubdate":"2017-07-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Extracts of Salvia-Nelumbinis Naturalis Ameliorate Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis via Inhibiting Gut-Derived Endotoxin Mediated TLR4\/NF-\u03baB Activation","type":"article","volume":"2017"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":7193844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174398,"mean":11.882936759233,"rank":142738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174398,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4051,"mean":4.6808572839506,"rank":2871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4051,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":3.4807090909091,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lolitsjournals\/statuses\/893448211045654528","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23444671],"posted_on":"2017-08-04T12:27:07+00:00","author":{"name":"lolitsjournals","url":"http:\/\/keeganmclean.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/652288661413695488\/TMbtKL-d_normal.jpg","description":"Current journals on all things Chiropractic.
