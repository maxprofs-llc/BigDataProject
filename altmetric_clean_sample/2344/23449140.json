Host intestinal bacteria produce its precursor trimethylamine (TMA) from carnitine, choline, or choline-containing compounds. Most of the TMA produced is passively absorbed into portal circulation, and hepatic flavin-dependent monooxygenases (FMOs) efficiently oxidize TMA to TMAO. Both observational and experimental studies suggest a strong positive correlation between increased plasma TMAO concentrations and adverse cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. However, a clear mechanistic link between TMAO and such diseases is not yet validated. Therefore, it is debated whether increased TMAO concentrations are the cause or result of these diseases. Here, we have tried to review the current understanding of the properties and physiological functions of TMAO, its dietary sources, and its effects on human metabolism. Studies that describe the potential role of TMAO in the etiology of cardiovascular and other diseases are also discussed. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Nutrition Volume 37 is August 21, 2017.
