We investigated the role of vitamin D metabolites in regulating intact FGF23 production in genetically modified mice without and with adenine-induced uremia. Exogenous calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) and high circulating levels of calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) each increased serum FGF23 levels in wild-type mice and in mice with global deficiency of the Cyp27b1 gene encoding 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1-\u03b1-hydroxylase, which produces 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D. Compared with wild-type mice, normal, or uremic mice lacking Cyp27b1 had lower levels of serum FGF23, despite having high concentrations of parathyroid hormone, but administration of exogenous 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D increased FGF23 levels. Furthermore, raising serum calcium levels in Cyp27b1-depleted mice directly increased FGF23 levels and indirectly enhanced the action of ambient vitamin D metabolites via the vitamin D receptor. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, 25-hydroxyvitamin D promoted binding of the vitamin D receptor and retinoid X receptor to the promoters of osteoblastic target genes. Conditional osteoblastic deletion of Cyp27b1 caused lower serum FGF23 levels, despite normal circulating levels of vitamin D metabolites. In adenine-induced uremia, only a modest increase in serum FGF23 levels occurred in mice with osteoblastic deletion of Cyp27b1 (12-fold) compared with a large increase (58-fold) in wild-type mice. Therefore, in addition to the direct effect of high circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, local osteoblastic conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D appears to be an important positive regulator of FGF23 production, particularly in uremia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e9c","authors":["Loan Nguyen-Yamamoto","Andrew C.
