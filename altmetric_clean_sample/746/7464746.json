The newly designed primers and probe specifically amplified pork without any cross-reactivity with non-target animal species. The limit of detection of the real-time PCR assay was 0.1pg of heat-treated pork meat and 0.1% (w\/w) pork meat in beef and chicken meat mixtures. The quantitative real-time PCR assay was applied to analyze the pork meat content in 22 commercial processed meat products including jerkies, press hams, sausages, hamburger patties and steaks, grilled short rib patties, and nuggets. The developed real-time PCR method was able to detect pork meat in various types of processed meat products that declared the use of pork meat on their label. All processed meat products that declared no use of pork meat showed a negative result in the assay. The method developed in this study showed sensitivity and specificity in the quantification of pork meat in commercial processed meat products.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f5","authors":["Miju Kim","Insuk Yoo","Shin-Young Lee","Yeun Hong","Hae-Yeong Kim"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.foodchem.2016.04.084","endpage":"106","first_seen_on":"2016-05-15T01:25:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03088146","0308-8146"],"journal":"Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1463069246,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.foodchem.2016.04.084"],"pmid":"27211626","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"102","subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Quantitative detection of pork in commercial meat products by TaqMan\u00ae real-time PCR assay targeting the mitochondrial D-loop region","type":"article","volume":"210","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-detection-pork-commercial-meat-products-taqman-realtime-pcr-assay-targeting-mitochondri"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7690302,"mean":6.5973724521265,"rank":6653307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7690302,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269407,"mean":11.449561331225,"rank":224938,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269407,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3198,"mean":3.6542358461057,"rank":2432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3198,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":3.8371590909091,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
