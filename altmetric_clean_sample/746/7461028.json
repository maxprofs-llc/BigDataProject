We recently reported that di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate exposure reduces the abundance and inhibits the proliferation of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) IgM(+) B lymphocytes and expression of secreted immunoglobulin heavy-chain mu transcripts in an in vitro culture system. We proposed that phthalates act as immunomodulators by modifying the normal B cell-activation pathways by accelerating B cell differentiation while suppressing plasmablast expansion, thus resulting in fewer IgM-secreting plasma cells. This hypothesis was tested here in an in vivo field study of juvenile Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma) from a plastic-polluted lake in the Gulf of Alaska. Fish tissues were analyzed for both phthalate levels using liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry and for changes in immune gene expression using reverse transcriptase-real time polymerase chain reaction. Results showed that fish with higher tissue levels of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, di(n-butyl) phthalate, and\/or dimethyl phthalate expressed significantly fewer secreted and membrane-bound immunoglobulin heavy-chain mu and Blimp1 transcripts in their hematopoietic tissue. This suggests that in vivo uptake of phthalates in fish changes the expression of B cell-specific genes. Chronic exposure to phthalates likely dysregulates normal B-lymphoid development and antibody responses in salmonids and may increase susceptibility to infection. Given the conserved nature of B-lineage cells in vertebrate animals, other marine species may be similarly affected by chronic phthalate exposure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000649d","authors":["Kelly Martins","Birgit Hagedorn","Shareen Ali","John Kennish","Ben Applegate","Matthias Leu","Lidia Epp","Chris Pallister","Patty Zwollo","Martins, Kelly","Hagedorn, Birgit","Ali, Shareen","Kennish, John","Applegate, Ben","Leu, Matthias","Epp, Lidia","Pallister, Chris","Zwollo, Patty"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00244-016-0283-7","first_seen_on":"2016-05-14T19:32:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0703","0090-4341"],"journal":"Archives of Environmental Contamination & Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1463322050,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00244-016-0283-7","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27177745?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00244-016-0283-7.pdf","pmid":"27177745","pubdate":"2016-05-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ecotoxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Monitoring\/Analysis","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pollution, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Soil Science & Conservation","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Tissue Phthalate Levels Correlate With Changes in Immune Gene Expression in a Population of Juvenile Wild Salmon","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tissue-phthalate-levels-correlate-changes-immune-gene-expression-population-juvenile-wild-salmon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7700406,"mean":6.6097173252523,"rank":3704556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3935064,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7700406,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269653,"mean":11.442156698263,"rank":131814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":135062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269653,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1045,"mean":3.9391704980843,"rank":705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1045,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.96875,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
