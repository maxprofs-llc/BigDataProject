The increase of CIMT is affected by mutations in the osteopontin (OPN) promoters. The purpose of this study was to examine genetic variations in OPN promoters T-443C and G-156GG, identified in Javanese children with ischemic stroke parents, and to investigate their relationship with the increase of CIMT. A case-control analytic study was performed on 20 case and 12 control samples. Case samples were Javanese children aged between 10 to 21 years with ischemic stroke parents. Control samples were children with healthy parents. Mutations of T-443C and G-156GG were determined by employing polymerase chain reaction. Results of sequencing were analyzed using CLC Main Workbench 6.0. CIMT was defined using ultrasound. Genetic variations of T-443C were identified in six samples. Likewise, genetic variations of G-156GG were identified in six samples. Genetic variations in the OPN promoters T-443C and G-156GG were not potential risk factors in an increase of CIMT (P=0.654 and P=0.654). This study proves that genetic variations could be identified at the points of T-443C and G-156GG in children with ischemic stroke parents. Although statistically insignificant, the tendency to increase CIMT occurs in children with genetic variations. Children with ischemic stroke parents have thicker CIMT than children of healthy parents.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc9d","authors":["Yuyun Yueniwati","Valentina Yurina","Nurus Sobah","Endang Rahayu"],"doi":"10.2147\/ijgm.s94537","first_seen_on":"2016-05-14T23:46:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-7074"],"journal":"International Journal of General Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1463192096,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/genetic-variations-in-the-osteopontin-promoters-t-443c-and-g-156gg-inc-peer-reviewed-article-IJGM"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=30355","pmcid":"PMC4869651","pmid":"27274305","pubdate":"2016-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"117","title":"Genetic variations in the osteopontin promoters T-443C and G-156GG increase carotid intima-media thickness","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-variations-osteopontin-promoters-t443c-g156gg-increase-carotid-intimamedia-thickness"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7695064,"mean":6.6060460035168,"rank":3762704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3736609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7695064,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269610,"mean":11.440574758261,"rank":134570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":124410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269610,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":326,"mean":6.1726892307692,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":326,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":5.4285714285714,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/vasolabs\/statuses\/731306659146960896","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7463634],"posted_on":"2016-05-14T02:14:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Joseph Ence","url":"http:\/\/vasolabs.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1301535016\/n685993195_887938_3251_normal.jpg","description":"Vasolabs: Live longer.
