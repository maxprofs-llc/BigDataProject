We aimed to look for factors which have an impact on career-choosing of psychiatry in Chinese university students. We invited 508 non-medical students (NM), 304 medical students without (MO) and 123 medical students with clinical internship experience (MW), to answer a matrix of 43 questions regarding factors influencing career-choosing of psychiatry. Answers to these questions were analyzed through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, once the latent factors were identified and structurally-validated, their mean scores in three groups of students were calculated. Five factors with five items each were identified, namely social status inferiority, career importance, practice reward, career preference, and practice stress. NM scored lower than MO and MW did on Social Status Inferiority; NM group scored higher than MO and MW groups did on Career Importance; MW scored lower than NM and MO did on Practice Reward and on Career Preference; Regarding Practice Stress, NM scored higher than MO did, who then in turn, scored higher than MW did. In addition, Practice Stress was positively correlated with advice of the medical educators; and Social Status Inferiority and Career Preference were positively correlated with the psychiatry teaching of the medical educators. Raising career rewards, improving social status, and reinforcing psychiatric education might help to recruit more medical students to specialize in psychiatry practicing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033ce","authors":["Jiawei Zhong","Luna Zheng","Xiaoling Chen","Qianqian Gao","Bingren Zhang","Wei Wang"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11126-016-9427-1","endpage":"748","first_seen_on":"2016-10-03T10:32:43+00:00","issns":["1573-6709"],"issue":"4","journal":"Psychiatric Quarterly","last_mentioned_on":1475491763,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs11126-016-9427-1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11126-016-9427-1.pdf","pmid":"26875102","pubdate":"2016-02-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sociology, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"739","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Influencing Factors on Choosing Psychiatry as a Career: An Exploration in Chinese University Students","type":"article","volume":"87","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influencing-factors-choosing-psychiatry-career-exploration-chinese-university-students"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7474500,"mean":6.4836868429538,"rank":5393239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1818420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7474500,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239893,"mean":12.5252631851,"rank":156095,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":71971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239893,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":315,"mean":7.4952993630573,"rank":235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":315,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.7276,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NL":1,"GB":1},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tomrusting\/statuses\/782895315359760384","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12394257],"posted_on":"2016-10-03T10:49:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom Rusting","url":"http:\/\/www.GGZfamiliecoaching.nl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000827730583\/f49236844efe11df876eb1ecd706f6c9_normal.jpeg","description":"Voormalig CEO.
