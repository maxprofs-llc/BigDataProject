Two pharmacists independently reviewed each report to confirm whether the error occurred in the ordering\/prescribing phase and was related to CPOE. For those related to CPOE, we assessed whether CPOE facilitated (actively contributed to) the error or failed to prevent the error (did not directly cause it, but optimal systems could have potentially prevented it). A previously developed taxonomy was iteratively refined to classify the reports.\nOf 2522 medication error reports, 1308 (51.9%) were related to CPOE. Of these, CPOE facilitated the error in 171 (13.1%) and potentially could have prevented the error in 1137 (86.9%). The most frequent categories of \"what happened to the patient\" were delays in medication reaching the patient, potentially receiving duplicate drugs, or receiving a higher dose than indicated. The most frequent categories for \"what happened in CPOE\" included orders not routed to or received at the intended location, wrong dose ordered, and duplicate orders. Variations were seen in the format, categorization, and quality of reports, resulting in error causation being assignable in only 403 instances (31%).\nErrors related to CPOE commonly involved transmission errors, erroneous dosing, and duplicate orders. More standardized safety reporting using a common taxonomy could help health care systems and vendors learn and implement prevention strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5743cf058f610004cca","authors":["Mary G Amato","Alejandra Salazar","Thu-Trang T Hickman","Arbor JL Quist","Lynn A Volk","Adam Wright","Dustin McEvoy","William L Galanter","Ross Koppel","Beverly Loudin","Jason Adelman","John D McGreevey","David H Smith","David W Bates","Gordon D Schiff","Amato, Mary G","Salazar, Alejandra","Hickman, Thu-Trang T","Quist, Arbor Jl","Volk, Lynn A","Wright, Adam","McEvoy, Dustin","Galanter, William L","Koppel, Ross","Loudin, Beverly","Adelman, Jason","McGreevey, John D","Smith, David H","Bates, David W","Schiff, Gordon D","Quist, Arbor JL"],"doi":"10.1093\/jamia\/ocw125","first_seen_on":"2016-10-03T09:43:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1527-974X","1067-5027"],"journal":"Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association","last_mentioned_on":1504654027,"links":["http:\/\/jamia.oxfordjournals.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/ocw125v1?rss=1","http:\/\/jamia.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/09\/27\/jamia.ocw125","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27678459","http:\/\/jamia.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/09\/27\/jamia.ocw125?platform=hootsuite","https:\/\/jamia.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/09\/27\/jamia.ocw125","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jamia\/article-abstract\/24\/2\/316\/2631509\/Computerized-prescriber-order-entry-related?redirectedFrom=fulltext"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jamia.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/jaminfo\/early\/2016\/09\/27\/jamia.ocw125.full.pdf","pmid":"27678459","pubdate":"2016-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"ocw125","subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Computerized prescriber order entry-related patient safety reports: analysis of 2522 medication errors.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/computerized-prescriber-order-entryrelated-patient-safety-reports-analysis-2522-medication-errors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":22.55,"score_history":{"1y":22.55,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":22.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366342,"mean":7.0541652571821,"rank":393165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7972888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366342,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252743,"mean":12.768201541493,"rank":21462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":231254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252743,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1680,"mean":10.300484812388,"rank":153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":1527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1680,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":10.3441,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":19,"researcher":2,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":19,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
