Mammography, clinical breast examination (CBE), and breast self-examination (BSE) are recommended methods to detect early breast cancer in women. Many strategies have been developed to increase the rates of mammography, CBE, and BSE among Turkish women. Despite the benefits of breast cancer screening, these modalities are still underutilized by the majority of Turkish women.\nTo systematically review the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of various strategies aimed at improving screening behaviors for breast cancer in Turkish women.\nA systematic review of the literature published between 2000 and 2015 was conducted, searching 10 databases of Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Google Scholar, ULAKBIM Turkish Medical Database, and Council of Higher Education Thesis Center.\nTwenty-three studies were included in the final review. The majority of the studies investigated the effects of multiple strategies to improve BSE. Group education comprised educational sessions, printed and audiovisual materials, which significantly improved BSE, CBE, and mammography screening rates at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the intervention. One-to-one education demonstrated no significant difference in BSE rates at 6-month and 12-month follow-up. However, one-to-one education demonstrated significant differences in CBE and mammography rates at the 3-month follow-up.\nThe use of group education comprising a multicomponent intervention demonstrated an increase in breast-screening behaviors among Turkish women. Further research investigating the duration of educational interventions is needed in order to suggest a \"dose response.\"","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005d4f","authors":["Secginli, Selda","Nahcivan, Nursen O.","Gunes, Gussun","Fernandez, Ritin"],"doi":"10.1111\/wvn.12245","first_seen_on":"2017-06-12T17:18:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1741-6787"],"journal":"Worldviews on evidence-based nursing (Online)","last_mentioned_on":1497287915,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/wvn.12245\/abstract;jsessionid=9E0F6AD9E9AF3CEDD3604D006F5B8785.f03t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/wvn.12245\/pdf","pmid":"28605115","pubdate":"2017-06-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Interventions Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Among Turkish Women With Global Implications: A Systematic Review","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interventions-promoting-breast-cancer-screening-among-turkish-women-global-implications-systematic-r"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":7222513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241853,"mean":12.612793716818,"rank":197392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241853,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300,"mean":3.2509632107023,"rank":230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.1166666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
