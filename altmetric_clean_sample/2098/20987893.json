To evaluate oxidative stress, TBAR's and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay were employed while comet assay and classic histology were used to estimate genotoxicity and cellular damage respectively. The results indicated significant increase (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in TBARs level (\u00b5mol\/g wet tissue); significant decrease (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in FRAP value (U\/mg tissue), significant increase (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in DNA damage and extensive abnormal histoarchitecture in ovarian samples procured from Okhla as compared to Wazirabad barrage. Thus, exposure to the increasing toxicity downstream the river is altering the activity of cellular total antioxidant capacity persuading oxidative stress and cellular damage, eventually distressing the heath of fish fauna directly and humans indirectly.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000649f","authors":["Anil K.
