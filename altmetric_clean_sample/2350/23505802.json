Higher concentrations were tested and Caf induced late apoptosis or necrosis in HEp-2 cells, while propolis induced apoptosis, both probably due to ROS generation. P53 expression was downregulated by propolis but not by Caf. CASPASE-3 expression was correlated with induction of both early and late apoptosis, with both propolis and Caf alone upregulating its expression. Propolis induced cell cycle arrest at G2\/M phase and Caf at S phase. Propolis but not Caf may act as a P-gp inhibitor by modulating P-gp activity and inhibiting DOX efflux.\nPropolis exerted cytotoxic effects on HEp-2 cells, and the mechanisms are discussed, showing its potential as an antitumour drug.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002eb9","authors":["da Silva, L\u00edvia M.","Fri\u00f3n-Herrera, Yahima","Bartolomeu, Ariane R.","Gorgulho, Carolina Mendon\u00e7a","Sforcin, Jos\u00e9 M."],"doi":"10.1111\/jphp.12789","first_seen_on":"2017-08-08T05:13:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-3573","2042-7158"],"journal":"Journal of Pharmacy & Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1502112173,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28776672"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jphp.12789\/pdf","pmid":"28776672","pubdate":"2017-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacy","pharmacology"],"title":"Mechanisms involved in the cytotoxic action of Brazilian propolis and caffeic acid against HEp-2 cells and modulation of P-glycoprotein activity","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanisms-involved-cytotoxic-action-brazilian-propolis-caffeic-acid-against-hep2-cells-modulation-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":7207978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173986,"mean":12.112525734977,"rank":142302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173986,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":757,"mean":2.8708095238095,"rank":615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":757,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.5916666666667,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
