A nonlinear curve fitting equation capable of extracting specific binding constants in the presence of non-specific binding without the need of reference compounds was proposed and tested. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was first used to rapidly screen the small molecule candidates, then the stoichiometry and affinity constants of the native state binding pair in solution were obtained with capillary electrophoresis frontal analysis (CE-FA). B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) oncogene is directly responsible for the expression of Bcl-2 protein, which plays a significant role in cell apoptosis. The binding of G-quadruplex formed in the promoter region of Bcl-2 oncogene with small-molecule could stabilize the quadruplex structure, and potentially regulates the transcription of Bcl-2. Four natural product drug candidates were tested for their activity to bind the Bcl-2 promoter G-quadruplex. Using this reference-free method based on the CE-FA data, jatorrhizine and palmatine were found to bind specifically to the Bcl-2 promoter G-quadruplex with stoichiometries of 4:1 and 3:1, respectively.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Qian, Cheng","Fu, Hengqing","Kovalchik, Kevin A","Li, Huihui","Chen, David Da Yong","Cheng Qian","Hengqing Fu","Kevin A.
