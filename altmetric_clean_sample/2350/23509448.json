Compelling evidence supports the hypothesis that misfolded \u03b1-syn transmits from neuron-to-neuron and seeds aggregation of the protein in the recipient cells. Furthermore, \u03b1-syn frequently appears to propagate in the brains of PD patients following a stereotypic pattern consistent with progressive spreading along anatomical pathways. We have generated a C. elegans model that mirrors this progression and allows us to monitor \u03b1-syn neuron-to-neuron transmission in a live animal over its lifespan. We found that modulation of autophagy or exo\/endocytosis, affects \u03b1-syn transfer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that silencing C. elegans orthologs of PD-related genes also increases the accumulation of \u03b1-syn. This novel worm model is ideal for screening molecules and genes to identify those that modulate prion-like spreading of \u03b1-syn in order to target novel strategies for disease modification in PD and other synucleinopathies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Trevor Tyson","Megan Senchuk","Jason F.
