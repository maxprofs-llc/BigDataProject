Using extensive molecular dynamics simulations we calculate the calorimetric enthalpy of the PNIPAM collapse transition and observe a unique fingerprint of PNIPAM cononsolvency which is analysed in terms of microscopic interactions. We find that polymer hydration is the determining factor for PNIPAM collapse in the cononsolvency regime. In particular, it is shown that methanol frustrates the ability of water to form hydrogen bonds with the amide proton and therefore causes polymer collapse.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec5","authors":["Cahit Dalgicdir","Francisco Rodr\u00edguez-Ropero","Nico F.
