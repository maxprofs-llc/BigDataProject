GP referrals to hospital ophthalmology decreased differentially by 30.2% (95% CI -0.468% to -0.137%) for first attendances in the other intervention area (Lambeth). Costs increased by 3.1% in the comparison area between 2011\/2012 and 2013\/2014. Over the same period, costs increased by less (2.5%) in one intervention area and fell by 13.8% in the other intervention area.\nIntermediate-tier services based in the community could potentially reduce volumes of patients referred to hospitals by GPs and provide replacement services at lower unit costs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Thomas Mason","Cheryl Jones","Matt Sutton","Evgenia Konstantakopoulou","David F Edgar","Robert A Harper","Stephen Birch","John G Lawrenson"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-014089","first_seen_on":"2017-07-11T13:44:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"7","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1499849183,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/7\/7\/e014089?ct=","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/7\/7\/e014089?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/bmjopen\/7\/7\/e014089.full.pdf","pmid":"28698317","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","startpage":"e014089","title":"Retrospective economic analysis of the transfer of services from hospitals to the community: an application to an enhanced eye care service","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retrospective-economic-analysis-transfer-services-hospitals-community-application-enhanced-eye-care"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.15,"score_history":{"1y":6.15,"6m":6.15,"3m":6.15,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.15},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200733,"mean":6.9347145888862,"rank":1328192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6870390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200733,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179898,"mean":11.323620282717,"rank":38702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":141050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179898,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5982,"mean":16.887023240261,"rank":2209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5982,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":421,"mean":10.191880952381,"rank":136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":421,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":6,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jglawrenson\/statuses\/884680024095428608","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21768273],"posted_on":"2017-07-11T07:45:28+00:00","author":{"name":"John G.
