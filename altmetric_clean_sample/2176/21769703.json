This is significant because release of serotonin from platelets augments their aggregation; so use of SSRIs could, in theory, predispose patients to bleeding disorders. Case reports have suggested a link between SSRIs and easy bruising, nosebleeds, menorrhagia, petechial, ocular, small bowel, rectal and cerebral haemorrhages, and a prolonged bleeding time. Also, the summaries of product characteristics (SPCs) for all SSRIs include warnings about use in patients with a history of bleeding disorders or concomitant use with drugs known to affect platelet function. Here we review the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with the use of SSRIs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000589a","first_seen_on":"2017-07-11T13:57:12+00:00","issns":["0012-6543"],"issue":"3","journal":"Drug & Therapeutics Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1499768373,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/15038078\/"],"pmid":"15038078","pubdate":"2004-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Do SSRIs cause gastrointestinal bleeding?","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ssris-cause-gastrointestinal-bleeding"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8193064,"mean":6.9264840328884,"rank":4344012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2276428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8193064,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177642,"mean":11.296055302548,"rank":96854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":63110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177642,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":362,"mean":4.5672132963989,"rank":220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":362,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.8214285714286,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MensHealthAfric\/statuses\/884718798284226560","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21769703],"posted_on":"2017-07-11T10:19:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Men's Health Africa","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3710230794\/89bd6f39ce2b22e1e5186a033c375d32_normal.jpeg","description":"Men's Health Africa offers a platform for men to talk about men's health concerns.
