An accurate assessment of mortality and morbidity is essential to provide effective care and treatment and benchmarking of these issues is required to enhance outcomes and define standards.\nTo benchmark outcomes for women and babies following a diagnosis of hypertension between obstetric units in similar settings.\nUtilising a set of pre-defined clinical indicators, Individual Patient Data analysis techniques applied to the medical records of all women diagnosed with a HDP over a 12month period at six obstetric units within Australia and Canada. Statistical analysis included contingency table sand means testing oas appropriate utilising IBM SPSS V.18.\nOverall HDP rate of 7.6% of all deliveries, with a 3.0% preeclampsia rate. Outcomes differed significantly between units and did not cluster within any individual unit.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f6100085b4","authors":["Charlene Thornton","Jane Tooher","Robert Ogle","Peter von Dadelszen","Angela Makris","Annemarie Hennessy","Thornton, Charlene","Tooher, Jane","Ogle, Robert","von Dadelszen, Peter","Makris, Angela","Hennessy, Annemarie"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.preghy.2016.04.009","first_seen_on":"2016-07-18T16:38:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"1959.7\/uws:36253","handles":["1959.7\/uws:36253"],"isbns":[],"issns":["22107789","2210-7797"],"issue":"4","journal":"Pregnancy Hypertension: An International Journal of Women's Cardiovascular Health","last_mentioned_on":1484911513,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=1&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pregnancyhypertension.org%2Farticle%2FS2210-7789%2816%2930028-9%2Fabstract%3Fplatform%3Dhootsuite&code=preghy-site","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.preghy.2016.04.009"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pregnancyhypertension.org\/article\/S2210778916300289\/pdf","pmid":"27939468","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Benchmarking the Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S2210778916300289","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/benchmarking-hypertensive-disorders-pregnancy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8089090,"mean":6.870452360944,"rank":4275469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2247024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8089090,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257941,"mean":11.961737830503,"rank":141638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":90535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257941,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168,"mean":1.1984431137725,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":5.01,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pvondadelszen\/statuses\/822404610337992704","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9827473],"posted_on":"2017-01-20T11:25:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Peter von Dadelszen","url":"http:\/\/pre-empt.cfri.ca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/781951479846436864\/cLyIQoVL_normal.jpg","description":"NZ-, UK- & Canadian-trained obstetrican & scientist at SGUL, husband of Laura Magee, father of Eddie, Tess, Emma, Piers & Will, & lifelong All Blacks fan!","id_on_source":"pvondadelszen","tweeter_id":"585884740","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":240},"tweet_id":"822404610337992704"}]}}
