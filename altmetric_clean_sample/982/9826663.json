MIS-TLIF is commonly performed using intraoperative two-dimensional fluoroscopic x-rays. However, intraoperative CT based navigation during MIS-TLIF is gaining popularity for improvements in visualizing anatomy and reducing intraoperative radiation to surgeons and operating room staff. This is the first study to compare clinical outcomes and cost between these two imaging techniques during MIS- TILF.\n28 patients who underwent single level MIS-TLIF using fluoroscopy were matched to 28 patients undergoing a single level MIS-TLIF using CT navigation based on race, sex, age, smoking status, payer type, and medical comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity index). The minimum follow-up was six months. The two groups were compared in regards to clinical outcomes and hospital reimbursement from the payer perspective.\nAverage surgery time, anesthesia time, and length of stay were similar for both groups, but average estimated blood loss (EBL) was lower in the fluoroscopy group compared to CT navigation group (154 mL vs. 262 mL, p=0.016). ODI, back VAS, and leg VAS scores similarly improved in both groups (p>0.05) at six-month follow-up. Cost analysis showed that average hospital payments were similar in the fluoroscopy versus the CT navigation groups ($32,347 vs. $32,656, p=0.925) as well as payments for the operating room (p=0.868).\nSingle MIS-TLIF performed with fluoroscopy versus navigation showed similar clinical outcomes and cost at six months.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d13","authors":["Khanna, Ryan","McDevitt, Joseph L","Abecassis, Zachary A","Smith, Zachary A","Koski, Tyler R","Fessler, Richard G","Dahdaleh, Nader S","Ryan Khanna","Joseph L.
