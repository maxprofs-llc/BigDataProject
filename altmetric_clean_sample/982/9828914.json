The role of outdoor stay during school time for pupils' free-living PA vs. physical education (PE) and indoor stay was studied during one academic year in 196 pupils aged 7-14 years at four schools in mid-southern Sweden during five consecutive days each in September, March, and May. Actigraph GT3X+ Activity monitors were used. Predictors for PA during school stay were expressed as mean daily accelerometer counts and were measured per season, day, grade, gender, weather, and time outdoors. Overall, free-living PA outdoors generated the highest mean accelerometer counts for moderate and vigorous PA. Outdoor PA and PE, representing 23.7% of the total school time contributed to 50.4% of total mean accelerometer counts, and were the greatest contributors to moderate and vigorous PA. Age and weather impacted PA, with less PA in inclement weather and among older pupils. More time outdoors, at all seasons, would favorably increase school children's chances of reaching recommended levels of PA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f6100078a4","authors":["Pagels, Peter","Raustorp, Anders","Guban, Peter","Fr\u00f6berg, Andreas","Boldemann, Cecilia","Peter Pagels"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijerph13070699","first_seen_on":"2016-07-18T18:13:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1660-4601"],"issue":"7","journal":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1499487101,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27420079","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/13\/7\/699\/htm"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/13\/7\/699\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4962240","pmid":"27420079","pubdate":"2016-07-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"699","subjects":["publichealth","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Compulsory School In- and Outdoors\u2014Implications for School Children\u2019s Physical Activity and Health during One Academic Year","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/compulsory-school-outdoorsimplications-school-childrens-physical-activity-health-during-one-academic-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.55,"score_history":{"1y":2.95,"6m":0.85,"3m":0.85,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8177940,"mean":6.9186814093318,"rank":1687300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6483027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8177940,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258660,"mean":12.010620979745,"rank":68676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":189601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258660,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3110,"mean":7.7132454165326,"rank":727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":2379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3110,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166,"mean":4.4551515151515,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
