Lumbar puncture revealed cytoalbuminological dissociation. Due to her recent travel, Zika-associated Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) was suspected and she underwent evaluation for recent flavivirus exposure. Zika virus RNA was not detected in serum, but Zika virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) was detected in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Dengue virus IgM in serum was equivocal and dengue virus IgG was detected in the serum. Plaque-reduction neutralization testing showed elevated titers to both Zika virus and dengue virus, providing evidence of recent infection with a flavivirus. The patient was diagnosed with probable Zika virus-associated GBS based on clinical findings, ancillary testing, and laboratory assays according to current guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. Zika virus transmission in the Americas is resulting in increasing numbers of patients presenting with Zika virus-associated neurological syndromes. Clinical and laboratory diagnosis in these cases can be challenging and may be aided by consultation with CDC, and state and local public health agencies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f6e","authors":["Eliza Miller","Zoe Becker","Daniel Shalev","Christopher T.
