The common analysis of NIRS data uses the modified Beer-Lambert law, which is an empirical formulation that assumes global concentration changes. We used simulations to examine the errors that result when this analysis is applied to focal hemodynamic changes, and we performed simultaneous NIRS measurements during a motor task in adult humans and a neonate to evaluate the dependence of the measured changes on detector-probe geometry. For both simulations and in vivo measurements, the wide range of NIRS results was compared to an imaging analysis, diffuse optical tomography (DOT). The results demonstrate that relative changes in [HbO] and [Hb] cannot, in general, be quantified with NIRS. In contrast to that method, DOT analysis was shown to accurately quantify simulated changes in chromophore concentrations. These results and the general principles suggest that DOT can accurately measure changes in [Hb] and [HbO], but NIRS cannot accurately determine even relative focal changes in these chromophore concentrations. For the standard NIRS analysis to become more accurate for focal changes, it must account for the position of the focal change relative to the source and detector as well as the wavelength dependent optical properties of the medium.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003196","authors":["David A.
