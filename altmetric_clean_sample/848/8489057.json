Best"],"citation":{"abstract":"A systematic review was performed (i) to describe the reported overall rate of progression of CF lung disease quantified as FEV1%predicted decline with age, (ii) to summarise identified influencing risk factors and (iii) to review methods used to analyse CF lung disease progression data. A search of publications providing FEV1%predicted values over age was conducted in PUBMED and EMBASE. Baseline and rate of FEV1%predicted decline were summarised overall and by identified risk factors. Thirty-nine studies were included and reported variable linear rates of lung function decline in patients with CF. The overall weighted mean FEV1%predicted over age was graphically summarised and showed a nonlinear, time-variant decline of lung function. Compared to their peers, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and pancreatic insufficiency were most commonly associated with lower baseline and more rapid FEV1%predicted declines respectively. Considering nonlinear models and drop-out in lung disease progression, analysis is lacking and more studies are warranted.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008434","authors":["Harun, Sabariah Noor","Wainwright, Claire","Klein, Kerenaftali","Hennig, Stefanie","Sabariah Noor Harun","Claire Wainwright","Kerenaftali Klein","Stefanie Hennig"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.prrv.2016.03.002","first_seen_on":"2016-06-05T10:20:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-0550","15260542"],"journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1501199854,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27259460?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27259460?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27259460?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1526054216000294"],"pmid":"27259460","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"A systematic review of studies examining the rate of lung function decline in patients with cystic fibrosis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-review-studies-examining-rate-lung-function-decline-patients-cystic-fibrosis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282957,"mean":6.9842712712639,"rank":3291972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4964026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282957,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272746,"mean":11.564231351628,"rank":93927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":177375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272746,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":352,"mean":1.9195954415954,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":352,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.549,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
