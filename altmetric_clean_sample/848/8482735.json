Identifying the correct plane of dissection may be difficult. A correct management of ileocecal and right colic vascular pedicles is pivotal to achieve an oncological resection and the adequate blood supply of ileal and colic stumps.\nWe describe a technique for TLRC with a duodenum-first approach. Using three ports, dividing the \"duodenal window\", ileocecal and right colic vascular pedicles, and the right ureter are easily identified. The procedure is completed with an intracorporal stapled side-by-side anastomosis.\nIn 2014, 19 patients underwent TLRC using this technique. The median operative time was 178\u00a0min (132-237\u00a0min) and median intraoperative blood loss reached 60\u00a0mL (10-400). Conversion rate was 15.8%. No urinary tract, vascular, duodenal injury or anastomotic fistula were reported. Fifteen patients (79%) underwent a colectomy for cancer with a median of 16 (7-27) harvested lymph-nodes and 100% of R0-resection. Minor morbidity (Clavien-Dindo I-II) was 52.6% mainly related to cardiopulmonary complications (26.3%). Severe morbidity (Clavien-Dindo\u00a0\u2265\u00a0III) was 10.5% (two patients), including one reoperation (due to a sepsis related to an intra-abdominal abscess) and one death (due to complications of an aortic aneurism). Median hospital stay was 7 days (2-23 days). Long-term outcomes are unremarkable.\nUsing three trocars, the \"duodenal window\" approach to TLRC is technically feasible and safe, with good outcomes. The early access to the duodenum and the exposure of ilea-cecal and right colic pedicles rationalizes the procedure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035fa","authors":["Alban Zarzavadjian Le Bian","Manuela Cesaretti","Claude Smadja","Renato Costi","Zarzavadjian Le Bian, Alban","Cesaretti, Manuela","Smadja, Claude","Costi, Renato"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.suronc.2016.04.001","endpage":"118","first_seen_on":"2016-06-04T21:03:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-3320","09607404"],"issue":"2","journal":"Surgical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1466244789,"links":["http:\/\/www.so-online.net\/article\/S0960-7404(16)30008-1\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27312038?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.so-online.net\/article\/S0960740416300081\/pdf","pmid":"27312038","pubdate":"2016-04-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"117","subjects":["neoplasms","generalsurgery"],"title":"Total laparoscopic right colectomy: The duodenal window first approach","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/total-laparoscopic-right-colectomy-duodenal-window-first-approach"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7912542,"mean":6.6949158185663,"rank":3920955,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3790187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7912542,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269835,"mean":11.400202398511,"rank":133942,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":125012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269835,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151,"mean":4.9287066666667,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":61,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"TR":1}}},"posts":{"googleplus":[{"url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/114047829200470750897\/posts\/QkicoVcvmhm","license":"public","citation_ids":[8482735],"posted_on":"2016-06-03T11:22:24+00:00","summary":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.suronc.2016.04.001 http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.suronc.2016.04.001","author":{"name":"Alban Le bian","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/114047829200470750897","image":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-XdUIqdMkCWA\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/4252rscbv5M\/photo.jpg?sz=50","id_on_source":"114047829200470750897"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/744107919470321664","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8482735],"posted_on":"2016-06-18T10:02:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"744107919470321664"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/744110695009128448","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8482735],"posted_on":"2016-06-18T10:13:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"744110695009128448"}]}}
