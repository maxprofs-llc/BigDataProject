Although BCDIN3D has been shown to increasetumorigenic phenotypes and invasiveness in MDA-MB-231 cells, its the clinical implications in breast cancer remain unclear.\nWe screened for BCDIN3D using tissue microarrays constructed from 250 patients who were histologically confirmed to have invasive ductal breast carcinoma at the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center.\nThe survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression showed that BCDIN3D expression level served as a prognostic factor for disease-free survival (P = 0.042). The prognostic value of BCDIN3D was most significant in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients (P = 0.007).\nBCDIN3D might serve as an important prognostic factor for TNBC patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Yao, Ling","Chi, Yayun","Hu, Xin","Li, Shan","Qiao, Feng","Wu, Jong","Shao, Zhi-Ming","Ling Yao","Yayun Chi","Xin Hu","Shan Li","Feng Qiao","Jong Wu","Zhi-Ming Shao"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.9656","first_seen_on":"2016-06-05T10:06:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1465121348,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27259993?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27259993","pubdate":"2015-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Elevated expression of RNA methyltransferase BCDIN3D predicts poor prognosis in breast cancer","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.oncotarget.com\/abstract\/9656","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/elevated-expression-rna-methyltransferase-bcdin3d-predicts-poor-prognosis-breast-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7856296,"mean":6.655704591281,"rank":6804102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7856296,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269216,"mean":11.400580093977,"rank":224372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269216,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029,"mean":2.9801596910812,"rank":5662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":7.779797752809,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/739397889160421377","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8488854],"posted_on":"2016-06-05T10:06:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"739397889160421377"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/739398642994282496","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8488854],"posted_on":"2016-06-05T10:09:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"739398642994282496"}]}}
