The bacterium was characterized by a polyphasic approach, including 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, polymerase \u03b1 subunit (rpoA) gene sequence analysis, determination of DNA G+C content, DNA-DNA hybridization with the type strain of Enterococcus ratti and analysis of phenotypic features. Strain 48(T) accounted for 96.1, 95.8, 95.8, and 95.7\u00a0% with Enterococcus faecium CGMCC 1.2136(T), Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790(T), Enterococcus durans CECT 411(T), and E. ratti ATCC 700914(T) in the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, respectively. The sequence of rpoA gene showed similarities of 99.0, 96.0, 96.0, and 96\u00a0% with that of E. faecium ATCC 19434(T), Enterococcus villorum LMG12287, E. hirae ATCC 9790(T), and E. durans ATCC 19432(T), respectively. Based upon of polyphasic characterization data obtained in the study, a novel species, Enterococcus xinjiangensis sp. nov., was proposed and the type strain was 48(T)(=CCTCC AB 2014041(T)\u00a0=\u00a0JCM 30200(T)).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000269a","authors":["Ren, Xiaopu","Li, Mingyang","Guo, Dongqi"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00284-016-1065-1","first_seen_on":"2016-06-05T11:24:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0991","0343-8651"],"journal":"Current Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1465125846,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27260143?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27260143","pubdate":"2016-06-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Enterococcus Xinjiangensis sp. nov., Isolated from Yogurt of Xinjiang, China","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7856296,"mean":6.655704591281,"rank":6804097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7856296,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269215,"mean":11.400588639521,"rank":224367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269215,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":617,"mean":2.8497727272727,"rank":453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":617,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":2.34875,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/entero_papers\/statuses\/739417507354673152","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8489544],"posted_on":"2016-06-05T11:24:06+00:00","author":{"name":"enterococcuspapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/704565898690965504\/8Fli7TxI_normal.jpg","description":"PubMed search bot for enterococcus","id_on_source":"entero_papers","tweeter_id":"704561547666808832","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":61},"tweet_id":"739417507354673152"}]}}
