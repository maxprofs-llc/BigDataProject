Practice restrictions and the undocumented concern that dental hygienists do not have the skill or knowledge to identify or diagnose a carious lesion impede access to care.\nThis study compared the identification of dental caries by both dental hygienists and dentists and by both clinical and teledentistry methods.\nA sample of 82 children 4-7 years of age attending an elementary school in Memphis, Tennessee, was selected for the study. Two clinical examiners, a dental hygienist and dentist, independently examined and charted dental caries and existing restorations separately on the children. Two teledentistry examiners, a dental hygienist and dentist, independently reviewed and charted dental caries and restorations from photographs obtained with the iPhone 4S. Dental charts for each child were converted to a decayed filled surface (DFS) score resulting in four scores for analyses.\nSeventy-eight children met the inclusion criteria. The clinical dentist's and clinical dental hygienist's DFS scores resulted in Spearman's correlation of r = 0.99. Friedman's analysis of the four examiners' DFS scores found no significant difference (P > 0.10) between the teledentistry dental hygienist's and the clinical dentist's scores.\nA dental hygienist can identify dental caries in children 4-7 years of age from photographs as accurately as a dentist in the clinical setting.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f61000599f","authors":["Daniel, S J","Kumar, S"],"doi":"10.1111\/idh.12232","first_seen_on":"2016-06-04T17:20:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1601-5037"],"journal":"International Journal of Dental Hygiene","last_mentioned_on":1465060822,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27256722"],"pmid":"27256722","pubdate":"2016-06-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Comparison of dental hygienists and dentists: clinical and teledentistry identification of dental caries in children","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-dental-hygienists-dentists-clinical-teledentistry-identification-dental-caries-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7851688,"mean":6.6523167403332,"rank":5955141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1051049,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7851688,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269242,"mean":11.392238826924,"rank":188154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269242,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296,"mean":3.9577898305085,"rank":240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.9,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
