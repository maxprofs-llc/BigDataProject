Secondary outcomes-disease profiles and predictors of mortality in different age categories.\nThere were 1454 admissions, 182 missing records, leaving 1272 admissions for review. Overall mortality rate was 25.7% (327\/1272). Mortality rate was 41.4% (121\/292) (95% CI 35.8% to 47.1%) for very low birthweight (VLBW) babies, 26.6% (120\/451) (95% CI 22.5% to 30.5%) for bigger babies and 16.2% (86\/529) (95% CI 13.1% to 19.3%) for paediatric patients. Risk factors for a reduced chance of survival to discharge in paediatric patients included postcardiac arrest (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.49), inotropic support (OR 0.085, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.17), hypernatraemia (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.6), bacterial sepsis (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.65) and lower respiratory tract infection (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.97). Major birth defects (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.74), persistent pulmonary hypertension of the new born (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.91), metabolic acidosis (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.74), inotropic support (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.45) and congenital heart defects (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.62) predicted decreased survival in bigger babies. Birth weight (OR 0.997, 95% CI 0.995 to 0.999), birth outside the hospital (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.84), HIV exposure (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99), resuscitation at birth (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.94), metabolic acidosis (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.60) and necrotising enterocolitis (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.46) predicted poor survival in VLBW babies.\nOngoing mortality review is essential to improve provision of paediatric critical care.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Ballot, Daynia E","Davies, Victor A","Cooper, Peter A","Chirwa, Tobias","Argent, Andrew","Mer, Mervyn"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2015-010850","first_seen_on":"2016-06-05T10:06:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"6","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1465121167,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27259525?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4893876","pmid":"27259525","pubdate":"2016-06-03T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"e010850","title":"Retrospective cross-sectional review of survival rates in critically ill children admitted to a combined paediatric\/neonatal intensive care unit in Johannesburg, South Africa, 2013\u20132015","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retrospective-crosssectional-review-survival-rates-critically-ill-children-admitted-combined-paediat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7856296,"mean":6.655704591281,"rank":6804103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7856296,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269215,"mean":11.400621512997,"rank":224372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269215,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5497,"mean":16.843077147016,"rank":5091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5497,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":371,"mean":21.244497297297,"rank":346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":371,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":8,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PH_Papers\/statuses\/739397882420154368","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8488852],"posted_on":"2016-06-05T10:06:07+00:00","author":{"name":"PHpapers","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CamKieff","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/580912794058428416\/h4SJZnKv_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot posting PubMeb #pulmonaryhypertension papers https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers #PH","id_on_source":"PH_Papers","tweeter_id":"3116709759","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":460},"tweet_id":"739397882420154368"}]}}
