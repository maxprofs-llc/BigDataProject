To complement standard detection and monitoring techniques, new approaches using environmental DNA (eDNA) have recently been developed. However, most of the eDNA work has focused on vertebrate species in spatially limited freshwater habitats while benthic invertebrates in coastal environments have received much less attention. Here, we evaluated the suitability of the eDNA approach for detecting benthic, hard-shelled, crustacean mud crab species in a brackish water environment. We demonstrated for the first time that eDNA from an introduced mud crab Rhithropanopeus harrisii can be successfully amplified in aquarium water samples and detected in the brackish water environment. However, the detection rate was rather low. This suggests that in contrast to freshwater vertebrates, it may be more challenging to develop a highly sensitive eDNA method for detecting crustacean species in a marine environment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006690","authors":["Forsstr\u00f6m, Tiia","Vasem\u00e4gi, Anti","Tiia Forsstr\u00f6m","Anti Vasem\u00e4gi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.marpolbul.2016.05.054","first_seen_on":"2016-06-05T10:01:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-3363","0025326X"],"journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1493202965,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27261280?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27261280?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27261280","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Earth and Planetary Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Can environmental DNA (eDNA) be used for detection and monitoring of introduced crab species in the Baltic Sea?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/environmental-dna-edna-used-detection-monitoring-introduced-crab-species-baltic-sea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083342,"mean":6.8946797770799,"rank":3461447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4506724,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083342,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271298,"mean":11.508144749112,"rank":107757,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":158810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271298,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2826,"mean":5.2819943362832,"rank":1464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":1339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2826,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153,"mean":3.1290921052632,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
