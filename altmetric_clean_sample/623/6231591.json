In both cases, physical examination was suggestive of a left-sided pleural effusion, confirmed by chest X-ray. Analysis of aspirated fluid showed a lymphocytic exudate, but cytological analysis was negative for malignancy in both patients. CT scan revealed malignancies as the underlying cause of the effusions. Both patients were managed with intercostal drainage in order to collect a sufficient amount of pleural fluid to perform a new technique in our hospital: cell block. This proved to be extremely useful in assessing the definitive diagnosis and management of both women. We briefly discuss the approach to a malignant pleural effusion and the aid of this not-so-new technique.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc98","authors":["Rafael Garc\u00eda Carretero","Manuela Manotas-Hidalgo","Marta Romero Brugera","Liliam El Bouayadi Mohamed"],"doi":"10.1136\/bcr-2016-215140","first_seen_on":"2016-03-18T20:25:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1757-790X"],"journal":"BMJ Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1458372821,"links":["http:\/\/casereports.bmj.com\/content\/2016\/bcr-2016-215140.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/casereports.bmj.com\/content\/2016\/bcr-2016-215140.full.pdf","pmid":"26994057","pubdate":"2016-03-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","startpage":"bcr2016215140","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Pleural effusion of malignant aetiology: cell block technique to establish the diagnosis","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pleural-effusion-malignant-aetiology-cell-block-technique-establish-diagnosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8148077,"mean":6.900681289908,"rank":3186877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4926025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8148077,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285292,"mean":11.087557623619,"rank":98039,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":185402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285292,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3173,"mean":5.0767206809584,"rank":702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":2461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3173,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156,"mean":5.5505419354839,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rafa_linux\/statuses\/710925072341536773","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6231591],"posted_on":"2016-03-18T20:25:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Rafalinux","url":"http:\/\/www.rafalinux.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/531195641758621696\/92IozgUk_normal.jpeg","description":"Introvertido, me gusta estar a mi aire.
