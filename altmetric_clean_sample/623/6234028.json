During chronic viral infection, immune-escape mutants on the preS2 region of LHBS (preS2-LHBS) are gain-of-function mutations that are linked to preneoplastic ground glass hepatocytes (GGHs) and early disease onset of hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we show that preS2-LHBS provoked calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and triggered stored-operated calcium entry (SOCE). The activation of SOCE increased ER and plasma membrane (PM) connections, which was linked by ER- resident stromal interaction molecule-1 (STIM1) protein and PM-resident calcium release- activated calcium modulator 1 (Orai1). Persistent activation of SOCE induced centrosome overduplication, aberrant multipolar division, chromosome aneuploidy, anchorage-independent growth, and xenograft tumorigenesis in hepatocytes expressing preS2- LHBS. Chemical inhibitions of SOCE machinery and silencing of STIM1 significantly reduced centrosome numbers, multipolar division, and xenograft tumorigenesis induced by preS2-LHBS. These results provide the first mechanistic link between calcium homeostasis and chromosome instability in hepatocytes carrying preS2-LHBS. Therefore, persistent activation of SOCE represents a novel pathological mechanism in HBV-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Yen, Tim Ting-Chung","Yang, Anderson","Chiu, Wen-Tai","Li, Tian-Neng","Wang, Lyu-Han","Wu, Yi-Hsuan","Wang, Hui-Chen","Chen, Linyi","Wang, Wen-Ching","Huang, Wenya","Chang, Chien-Wen","Chang, Margaret Dah-Tsyr","Shen, Meng-Ru","Su, Ih-Jen","Wang, Lily Hui-Ching"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.8109","first_seen_on":"2016-03-19T10:05:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"17","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1458381886,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26992221?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5029631","pmid":"26992221","pubdate":"2014-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Hepatitis B virus PreS2-mutant large surface antigen activates store-operated calcium entry and promotes chromosome instability","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hepatitis-b-virus-pres2mutant-large-surface-antigen-activates-storeoperated-calcium-entry-promotes-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7410208,"mean":6.44364379996,"rank":5606316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":996239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7410208,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278399,"mean":10.891328752361,"rank":195460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":43160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278399,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6683,"mean":2.8371966477103,"rank":3396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":1923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6683,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":432,"mean":2.1071554524362,"rank":252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":432,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
