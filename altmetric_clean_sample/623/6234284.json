However, the impact of neuronal morphology on the diffusion and redistribution of intracellular Cl(-) is not well understood. The role of spines in Cl(-) diffusion along dendritic trees has not been addressed so far. Because measuring fast and spatially restricted Cl(-) changes within dendrites is not yet technically possible, we used computational approaches to predict the effects of spines on Cl(-) dynamics in morphologically complex dendrites. In all morphologies tested, including dendrites imaged by super-resolution STED microscopy in live brain tissue, spines slowed down longitudinal Cl(-) diffusion along dendrites. This effect was robust and could be observed in both deterministic as well as stochastic simulations. Cl(-) extrusion altered Cl(-) diffusion to a much lesser extent than the presence of spines. The spine-dependent slowing of Cl(-) diffusion affected the amount and spatial spread of changes in the GABA reversal potential thereby altering homosynaptic as well as heterosynaptic short-term ionic plasticity at GABAergic synapses in dendrites. Altogether, our results suggest a fundamental role of dendritic spines in shaping Cl(-) diffusion, which could be of relevance in the context of pathological conditions where spine densities and neural excitability are perturbed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Mohapatra, Namrata","T\u00f8nnesen, Jan","Vlachos, Andreas","Kuner, Thomas","Deller, Thomas","N\u00e4gerl, U Valentin","Santamaria, Fidel","Jedlicka, Peter","Namrata Mohapatra","Jan T\u00f8nnesen","Andreas Vlachos","Thomas Kuner","Thomas Deller","U.
