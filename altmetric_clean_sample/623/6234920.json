Only K(+) ions could induce the Yb(3+) complex to form a 1D coordination polymer and promote the in situ formation of an NIR membrane coated with bigger Yb(3+) complex crystallites under mild conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e2","authors":["Chen, Wanmin","Tang, Xiaoliang","Dou, Wei","Ju, Zhenghua","Xu, Benhua","Xu, Wenxuan","Liu, Weisheng"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6cc01938b","first_seen_on":"2016-03-19T10:22:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1364-548X","1359-7345"],"journal":"Chemical Communications","last_mentioned_on":1458382931,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26987655?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26987655","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"\n              K\n              +\n              -Induced in situ self-assembly of near-infrared luminescent membrane material armored with bigger Yb(\n              iii\n              ) complex crystallites\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/k-induced-situ-selfassembly-nearinfrared-luminescent-membrane-material-armored-bigger-yb-iii-complex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7410208,"mean":6.44364379996,"rank":5606324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":996198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7410208,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278399,"mean":10.891367366145,"rank":195466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":43140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278399,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5326,"mean":2.9425941784038,"rank":3464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":1065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5326,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203,"mean":2.8491089108911,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
