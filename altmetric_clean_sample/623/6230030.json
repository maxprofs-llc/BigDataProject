Its high frequency of occurrence and poor survival rate have garnered much research attention in recent years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to be related to the formation and progression of several cancer types by both promoting and suppressing tumor transformation. H19 is one such lncRNA and has been shown to be upregulated in a few types of cancer. In this study, we discovered that the expression of H19 increased in GBM cell lines. H19 knocked down GBM cells also displayed decreased cellular proliferation and a higher apoptosis rate when induced by temozolomide. Interestingly, the GBM cell lines U87MG and U251 were found to express cancer stem cell markers CD133, NANOG, Oct4 and Sox2. Expression of these markers was downregulated in H19-deficient cells. Collectively, these data suggest a role for H19 in contributing to GBM malignancy and the maintenance of its stem cell properties.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c8","authors":["Li, Weiguo","Jiang, Pengfei","Sun, Xiaoling","Xu, Shujun","Ma, Xiangyu","Zhan, Rucai"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10571-015-0320-5","first_seen_on":"2016-03-18T13:10:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-6830","0272-4340"],"journal":"Cellular & Molecular Neurobiology","last_mentioned_on":1458306604,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26983719?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10571-015-0320-5"],"pmid":"26983719","pubdate":"2016-03-18T22:01:29+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","neurology"],"title":"Suppressing H19 Modulates Tumorigenicity and Stemness in U251 and U87MG Glioma Cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/suppressing-h19-modulates-tumorigenicity-stemness-u251-u87mg-glioma-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7408484,"mean":6.4406978049309,"rank":5344926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1803686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7408484,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279899,"mean":10.842148146825,"rank":180750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":83441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279899,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":423,"mean":2.4369336492891,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":423,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":2.9608695652174,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
