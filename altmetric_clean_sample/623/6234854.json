Studies were characterised based on their objective, design, status upon MA and due data set by authorities. They were linked to online study registrations (Clinicaltrials.gov, ENCePP) to determine completion date. We described and associated characteristics of studies and medicines and determined whether studies were completed in time.\nA total of 59 post-marketing studies were requested for 21 conditionally authorised medicines. Most studies had an interventional study design (73%), were ongoing upon MA (61%) and aimed to provide additional data on efficacy (45%). Interventional studies were more often ongoing and providing efficacy data, while observational and other studies were more often new and providing safety data. Frequent grounds for requesting post-marketing studies were 'long-term follow-up' and 'increase data on subpopulations'. Of the 34 studies eligible for follow-up analysis, 26 (76%) were completed and 17 (50%) completed in time. Actual completion time took a median (IQR) of 274 (-121 - 556) days longer than expected.\nOur results indicate that most post-marketing studies attached to a conditional marketing authorisation were eventually completed, but half were completed with a substantial delay. The observations suggest caution when broadening the use of post-marketing studies for resolving uncertainties about benefits and risks after MA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000243e","authors":["Hoekman, Jarno","Klamer, Thea T","Mantel-Teeuwisse, Aukje K","Leufkens, Hubert G M","De Bruin, Marie L","Klamer, Thea T.","Mantel\u2010Teeuwisse, Aukje K.","Leufkens, Hubert G.
