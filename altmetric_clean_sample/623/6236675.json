Their criminal conviction rates and time spent in prison per year were compared for the periods before and after the start of their methadone programme. Overall, patients retained on methadone programmes in the general practices studied had significantly fewer convictions and cautions, and spent significantly less time in prison than they had before the start of treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006d12","authors":["Keen, J","Rowse, G","Mathers, N","Campbell, M","Seivewright, N","J Keen","G Rowse","N Mathers","M Campbell","N Seivewright"],"first_seen_on":"2016-03-19T11:22:27+00:00","issns":["0960-1643"],"issue":"450","journal":"British Journal of General Practice","last_mentioned_on":1464006139,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1313612\/pdf\/10695069.pdf","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1313612\/"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1313612\/pdf\/10695069.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1313612","pmid":"10695069","pubdate":"2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Royal College of General Practitioners","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"48","subjects":["primaryhealthcare"],"title":"Can methadone maintenance for heroin-dependent patients retained in general practice reduce criminal conviction rates and time spent in prison?","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/methadone-maintenance-heroindependent-patients-retained-general-practice-reduce-criminal-conviction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7737442,"mean":6.6309810015932,"rank":1613727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6070246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7737442,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281649,"mean":10.970021622734,"rank":77550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":203221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281649,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1808,"mean":9.3481140011068,"rank":661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1808,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":15.592345679012,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
