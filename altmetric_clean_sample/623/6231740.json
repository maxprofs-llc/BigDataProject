DNA, antibody and lectin probes have previously been used to provide rapid and specific detection of species and strains in complex field assemblages. Recently, however, well-documented cryptic genetic diversity within the group has confounded results of DNA probe tests in particular. Moreover, the number of species descriptions within the genus continues to increase, as do insights into toxin production by both new and previously described species. Therefore, a combination of classical morphological techniques and modern molecular methodologies is needed to resolve ecophysiological traits of Pseudo-nitzschia species. Here, we present an approach to recover and identify frustules from sample collection filters used for toxin analysis onboard the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP), an in\u00a0situ sample collection and analytical platform. This approach provides a new and powerful tool for correlating species presence with toxin detected remotely and in\u00a0situ by the ESP, and has the potential to be applied broadly to other sampling configurations. This new technique will contribute to a better understanding of naturally occurring Pseudo-nitzschia community structure with respect to observed domoic acid outbreaks.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec3","authors":["Bowers, Holly A","Marin, Roman","Birch, James M","Scholin, Christopher A","Doucette, Gregory J"],"doi":"10.1111\/jpy.12369","endpage":"140","first_seen_on":"2016-03-18T21:14:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1529-8817"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Phycology","last_mentioned_on":1458335674,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26987095?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26987095","pubdate":"2016-02-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"135","title":"\n              Recovery and identification of\n              Pseudo-nitzschia\n              (Bacillariophyceae) frustules from natural samples acquired using the environmental sample processor\n            ","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recovery-identification-pseudonitzschia-bacillariophyceae-frustules-natural-samples-acquired-using-e"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7408484,"mean":6.4406978049309,"rank":5604795,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":996156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7408484,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279899,"mean":10.842194235042,"rank":196468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":43430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279899,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":663,"mean":2.6934501510574,"rank":410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":663,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":2.0429230769231,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
