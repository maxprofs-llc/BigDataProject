KM-1 can utilize both hexose and pentose sugars for the intracellular storage of bioplastic poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (PHB) under aerobic conditions. In this study, we investigated the effects of the sodium nitrate concentration on PHB accumulation in the KM-1 strain. Unexpectedly, we observed the secretion of pyruvate, a central intermediate in carbon- and energy-metabolism processes in all organisms; therefore, pyruvate is widely used as a starting material in the industrial biosynthesis of pharmaceuticals and is employed for the production of crop-protection agents, polymers, cosmetics, and food additives. We then further analyzed pyruvate productivity following changes in culture temperature and the buffer concentration. In 48-h batch-cultivation experiments, we found that wild-type Halomonas sp. KM-1 secreted 63.3\u00a0g\/L pyruvate at a rate of 1.32\u00a0g\/(L\u00b7h), comparable to the results of former studies using mutant and recombinant microorganisms. Thus, these data provided important insights into the production of pyruvate using this novel strain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008ac","authors":["Yoshikazu Kawata","Taku Nishimura","Isao Matsushita","Jun Tsubota"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13568-016-0195-y","first_seen_on":"2016-03-18T19:36:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2191-0855"],"issue":"1","journal":"AMB Express","last_mentioned_on":1458329757,"links":["http:\/\/amb-express.springeropen.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13568-016-0195-y?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed:%20amb-express\/xmvR%20(AMB%20Express)","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/s13568-016-0195-y"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/amb-express.springeropen.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13568-016-0195-y?site=http:\/\/amb-express.springeropen.com","pmid":"26989057","pubdate":"2016-03-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Efficient production and secretion of pyruvate from Halomonas sp.
