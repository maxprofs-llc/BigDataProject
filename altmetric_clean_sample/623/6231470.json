Functional studies revealed both growth suppression and proapoptotic activities for GLIPR1 in multiple cancer cell lines. GLIPR1's role in lung cancer has not been investigated. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is a protein arginine methyltransferase and forms a stoichiometric complex with the WD repeat domain 77 (WDR77) protein. Both PRMT5 and WDR77 are essential for growth of lung epithelial and cancer cells. But additional gene products that interact genetically or biochemichally with PRMT5 and WDR77 in the control of lung cancer cell growth are not characterized.\nDNA microarray and immunostaining were used to detect GLIPR1 expression during lung development and lung tumorigenesis. GLIPR1 expression was also analyzed in the TCGA lung cancer cohort. The consequence of GLIPR1 on growth of lung cancer cells in the tissue culture and lung tumor xenografts in the nude mice was observed.\nWe found that GLIPR1 expression is negatively associated with PRMT5\/WDR77. GLIPR1 is absent in growing epithelial cells at the early stages of mouse lung development and highly expressed in the adult lung. Expression of GLIPR1 was down-regulated during lung tumorigenesis and its expression suppressed growth of lung cancer cells in the tissue culture and lung tumor xenografts in mice. GLIPR1 regulates lung cancer growth through the V-Erb-B avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (ErbB3).\nThis study reveals a novel pathway that PRMT5\/WDR77 regulates GLIPR1 expression to control lung cancer cell growth and GLIPR1 as a potential therapeutic agent for lung cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000873","authors":["Xiumei Sheng","Nathan Bowen","Zhengxin Wang"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12943-016-0508-4","first_seen_on":"2016-03-18T19:41:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-4598"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1459243701,"links":["http:\/\/molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12943-016-0508-4?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12943-016-0508-4"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12943-016-0508-4?site=http:\/\/molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"26988096","pubdate":"2016-03-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"GLI pathogenesis-related 1 functions as a tumor-suppressor in lung cancer","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gli-pathogenesisrelated-1-functions-tumorsuppressor-lung-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7458268,"mean":6.4789686129458,"rank":3367297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4061366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7458268,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280329,"mean":10.866132373505,"rank":126168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":152341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280329,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":699,"mean":3.1694269340974,"rank":240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":699,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.4868421052632,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
