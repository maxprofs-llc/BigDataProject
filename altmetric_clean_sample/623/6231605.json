We selected observational studies reporting on hypoglycaemia and associated serious adverse events, and conducted a meta-analysis. We assessed study validity based on ascertainment of hypoglycaemia, adverse events and adjustment for confounders.\nWe included 17 studies involving 1.86 million participants. Meta-analysis of eight studies demonstrated that hypoglycemic episodes were associated with macrovascular complications, odds ratio (OR) 1.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64, 2.05), and microvascular complications in two studies OR 1.77 (95% CI 1.49, 2.10). Meta-analysis of four studies demonstrated an association between hypoglycaemia and falls or fractures, OR 1.89 (95% CI 1.54, 2.32) and 1.92 (95% CI 1.56, 2.38) respectively. Hypoglycaemia was associated with increased likelihood of death in a meta-analysis of eight studies, OR 2.04 (95% Confidence Interval 1.68, 2.47).\nOur meta-analysis raises major concerns about a range of serious adverse events associated with hypoglycaemia. Clinicians should prioritize individualized therapy and closer monitoring strategies to avoid hypoglycaemia in susceptible older patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d53","authors":["Katharina Mattishent","Yoon Kong Loke"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jdiacomp.2016.03.018","first_seen_on":"2016-03-18T20:30:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-460X","10568727"],"journal":"Journal of Diabetes & its Complications","last_mentioned_on":1458833027,"links":["http:\/\/www.jdcjournal.com\/article\/S1056-8727(16)30055-1\/abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1056872716300551"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jdcjournal.com\/article\/S1056872716300551\/pdf","pmid":"27083445","pubdate":"2016-03-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Meta-Analysis: Association between Hypoglycaemia and Serious Adverse Events in Older Patients","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metaanalysis-association-between-hypoglycaemia-serious-adverse-events-older-patients-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7997669,"mean":6.7438428511856,"rank":1074776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":6917232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7997669,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284628,"mean":10.982450898895,"rank":54860,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":229526,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284628,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":543,"mean":3.4916014760148,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":500,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":543,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":2.5315789473684,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
