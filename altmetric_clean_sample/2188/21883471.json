This food-based intervention has been questioned in conjunction with negative outcomes for smokers and asbestos-exposed populations of the CARET and ATBC trials in which very high doses of \u03b2-carotene were supplemented. The current notion that \u03b2-carotene cleavage products (apocarotenoids) represented the harmful agents is the basis of the here-presented research. We have quantitatively analyzed numerous plant food items and can conclude that neither the amounts of apocarotenoids nor of \u03b2-carotene provided by plant tissues, be they conventional or provitamin A-biofortified, pose an increased risk. We have also investigated \u03b2-carotene degradation pathways over time. This reveals a substantial non-enzymatic proportion of carotene decay and corroborates the quantitative relevance of highly oxidized \u03b2-carotene polymers that form in all plant tissues investigated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006625","authors":["Schaub, Patrick","Wuest, Florian","Koschmieder, Julian","Yu, Qiuju","Virk, Parminder","Tohme, Joe","Beyer, Peter","Patrick Schaub","Florian Wuest","Julian Koschmieder","Qiuju Yu","Parminder Virk","Joe Tohme","Peter Beyer","W\u00fcst, Florian","Florian W\u00fcst"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jafc.7b01693","first_seen_on":"2017-07-14T10:26:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"10568\/83288","handles":["10568\/83288"],"issns":["0021-8561","1520-5118"],"journal":"Journal of Agricultural & Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1504044451,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28703588?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.jafc.7b01693","https:\/\/cgspace.cgiar.org\/handle\/10568\/83288","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.jafc.7b01693"],"pmid":"28703588","pubdate":"2017-07-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society (ACS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Non-Enzymatic \u03b2-Carotene Degradation in (Provitamin A-Biofortified) Crop Plants","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonenzymatic-%CE%B2carotene-degradation-provitamin-abiofortified-crop-plants"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.356,"score_history":{"1y":11.356,"6m":11.356,"3m":11.356,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.356},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":773118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7673136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232531,"mean":12.956548944222,"rank":34340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":198191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232531,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6385,"mean":5.7968092105263,"rank":525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":5860,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6385,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127,"mean":5.6004603174603,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
