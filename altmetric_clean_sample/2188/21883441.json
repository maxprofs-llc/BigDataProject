Five microorganisms (S. aureus, E.coli, A. baumannii and C. parapsilosis, CNS) were prepared for use as contaminants of the MP. MP were incubated in Tryptic soy broth at 36 \u00b0C for 24 h, after which, they were seeded on a Biom\u00e9rieux\u00ae blood agar plate and incubated for 24 h at 36 \u00b0C.\n300 peritoneal dialysis bags were analyzed regarding the time expose to the disinfectant showed a statistically significant difference in the number of culture positive (7\/100) p = 0.001; Gram positive (6\/100) p = 0.006 for five seconds, one positive culture and turbid bag with ten seconds, while friction for 60 seconds showed all negative results. The comparison between disinfectant, alcohol or chlorhexidine, 150 bag in each group, showed that the ones disinfected with alcohol had 5 turbid bags, 8 positive cultures and 7 germs identified, while all bags disinfected with chlorhexidine were negative for all parameters, with a difference statistically significant (p = 0.004).\nOur results suggest that the MP should be scrubbed with 2% chlorhexidine for at least 5 seconds; if alcohol 70% is used the length of friction should not be inferior to 10 seconds.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f61000317e","authors":["Conti, Adriana","Katzap, Roberta Monteiro","Poli-de-Figueiredo, Carlos Eduardo","Pagnussatti, Vany","Figueiredo, Ana Elizabeth","Poli\u2010de\u2010Figueiredo, Carlos Eduardo"],"doi":"10.1111\/nep.13101","first_seen_on":"2017-07-14T10:25:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1320-5358","1440-1797"],"journal":"Nephrology","last_mentioned_on":1501971521,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28703892?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nep.13101\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nep.13101\/pdf","pmid":"28703892","pubdate":"2017-07-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Disinfection of the Peritoneal Dialysis Bag Medication Port: Comparison of Disinfectant Agent and Disinfection Time","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8324953,"mean":7.0165383958894,"rank":6317391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1127121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8324953,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222352,"mean":12.281494358019,"rank":158060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":40022,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222352,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":369,"mean":2.0909130434783,"rank":205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":369,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.840625,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/A_baumannii\/statuses\/885806479583846400","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21883441],"posted_on":"2017-07-14T10:21:36+00:00","author":{"name":"A. baumannii","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/789866501184585728\/5gMV-dsG_normal.jpg","description":"bot that pushes A. baumannii pubs from PubMed","id_on_source":"A_baumannii","tweeter_id":"789292797044064256","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":16},"tweet_id":"885806479583846400"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/set_fortess\/statuses\/893959471336226816","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21883441],"posted_on":"2017-08-05T22:18:41+00:00","author":{"name":"soda_troubles","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/711632574343421952\/_Wb_UpPy_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"set_fortess","tweeter_id":"1106903606","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":466},"tweet_id":"893959471336226816"}]}}
