In this study, Sarcocystis spp. samples were isolated from Bandicota indica, Rattus argentiventer, R. tiomanicus and R. norvegicus across five provinces of Thailand. Two major groups of Sarcocystis cysts were determined in this study: large and small cysts. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses based on the partial sequences of 28S ribosomal DNA, the large cysts showed that the highest identity value (99%) with the S. zamani in GenBank database. While the small cysts could be divided into 2 groups of Sarcocystis: S. singaporensis and presupposed S. zuoi. The further analysis on 18S rDNA supported that the 2 isolates (S2 and B6 no.2) were as identified as S. singaporensis shared a high sequence identity with the S. singaporensis in GenBank database and the unidentified Sarcocystis (4 isolates, i.e., B6 no.10, B6 no.12, B10 no.4 and B10 no.7) showed 96.3-99.5% identity to S. zuoi as well as high distinct identity from others Sarcocystis spp. (<93%). The result indicated that these four samples should be S. zuoi. In this study, we provided complete sequence of internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), 5.8S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) of these three Sarcocystis species and our new primer set could be useful to study the evolution of Sarcocystis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f1f","authors":["WATTHANAKAIWAN, Vichan","SUKMAK, Manakorn","HAMARIT, Kriengsak","KAOLIM, Nongnid","WAJJWALKU, Worawidh","MUANGKRAM, Yuttamol"],"doi":"10.1292\/jvms.16-0086","first_seen_on":"2017-07-14T12:36:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0916-7250","1347-7439"],"journal":"Journal of Veterinary Medical Science","last_mentioned_on":1500031203,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28701623?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28701623","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Japanese Society of Veterinary Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Molecular characterization of the ribosomal DNA unit of <i>Sarcocystis singaporensis<\/i>, <i>Sarcocystis zamani<\/i> and <i>Sarcocystis zuoi<\/i> from rodents in Thailand","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8208212,"mean":6.9507561304097,"rank":6232639,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1105291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8208212,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178965,"mean":11.460346024899,"rank":126576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":33003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178965,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1553,"mean":1.0715631443299,"rank":657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1553,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.4892857142857,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jvms_japan\/statuses\/885821189364490241","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21886535],"posted_on":"2017-07-14T11:20:03+00:00","author":{"name":"jvms_japan","url":"http:\/\/jsvetsci.jp\/jvms\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1898235853\/twitter-icon_normal.gif","id_on_source":"jvms_japan","tweeter_id":"524151017","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":35},"tweet_id":"885821189364490241"}]}}
