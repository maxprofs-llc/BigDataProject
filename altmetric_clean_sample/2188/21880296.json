Ab$"],"citation":{"abstract":"This article argues that the mid-1960s saw a dramatic shift in how 'brainwashing' was popularly imagined, reflecting Anglo-American developments in the sciences of mind as well as shifts in mass media culture. The 1965 British film The Ipcress File (dir. Sidney J. Furie, starr. Michael Caine) provides a rich case for exploring these interconnections between mind control, mind science and media, as it exemplifies the era's innovations for depicting 'brainwashing' on screen: the film's protagonist is subjected to flashing lights and electronic music, pulsating to the 'rhythm of brainwaves'. This article describes the making of The Ipcress File's brainwashing sequence and shows how its quest for cinematic spectacle drew on developments in cybernetic science, multimedia design and modernist architecture (developments that were also influencing the 1960s psychedelic counter-culture). I argue that often interposed between the disparate endeavours of 1960s mind control, psychological science and media was a vision of the human mind as a 'cybernetic spectator': a subject who scrutinizes how media and other demands on her sensory perception can affect consciousness, and seeks to consciously participate in this mental conditioning and guide its effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4dd3cf058f610001bf6","authors":["Marcia Holmes"],"doi":"10.1177\/0952695117703295","first_seen_on":"2017-07-14T08:40:58+00:00","funders":["niehs","wellcome"],"handles":[],"issns":["0952-6951","1461-720X"],"issue":"3","journal":"History of the Human Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1503320944,"links":["http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/eprint\/jsPRv9bpyfcSf7hbChJH\/full","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/0952695117703295","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/0952695117703295","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5528197\/"],"pmcid":"PMC5528197","pmid":"28781433","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE PublicationsSage UK: London, England","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"},{"name":"History And Philosophy Of Specific Fields","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Arts and Humanities"],"startpage":"3","title":"Brainwashing the cybernetic spectator: The Ipcress File, 1960s cinematic spectacle and the sciences of mind","type":"article","volume":"30"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.55,"score_history":{"1y":12.55,"6m":12.55,"3m":12.55,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":693048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7715293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229716,"mean":12.916876338071,"rank":31335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":198313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229716,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260,"mean":5.485861003861,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":4.9875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":12,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":12,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":10,"CA":1,"US":1,"DE":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/matthewcobb\/statuses\/885807705277026305","license":"gnip","rt":["HPersuaders"],"citation_ids":[21880296],"posted_on":"2017-07-14T10:26:29+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"matthewcobb","tweeter_id":"1524781","geo":{"lt":53.48095,"ln":-2.23743,"country":"GB"}},"tweet_id":"885807705277026305"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPersuaders\/statuses\/885781094813118464","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21880296],"posted_on":"2017-07-14T08:40:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Hidden Persuaders","url":"http:\/\/www.bbk.ac.uk\/hiddenpersuaders\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/572379006847053824\/jTnTKDUT_normal.png","description":"Hidden Persuaders: Brainwashing, Culture, Clinical Knowledge and the Cold War Human Sciences, funded by the Wellcome Trust and based at Birkbeck","id_on_source":"HPersuaders","tweeter_id":"3065938371","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":528},"tweet_id":"885781094813118464"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SarahVMarks\/statuses\/885806057599246336","license":"gnip","rt":["HPersuaders"],"citation_ids":[21880296],"posted_on":"2017-07-14T10:19:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Sarah Marks","url":"http:\/\/www.bbk.ac.uk\/history\/our-staff\/post-doctoral-research-assistants\/dr-sarah-marks","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/903913523205550080\/8X_H7Phz_normal.jpg","description":"Historian of the psy-professions & Central & Eastern Europe, @HPersuaders project at Birkbeck, University of London.","id_on_source":"SarahVMarks","tweeter_id":"104877781","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":604},"tweet_id":"885806057599246336"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HistHum\/statuses\/885810561824555009","license":"gnip","rt":["HPersuaders"],"citation_ids":[21880296],"posted_on":"2017-07-14T10:37:50+00:00","author":{"name":"History Human Sci","url":"http:\/\/hhs.sagepub.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/482505418397077504\/T0EzG-gN_normal.jpeg","description":"History of the Human Sciences Journal @Sage_News: expanding our understanding of the human.
