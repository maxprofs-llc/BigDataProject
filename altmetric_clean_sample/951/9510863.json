Understanding how rDNA transcription is coupled to the availability of growth factors and nutrients will provide insight into how ribosome biogenesis is maintained in a tumour environment characterised by limiting nutrients. We demonstrate that modulation of rDNA transcription initiation, elongation and rRNA processing is an immediate, co-regulated response to altered amino acid abundance, dependent on both mTORC1 activation of S6K1 and MYC activity. Growth factors regulate rDNA transcription initiation while amino acids modulate growth factor-dependent rDNA transcription by primarily regulating S6K1-dependent rDNA transcription elongation and processing. Thus, we show for the first time amino acids regulate rRNA synthesis by a distinct, post-initiation mechanism, providing a novel model for integrated control of ribosome biogenesis that has implications for understanding how this process is dysregulated in cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Kang, Jian","Kusnadi, Eric P","Ogden, Allison J","Hicks, Rodney J","Bammert, Lukas","Kutay, Ulrike","Hung, Sandy","Sanij, Elaine","Hannan, Ross D","Hannan, Katherine M","Pearson, Richard B","Jian Kang","Eric P.
