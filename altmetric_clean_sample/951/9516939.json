The cytotoxic factor was purified from culture supernatant of SEPEC 15 (serogroup O153) by liquid chromatography process. PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) showed that the purified SEPEC cytotoxic factor had a molecular mass of \u223c150kDa and consisted of at least two subunits. At the concentration of 1 CD50 (40\u03bcg\/mL) did facilitate transcytosis through the HUVEC cells monolayer of SEPEC 15 as much as E. coli K12 within 30min without affecting cell viability. These results suggest that this cytotoxic factor, named as SPF (SEPEC's permeabilizing factor), may be an important SEPEC virulence factor that facilitates bacterial access to the bloodstream.","authors":["Tibo, Luiz Henrique Soares","Bertol, J\u00e9ssica Wildgrube","Bernedo-Navarro, Robert Alvin","Yano, Tomomasa"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bjid.2016.01.003","endpage":"302","first_seen_on":"2016-07-08T20:10:09+00:00","issns":["1678-4391","14138670"],"issue":"3","journal":"The Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1467989675,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1413867016300356"],"pmid":"26963151","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"298","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Cytotoxic factor secreted by Escherichia coli associated with sepsis facilitates transcytosis through human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cytotoxic-factor-secreted-escherichia-coli-associated-sepsis-facilitates-transcytosis-through-human"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/zecabac\/statuses\/751429279666274304","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9516939],"posted_on":"2016-07-08T14:54:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Jose Carlos","url":"http:\/\/www.crbiodigital.com.br\/02\/josecarlos","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1126842019\/Imagem_008_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"zecabac","tweeter_id":"45351424","geo":{"lt":-10,"ln":-55,"country":"BR"},"followers":94},"tweet_id":"751429279666274304"}]}}
