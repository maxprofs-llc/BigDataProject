Beyond the historic context of research misconduct, little is known about the associations of social ecologic factors with mistrust and of mistrust with SCD clinical trials enrollment. This study evaluated proximal (age, gender, disease severity, perceived stress, SES) and distal (religious beliefs, social support, instrumental support) factors related to mistrust of research among caregivers of children with SCD and adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with SCD.\nOver an 18-month period (2009-2010), participants completed questionnaires of perceived barriers and benefits to clinical trials enrollment, perceived stress, and self-reported demographic and disease-related information. Analyses (January-June 2015) used multivariable linear regressions to evaluate predictors of mistrust.\nData were analyzed for 154 caregivers (mean age, 38.75 years; SD=9.56 years; 90.30% female) and 88 AYAs (mean age, 24.76 years; SD=7.25 years; 46.40% female). Among caregivers (full model, R(2)=0.14, p\u22640.001), greater mistrust was explained by higher perceived stress (\u03b2=0.04, p=0.052); religious beliefs (\u03b2=0.61, p\u22640.001); and greater instrumental support (\u03b2=0.07, p=0.044). Among AYAs (full model, R(2)=0.18, p\u22640.001), higher mistrust was explained by being male (\u03b2=-0.56, p\u22640.001) and lower instrumental support (\u03b2=-0.11, p=0.016). Mistrust was significantly greater among caregivers that reported no prior involvement in medical research (p=0.003).\nBy understanding the complexity through which social ecologic factors contribute to mistrust, researchers may create targeted strategies to address mistrust and increase engagement in SCD research for caregivers and AYAs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002215","authors":["Stevens, Evelyn M","Patterson, Chavis A","Li, Yimei B","Smith-Whitley, Kim","Barakat, Lamia P"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amepre.2016.01.024","endpage":"S86","first_seen_on":"2016-07-08T19:56:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2607","07493797"],"issue":"1 Suppl 1","journal":"American Journal of Preventive Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1467842269,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0749379716000507"],"pmcid":"PMC4916926","pmid":"27320470","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"S78","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Mistrust of Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease Clinical Trials Research","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mistrust-pediatric-sickle-cell-disease-clinical-trials-research"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002981,"mean":6.7515998143141,"rank":6924529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002981,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259394,"mean":11.494839051169,"rank":217983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259394,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2654,"mean":22.036744063325,"rank":2576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2654,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":25.743076923077,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Mistrust of Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease Clinical Trials Research - American Journal of...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=621309778028651&id=110379855788315","license":"public","citation_ids":[9516467],"posted_on":"2016-07-06T21:57:49+00:00","summary":"Related to our last post: a study on patients and caregivers and the level of mistrust of #sicklecelldisease clinical trials","author":{"name":"California Sickle Cell Resources","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/110379855788315","facebook_wall_name":"California Sickle Cell Resources","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/110379855788315\/picture","id_on_source":"110379855788315"}}]}}
