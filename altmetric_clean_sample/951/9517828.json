Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured in 2010, 2011 and 2012 to capture changes in glycaemic control postdisaster. Age, sex, urban\/rural residency, evacuation status and medication use were also assessed.\nThere was an overall deterioration in glycaemic control after the disaster, with the mean HbA1c rising from 6.77% in 2010 to 6.90% in 2012 (National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program, NGSP). Rural residency was associated with a lower likelihood of deteriorating control (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.84), compared with urban residency. Older age (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.98) was also slightly protective against increased HbA1c. Evacuation and sex were not significant predictors.\nPatients with diabetes who were affected by Japan's triple disaster experienced a deterioration in their glycaemic control following the disasters. The extent of this deterioration was mediated by sociodemographic factors, with rural residence and older age protective against the effects of the disaster on glycaemic control. These results may be indicative of underlying social determinants of health in rural Japan.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Claire Leppold","Masaharu Tsubokura","Akihiko Ozaki","Shuhei Nomura","Yuki Shimada","Tomohiro Morita","Sae Ochi","Tetsuya Tanimoto","Masahiro Kami","Yukio Kanazawa","Tomoyoshi Oikawa","Sarah Hill","Leppold, Claire","Tsubokura, Masaharu","Ozaki, Akihiko","Nomura, Shuhei","Shimada, Yuki","Morita, Tomohiro","Ochi, Sae","Tanimoto, Tetsuya","Kami, Masahiro","Kanazawa, Yukio","Oikawa, Tomoyoshi","Hill, Sarah"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-011455","first_seen_on":"2016-07-08T20:31:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"7","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1469118662,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/7\/e011455.full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27388360?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-011455","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/7\/e011455"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/7\/e011455.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4947778","pmid":"27388360","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","startpage":"e011455","title":"Sociodemographic patterning of long-term diabetes mellitus control following Japan's 3.11 triple disaster: a retrospective cohort study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/lookup\/doi\/10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-011455","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sociodemographic-patterning-longterm-diabetes-mellitus-control-following-japans-311-triple-disaster"},"altmetric_score":{"score":36.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":36.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088508,"mean":6.8823654995833,"rank":237496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":7850941,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088508,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259879,"mean":11.586190112283,"rank":13911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":245950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259879,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5852,"mean":16.920499743634,"rank":481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":5371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5852,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":374,"mean":22.525935656836,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":374,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
