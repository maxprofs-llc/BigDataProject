Although fast and accurate computational prediction of binding affinities for an arbitrary molecule is still beyond the limits of current methods, the docking and screening procedures can select small sets of likely lead candidates from large libraries of either commercially or synthetically available compounds.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a1","authors":["Ruben Abagyan","Maxim Totrov"],"doi":"10.1016\/s1367-5931(00)00217-9","endpage":"382","first_seen_on":"2016-12-25T05:19:05+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["13675931","1367-5931"],"issue":"4","journal":"Current Opinion in Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1136073600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S1367-5931(00)00217-9"],"pmid":"11470599","pubdate":"2001-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"375","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"High-throughput docking for lead generation","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1367593100002179","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highthroughput-docking-lead-generation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6869880,"mean":6.1799092216886,"rank":1597224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4508835,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6869880,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94096,"mean":11.052997311228,"rank":27875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":64838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94096,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":679,"mean":2.565802359882,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":679,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.925,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
