The leukotriene modifying agents currently used to control bronchoconstriction and inflammation in asthmatic patients are CYSLTR1-specific leukotriene receptor antagonists. In this report, we investigated a possible role for therapeutic modulation of CYSLTR2 in asthma by investigating genetic association with asthma and further characterization of the pharmacology of a coding polymorphism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032dd","authors":["Sreekumar G Pillai","Diane J Cousens","Ashley A Barnes","Peter T Buckley","Mathias N Chiano","Louise K Hosking","Lee-Ann Cameron","Mary E Fling","James J Foley","Andrew Green","Henry M Sarau","Dulcie B Schmidt","Catherine S Sprankle","Malcolm N Blumenthal","Jorgen Vestbo","Karen Kennedy-Wilson","William E Wixted","Michael J Wagner","Wayne H Anderson","Diane M Ignar"],"doi":"10.1097\/00008571-200409000-00007","endpage":"633","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T00:27:27+00:00","issns":["0960-314X"],"issue":"9","journal":"Pharmacogenetics","last_mentioned_on":1196580875,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/00008571-200409000-00007"],"pmid":"15475736","pubdate":"2004-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"627","subjects":["geneticsmedical","pharmacology"],"title":"A coding polymorphism in the CYSLT2 receptor with reduced affinity to LTD4 is associated with asthma","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/content.wkhealth.com\/linkback\/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&an=00008571-200409000-00007","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coding-polymorphism-cyslt2-receptor-reduced-affinity-ltd4-associated-asthma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4681163,"mean":5.6987966927893,"rank":1130517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2962078,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4681163,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164714,"mean":9.0188014910786,"rank":49202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":113316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164714,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146,"mean":3.1734344827586,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
