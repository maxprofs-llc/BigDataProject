The cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding a hydrophobic protein of 599 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 67022 Da. Hydropathy analysis revealed twelve potential transmembrane segments. The human protein is highly homologous to the protein from rat brain. Northern hybridization demonstrated a ubiquitous distribution of the transporter in various parts of the brain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b7","authors":["H Nelson","S Mandiyan","N Nelson"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T02:39:40+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0014-5793"],"issue":"1","journal":"Febs Letters","last_mentioned_on":1198023891,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2387399"],"pmid":"2387399","pubdate":"1990-08-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Cloning of the human brain GABA transporter.","type":"article","volume":"269","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cloning-human-brain-gaba-transporter-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629479,"mean":4.9344089205159,"rank":816482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629479,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95369,"mean":8.189974561698,"rank":24783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95369,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3393,"mean":2.6190831367925,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3393,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.3653846153846,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
