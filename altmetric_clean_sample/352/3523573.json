Recently, three susceptibility genes have been identified in HSCR, namely the RET protooncogene, the endothelin B (ETB) receptor gene (EDNRB), and the endothelin-3 (ET-3) gene (EDN3). To investigate whether mutations in EDNRB could be related with HSCR in non-inbred populations in Japan, we examined alterations of the gene in 31 isolated patients. Three novel mutations were detected as follows: two transversions, A to T and C to A at nucleotides 311 (N104I) and 1170 (S390R), respectively, and a transition, T to C at nucleotide 325 (C109R). To analyze functions of these mutant receptors, they were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. S390R mutation did not change the binding affinities but caused the decreases in the ligand-induced increment of intracellular calcium and in the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, showing the impairment of the intracellular signaling. C109R receptors were proved to be localized near the nuclei as an unusual 44-kDa protein with the extremely low affinity to endothelin-1 (ET-1) and not to be translocated into the plasma membrane. On the other hand, N104I receptors showed almost the same binding affinities and functional properties as those of the wild type. Therefore, we conclude that S390R and C109R mutations could cause HSCR but that N104I mutation might be polymorphous.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Hirokazu Tanaka","Kayoko Moroi","Jun Iwai","Hideyo Takahashi","Naomi Ohnuma","Seiji Hori","Misato Takimoto","Mariko Nishiyama","Tomoh Masaki","Masashi Yanagisawa","Souei Sekiya","Sadao Kimura"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.273.18.11378","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T00:04:18+00:00","issns":["1083-351X","0021-9258"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1257162497,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.273.18.11378","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9556633"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/273\/18\/11378.full.pdf","pmid":"9556633","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Novel mutations of the endothelin B receptor gene in patients with Hirschsprung's disease and their characterization.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-mutations-endothelin-b-receptor-gene-patients-hirschsprungs-disease-characterization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635033,"mean":4.9228440290343,"rank":816745,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635033,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96339,"mean":8.261496792543,"rank":25243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69989,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96339,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28045,"mean":2.6354659107117,"rank":1751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":9971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28045,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":2.4358842975207,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Endothelin receptor type B","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=323455044#altmetric_citation_24","license":"public","citation_ids":[3523573],"posted_on":"2009-11-02T11:48:17+00:00","summary":"Endothelin receptor type B, also known as ETB is a protein that in humans is encoded by the EDNRB gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14416795","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Boghog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Boghog"}}]}}
