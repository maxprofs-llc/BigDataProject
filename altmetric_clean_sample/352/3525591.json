Among the various useful methodologies for the introduction of fluorine into organic molecules, electrophilic fluorination is a promising and exciting area of research. While a variety of electrophilic fluorinating reagents are available, currently 1-chloromethyl-4-fluoro-1,4-diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane bis(tetrafluoroborate) (Selectfluor) provides a remarkably straightforward and effective route. The breadth of applications realizable from this reagent in its role as a key electrophilic fluorinating reagent is highlighted here. This Account covers the literature for electrophilic fluorination reactions that employ Selectfluor during the period January 1999-January 2003.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000213f","authors":["Rajendra P.
