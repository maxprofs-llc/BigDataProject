Purification steps included: ammonium sulfate fractionation, S-Sepharose, chelating Sepharose, concanavalin A Sepharose, and Superose 12 chromatography. The native protein was monomeric with a molecular mass of 56 kilodaltons as estimated by analytical gel filtration. The enzyme displayed a broad pH optimum of about pH 5.6 and was relatively heat stable. Western blots of microgram quantities of the final preparation showed no cross-reactivity when probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies prepared against either castor bean endosperm cytosolic pyruvate kinase, or sorghum leaf phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. The final preparation exhibited a broad substrate selectivity, showing high activity toward p-nitrophenyl phosphate, adenosine diphosphate, adenosine triphosphate, gluconate 6-phosphate, and phosphoenolpyruvate, and moderate activity toward several other organic phosphates. Phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase possessed at least a fivefold and sixfold greater affinity and specificity constant, respectively, for phosphoenolpyruvate (apparent Michaelis constant = 50 micromolar) than for any other nonartificial substrate. The enzyme was activated 1.7-fold by 4 millimolar magnesium, but was strongly inhibited by molybdate, fluoride, zinc, copper, iron, and lead ions, as well as by orthophosphate, ascorbate, glutamate, aspartate, and various organic phosphate compounds. It is postulated that phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase functions to bypass the adenosine diphosphate dependent pyruvate kinase reaction during extended periods of orthophosphate starvation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333b","authors":["Stephen M.
