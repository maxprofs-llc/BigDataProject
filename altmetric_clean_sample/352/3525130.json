The only clue to the function of PH domains is the circumstantial evidence that they may link beta gamma subunits of G proteins to second messenger systems. Knowledge of the three-dimensional structures of PH domains should help to elucidate the roles they play in the proteins that contain them.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002660","authors":["A K Downing","P C Driscoll","I Gout","K Salim","M J Zvelebil","M D Waterfield"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T00:40:33+00:00","issns":["0960-9822"],"issue":"10","journal":"Current Biology","last_mentioned_on":1197231229,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7850421"],"pmid":"7850421","pubdate":"1994-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Three-dimensional solution structure of the pleckstrin homology domain from dynamin.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/threedimensional-solution-structure-pleckstrin-homology-domain-dynamin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3620975,"mean":4.9297103293237,"rank":815887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2281465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3620975,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93814,"mean":7.3243947214139,"rank":23827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93814,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4852,"mean":15.739331271903,"rank":1915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":2089,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4852,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":42.092285714286,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
