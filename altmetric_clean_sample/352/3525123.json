The underlying mechanism is paradoxical contraction of the anal sphincter or puborectalis muscle. However, paradoxical sphincter contraction (PSC) also occurs in healthy controls, so anismus may be diagnosed too often because it may be based on a non-specific finding related to untoward conditions during the anorectal examination.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002997","authors":["W A Voderholzer","D A Neuhaus","A G Klauser","K Tzavella","S A M\u00fcller-Lissner","N E Schindlbeck"],"doi":"10.1136\/gut.41.2.258","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T00:40:14+00:00","issns":["1468-3288","0017-5749"],"journal":"Gut","last_mentioned_on":1351465173,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/gut.41.2.258","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9301508","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1891465","http:\/\/gut.bmj.com\/cgi\/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9301508"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/gut.bmj.com\/content\/41\/2\/258.full.pdf","pmid":"9301508","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Paradoxical sphincter contraction is rarely indicative of anismus","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/paradoxical-sphincter-contraction-rarely-indicative-anismus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632901,"mean":4.9227823810231,"rank":815898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632901,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95945,"mean":8.2333832235473,"rank":25048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69794,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95945,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1867,"mean":4.4704201500536,"rank":501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1867,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":6.8119117647059,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":8,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1,"ZA":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Defecography","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=520337867#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3525123],"posted_on":"2012-10-28T22:59:33+00:00","summary":"Defecography (also known as proctography, defecating\/defecation proctography, evacuating\/evacuation proctography or dynamic rectal examination) is a type of medical radiological imaging in which the mechanics of a patient's defecation are visualized in rea","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14629325","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Lesion","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Lesion"}},{"title":"Anismus","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=226269313#altmetric_citation_7","license":"public","citation_ids":[3525123],"posted_on":"2008-07-17T16:40:50+00:00","summary":"Anismus (or dyssynergic defecation) refers to the failure of the normal relaxation of pelvic floor muscles during attempted defecation.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=36805698","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Una Smith","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Una Smith"}}]}}
