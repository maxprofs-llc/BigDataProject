LST-1 is a new gene family located between the organic anion transporter family and prostaglandin transporter. LST-1 transports taurocholate (Km = 13.6 microM) in a sodium-independent manner. LST-1 also shows broad substrate specificity. It transports conjugated steroids (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, estradiol-17beta-glucuronide, and estrone-3-sulfate), eicosanoids (prostaglandin E2, thromboxane B2, leukotriene C4, leukotriene E4), and thyroid hormones (thyroxine, Km = 3.0 microM and triiodothyronine, Km = 2.7 microM), reflecting hepatic multispecificity. LST-1 is probably the most important transporter in human liver for clearance of bile acids and organic anions because hepatic levels of another organic anion transporter, OATP, is very low. This is also the first report of the human molecule that transports thyroid hormones.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Takaaki Abe","Masayuki Kakyo","Taro Tokui","Rie Nakagomi","Toshiyuki Nishio","Daisuke Nakai","Hideki Nomura","Michiaki Unno","Masanori Suzuki","Takeshi Naitoh","Seiki Matsuno","Hiromu Yawo"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.274.24.17159","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T02:07:26+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1083-351X","0021-9258"],"issue":"24","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1197986056,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.274.24.17159","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10358072"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/274\/24\/17159.full.pdf","pmid":"10358072","pubdate":"1999-06-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Identification of a novel gene family encoding human liver-specific organic anion transporter LST-1.","type":"article","volume":"274","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-novel-gene-family-encoding-human-liverspecific-organic-anion-transporter-lst1-8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622268,"mean":4.9302137127912,"rank":816582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2284714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622268,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94375,"mean":7.5222405747346,"rank":24052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":69235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94375,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28038,"mean":2.6479229589471,"rank":1753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":9954,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28038,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239,"mean":2.1331260504202,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
