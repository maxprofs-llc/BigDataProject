This enzyme hydrolyzed taurine-conjugated bile acids but showed no activity toward glycine conjugates. Among the taurine conjugates, taurochenodeoxycholic acid was most effectively hydrolyzed, tauro-beta-muricholic and ursodeoxycholic acids were moderately well hydrolyzed, and cholic and 7 beta-cholic acids were hardly hydrolyzed, suggesting that this enzyme has a specificity for not only the amino acid moiety but also the steroidal moiety. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be approximately 140,000 by Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration and the subunit molecular weight of the enzyme was 36,000 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The optimum pH was in the range of 5.6 to 6.4. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme was Met-Glu-Arg-Thr-Ile-Thr-Ile-Gln-Gln-Ile-Lys-Asp-Ala-Ala-Gln. The enzyme was activated by dithiothreitol, but inhibited by sulfhydryl inhibitors, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, N-ethylmaleimide, and dithiodipyridine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f81","authors":["K Kawamoto","I Horibe","K Uchida"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T00:24:19+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0021-924X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1196456733,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2628421"],"pmid":"2628421","pubdate":"1989-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Purification and characterization of a new hydrolase for conjugated bile acids, chenodeoxycholyltaurine hydrolase, from Bacteroides vulgatus.","type":"article","volume":"106","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/purification-characterization-new-hydrolase-conjugated-bile-acids-chenodeoxycholyltaurine-hydrolase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3617832,"mean":4.9275495826122,"rank":815384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2278765,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3617832,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93349,"mean":7.2249570853152,"rank":23666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93349,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":649,"mean":2.4431604938272,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":649,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.88636363636364,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
