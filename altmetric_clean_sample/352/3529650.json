The primary structure of bovine PI-G PLD has now been determined and the functional activity of the enzyme has been studied. Expression of PI-G PLD complementary DNA in COS cells produced a protein that specifically hydrolyzed the inositol phosphate linkage of the PI-G anchor. Cotransfection of PI-G PLD with a PI-G-anchored protein resulted in the secretion of the PI-G-anchored protein. The results suggest that the expression of PI-G PLD may influence the expression and location of PI-G-anchored proteins.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1991Sci...252..446S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["BJ Scallon","WJ Fung","TC Tsang","S Li","H Kado-Fong","KS Huang","JP Kochan"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.2017684","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T02:44:25+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1095-9203","0036-8075"],"issue":"5004","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1198020317,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.2017684","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2017684"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/252\/5004\/446.full.pdf","pmid":"2017684","pubdate":"1991-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Primary structure and functional activity of a phosphatidylinositol-glycan-specific phospholipase D.","type":"article","volume":"252","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/primary-structure-functional-activity-phosphatidylinositolglycanspecific-phospholipase-d"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628824,"mean":4.9380564480592,"rank":816727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628824,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95293,"mean":8.1763844603956,"rank":24749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95293,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27894,"mean":21.010855841968,"rank":15050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":7287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27894,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":532,"mean":90.302915254237,"rank":463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":532,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
