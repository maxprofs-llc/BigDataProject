Some nitroalkanes have been demonstrated to be carcinogenic, and enzymatic oxidation of nitroalkanes is of considerable interest. 2-Nitropropane dioxygenases from Neurospora crassa and Williopsis mrakii (Hansenula mrakii), members of one family of the nitroalkane-oxidizing enzymes, contain FMN and FAD, respectively. The enzymatic oxidation of nitroalkanes by 2-nitropropane dioxygenase operates by an oxidase-style catalytic mechanism, which was recently shown to involve the formation of an anionic flavin semiquinone. This represents a unique case in which an anionic flavin semiquinone has been experimentally observed in the catalytic pathway for oxidation catalyzed by a flavin-dependent enzyme. Here we report the first crystal structure of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in two forms: a binary complex with FMN and a ternary complex with both FMN and 2-nitropropane. The structure identifies His(152) as the proposed catalytic base, thus providing a structural framework for a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Jun Yong Ha","Ji Young Min","Su Kyung Lee","Hyoun Sook Kim","Do Jin Kim","Kyoung Hoon Kim","Hyung Ho Lee","Hye Kyung Kim","Hye-Jin Yoon","Se Won Suh"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m601658200","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T23:15:24+00:00","issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1359325097,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M601658200","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16682407"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/281\/27\/18660.full.pdf","pmid":"16682407","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Crystal structure of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase complexed with FMN and substrate.
