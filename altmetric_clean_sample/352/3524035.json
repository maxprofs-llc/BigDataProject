(1990) Biochemistry 29, 2057-2065) into liposomes rendered transport properties of this enzyme clear. The liposomes were prepared by the reversed-phase method using egg lecithin and cholesterol in a molar ratio of 2:1 and the purified ATPase was incorporated into the liposomes by a dialysis for 3 h. About 80% of the ATPase was incorporated into the liposomes. The weight ratio of the enzyme to lipid was 1:400-600. A sigmoid curve was obtained when the Cl(-)-transport activity of the enzyme was plotted against Cl- concentration. Hill's plot afforded a half-substrate concentration [S]0.5 of 45 mM and a Hill's coefficient n of 2.33. Effects of Br- and F- on the Cl(-)-transport were also examined in the reconstituted system, both halide ions decreased the 36Cl- efflux significantly. These kinetic data are in good agreement with the electrophysiological data presented by Tittor et al. ((1983) J. Membr. Biol. 75, 129-139).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["T Ohhashi","T Katsu","M Ikeda"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T00:14:21+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0006-3002"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1196116235,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1533790"],"pmid":"1533790","pubdate":"1992-04-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Improvement of reconstitution of the Cl(-)-translocating ATPase isolated from Acetabularia acetabulum into liposomes and several anion pump characteristics.","type":"article","volume":"1106","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improvement-reconstitution-cltranslocating-atpase-isolated-acetabularia-acetabulum-liposomes-several"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626769,"mean":4.9522514062143,"rank":817865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626769,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94754,"mean":8.1100137409898,"rank":24530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94754,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3852,"mean":2.5431711243833,"rank":254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3852,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":0.92409523809524,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Cl-transporting ATPase","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=173997110#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3524033,3524035],"posted_on":"2007-11-26T22:30:35+00:00","summary":"The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, H2O, and Cl&minus;, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and Cl&minus;.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14440413","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"WillowW","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:WillowW"}}]}}
