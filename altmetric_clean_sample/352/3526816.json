Recently, KiSS-1 was cloned as a human metastasis suppressor gene, and an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor (hOT7T175) was identified as the endogenous receptor of the KiSS-1 product. However, the clinical importance of KiSS-1 and hOT7T175 gene expression in ESCC remains unclear.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efa","authors":["Masahide Ikeguchi","Ken-ichi Yamaguchi","Nobuaki Kaibara"],"doi":"10.1158\/1078-0432.ccr-1519-02","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T01:22:42+00:00","issns":["1557-3265"],"journal":"Clinical Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1196593370,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1158\/1078-0432.CCR-1519-02","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14977840"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/10\/4\/1379.full.pdf","pmid":"14977840","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Clinical significance of the loss of KiSS-1 and orphan G-protein-coupled receptor (hOT7T175) gene expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-significance-loss-kiss1-orphan-gproteincoupled-receptor-hot7t175-gene-expression-esophageal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627074,"mean":4.9506160212417,"rank":817770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627074,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94843,"mean":8.1148690031843,"rank":24576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94843,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3398,"mean":3.9493676773624,"rank":965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3398,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":9.2673333333333,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
