High-resolution x-ray structures of the GTP gamma S and GDP.AlF4- complexes formed by the G protein Gi alpha 1 demonstrate specific roles in transition-state stabilization for two highly conserved residues. Glutamine204 (Gln61 in p21ras) stabilizes and orients the hydrolytic water in the trigonal-bipyramidal transition state. Arginine 178 stabilizes the negative charge at the equatorial oxygen atoms of the pentacoordinate phosphate intermediate. Conserved only in the G alpha family, this residue may account for the higher hydrolytic rate of G alpha proteins relative to those of the p21ras family members. The fold of Gi alpha 1 differs from that of the homologous Gt alpha subunit in the conformation of a helix-loop sequence located in the alpha-helical domain that is characteristic of these proteins; this site may participate in effector binding. The amino-terminal 33 residues are disordered in GTP gamma S-Gi alpha 1, suggesting a mechanism that may promote release of the beta gamma subunit complex when the alpha subunit is activated by GTP.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1994Sci...265.1405C","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["DE Coleman","AM Berghuis","E Lee","ME Linder","AG Gilman","Sprang"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.8073283","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T00:48:11+00:00","issns":["1095-9203","0036-8075"],"journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1294086621,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.8073283","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8073283"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/265\/5177\/1405.full.pdf","pmid":"8073283","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Structures of active conformations of Gi alpha 1 and the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structures-active-conformations-gia1-mechanism-gtp-hydrolysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4617414,"mean":5.4160956271844,"rank":1073425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2973115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4617414,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157165,"mean":8.9885254129445,"rank":46416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":108761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157165,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30883,"mean":25.211681821126,"rank":17069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":8108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30883,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":565,"mean":102.40095744681,"rank":497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":565,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
