Common polymorphisms in the latter have been found, in some studies, to be related to coronary heart disease (CHD) but the PRR2 gene has not been studied in this context. Here, we examined relationships between a PRR2 Sau96I (A\/G) polymorphism, the epsilon2, 3 and 4 alleles of APOE and CHD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cde","authors":["Elizabeth M Freitas","Tony C A Phan","Carly E Herbison","Frank T Christiansen","Roger R Taylor","Frank M Van Bockxmeer"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T23:57:19+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1350-6277"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Cardiovascular Risk","last_mentioned_on":1195630893,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11984219"],"pmid":"11984219","pubdate":"2002-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"The poliovirus receptor related 2 (PRR2) and apolipoprotein E genes and coronary heart disease.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/poliovirus-receptor-related-2-prr2-apolipoprotein-e-genes-coronary-heart-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630815,"mean":4.9285062716012,"rank":816167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630815,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95698,"mean":8.2091561072972,"rank":24937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95698,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":4.76,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
