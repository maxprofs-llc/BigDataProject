In our present study, we found that IBD patients exhibited much higher serum FCN-2 levels than healthy controls. In the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis mouse model, FCN-A knockout mice showed much milder disease symptoms with less histological damage, lower expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1)), chemokines (CXCL1\/2\/10 and CCL4) and higher levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 compared to WT mice. We demonstrated that FCN-A\/2 exacerbated the inflammatory pathogenesis of IBD by stimulating M1 polarization through the TLR4\/MyD88\/MAPK\/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in macrophages. Thus, our data suggest FCN-A\/2 may be used as a novel therapeutic target for IBD. This article is protected by copyright.
