A plethora of research has been conducted to unravel the composition and dynamics of microbial consortia associated with Chinese traditional fermented foods using culture-dependent as well as culture-independent methods, like different high-throughput sequencing (HTS) techniques. These HTS techniques enable us to understand the relationship between a food product and its microbes to a greater extent than ever before. Considering the importance of Chinese traditional fermented products, the objective of this paper is to review the diversity and dynamics of microbiota in Chinese traditional fermented foods revealed by HTS approaches.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f34","authors":["He, Guo-Qing","Liu, Tong-Jie","Sadiq, Faizan A","Gu, Jing-Si","Zhang, Guo-Hua"],"doi":"10.1631\/jzus.b1600148","first_seen_on":"2017-04-06T10:07:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1862-1783"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Zhejiang University - Science B","last_mentioned_on":1491473172,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28378567?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28378567","pubdate":"2017-04-06T22:05:36+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Insights into the microbial diversity and community dynamics of Chinese traditional fermented foods from using high-throughput sequencing approaches.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/insights-microbial-diversity-community-dynamics-chinese-traditional-fermented-foods-using-highthroug"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":6914535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234693,"mean":12.835627588499,"rank":191737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234693,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255,"mean":5.4217480314961,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.585,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
