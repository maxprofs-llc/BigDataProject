This is currently delivered though a large number of regional diabetic eye screening programmes that are responsible for identifying eligible children and young people, and inviting them to a screening appointment (Fig.\u00a01). In 2014\/2015, the National Paediatric Diabetes Audit, based on secondary (hospital-based) care data for over 27\u00a0600 children, revealed that only 64% of eligible children and young people in England had been recorded as having undergone diabetic retinopathy screening during the last audit year; of whom, 13% were reported to have at least background diabetic retinopathy [2].
