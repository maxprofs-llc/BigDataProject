Methods Six healthy spayed female domestic cats were sedated using one of two ketamine-containing protocols: intramuscular xylazine hydrochloride (1 mg\/kg) plus ketamine hydrochloride (3 mg\/kg) (XK), and dexmedetomidine hydrochloride (5 \u00b5g\/kg) plus ketamine hydrochloride (3 mg\/kg) (DK). A short ERG protocol was recorded from the left eye of each cat under XK and DK sedation. Thirty minutes later, the effects were reversed with yohimbine or atipamezole for the XK and DK treatment, respectively. The cats were evaluated for time to recumbency, time to head elevation, and time to standing position after reversal treatments. Other variables recorded were: systolic blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, heart rate, pulse oximetry and respiratory rate. Recorded ERG variables included a- and b-wave amplitudes and implicit times under photopic, scotopic and scotopic mixed ERG conditions. Results Time to lateral recumbency with XK was shorter than for DK ( P <0.05). After reversal, head elevation and standing position times were significantly longer for the XK than the DK group ( P <0.05). Heart rate increased and systolic blood pressure decreased from baseline in both groups ( P <0.05), but there were no significant differences between treatment groups. The b-wave amplitude recorded in the photopic study of cats treated with XK was lower than in animals treated with DK ( P <0.05). No other significant differences in ERG variables were observed between treatment groups ( P >0.05). Conclusions and relevance The present study shows that XK and DK treatments are chemical restraint alternatives for ERG recording in cats, with only significant differences in the photopic b-wave amplitude.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c7f","authors":["Del Sole, Mar\u00eda J","Nejamkin, Pablo","Cavilla, Ver\u00f3nica","Schaiquevich, Paula","Moreno, Laura","Mar\u00eda J Del Sole","Pablo Nejamkin","Ver\u00f3nica Cavilla","Paula Schaiquevich","Laura Moreno"],"doi":"10.1177\/1098612x17703011","first_seen_on":"2017-04-06T10:00:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-612X","1532-2750"],"journal":"Journal of Feline Medicine & Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1491910090,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28379112?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+PubmedcatsmeshOr+%28pubmed%3A+%28%22cats%22%5Bmesh%5D%29+or+%28+...%29","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/1098612X17703011"],"pmid":"28379112","pubdate":"2017-04-06T22:04:13+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Comparison of two sedation protocols for short electroretinography in cats","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-two-sedation-protocols-short-electroretinography-cats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8058252,"mean":6.8390091159945,"rank":5835264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1937279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8058252,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236031,"mean":12.946501605728,"rank":154171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":68053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236031,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":947,"mean":3.7819725158562,"rank":400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":947,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":9.5866666666667,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/re_Pets\/statuses\/849924734590611456","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18549341],"posted_on":"2017-04-06T10:00:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Chaplin","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BelkaPriscilla","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/567022568893579264\/FY8qdBcy_normal.jpeg","description":"mustachioed lady cat who lets  Belka, the tangerine pomeranian tweet when she sleeps!","id_on_source":"re_Pets","tweeter_id":"172817327","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":91},"tweet_id":"849924734590611456"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Albinovet\/statuses\/851758769566601217","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18549341],"posted_on":"2017-04-11T11:28:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefano Cattaneo DVM","url":"http:\/\/veterinarialbino.com\/\/twitter_en.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1673372763\/vet_tweet_normal.png","description":"Daily updates about pet health covering the last articles published in veterinary journals.","id_on_source":"Albinovet","tweeter_id":"418669767","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2106},"tweet_id":"851758769566601217"}]}}
