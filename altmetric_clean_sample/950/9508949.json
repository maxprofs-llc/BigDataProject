Both POC PT and POC aPTT showed concordance with the laboratory PT and aPTT. Lot-to-lot variation was below 2% both for POC PT and for POC aPTT. The mean relative difference of capillary blood compared to venous blood was 0.2 % with POC PT and 8.4% with POC aPTT. The coefficients of variation for repeatability of POC PT using whole blood were found to be between 2% and 3.6%.\nOur findings suggest reliable quantitative results with this POC system to support on-site decision-making for patients with suspected deficiencies of coagulation factors in acute and intensive care.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b66","authors":["Niederd\u00f6ckl, J","Dempfle, C-E","Sch\u00f6nherr, H-R","Bartsch, A","Miles, G","Laggner, A","Pathil, A"],"doi":"10.1111\/ijlh.12519","first_seen_on":"2016-07-08T16:57:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1751-553X"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Laboratory Hematology","last_mentioned_on":1467972542,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27384253?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27384253","pubdate":"2016-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Point-of-care PT and aPTT in patients with suspected deficiencies of coagulation factors","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pointofcare-pt-aptt-patients-suspected-deficiencies-coagulation-factors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029085,"mean":6.8046097213542,"rank":4232052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2234434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029085,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259565,"mean":11.542585189009,"rank":141249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":92527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259565,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":1.8001194029851,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.1583333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
