The key to this high regioselectivity is the appropriate choice of the N-P(O)tBu2 directing group and the use of diaryliodonium triflate salts as the coupling partners in the presence of catalytic CuO. The protocol is distinguished by mild reaction system that avoids ligand and additives, exhibiting wide scope of indole and arene coupling components without compromising its efficiency and scalability, thus representing a significant advancement in the implementation of regioselective direct arylation of indoles.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Youqing Yang"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.6b05777","first_seen_on":"2016-07-08T16:23:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5126","0002-7863"],"issue":"28","journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1468343461,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.6b05777"],"pmid":"27362919","pubdate":"2016-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Cu-Catalyzed Direct C6-Arylation of Indoles","type":"article","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cucatalyzed-direct-c6arylation-indoles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069135,"mean":6.8476973499224,"rank":3794217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4095981,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069135,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259696,"mean":11.580517853636,"rank":118644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":132681,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259696,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18809,"mean":5.243302105487,"rank":11760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":6666,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18809,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":485,"mean":9.3380330578512,"rank":268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":485,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
