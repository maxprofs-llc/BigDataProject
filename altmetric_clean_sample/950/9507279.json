For regenerated cellulose, complete (13)C assignments of the other carbon regions have not previously been attainable, due to signal overlap. In this study, two-dimensional (2D) NMR correlation methods were used to resolve and assign (13)C signals for all carbon atoms in regenerated cellulose. (13)C-enriched bacterial nanocellulose was biosynthesized, dissolved, and coagulated as highly crystalline cellulose II. Specifically, four distinct (13)C signals were observed corresponding to conformationally different anhydroglucose units: two signals assigned to crystalline moieties and two signals assigned to non-crystalline species. The C1, C4 and C6 regions for cellulose II were fully examined by global spectral deconvolution, which yielded qualitative trends of the relative populations of the different cellulose moieties, as a function of wetting and drying treatments.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024a4","authors":["Idstr\u00f6m, Alexander","Schantz, Staffan","Sundberg, Johan","Chmelka, Bradley F.","Gatenholm, Paul","Nordstierna, Lars"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.carbpol.2016.05.107","endpage":"487","first_seen_on":"2016-07-08T16:48:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01448617","1879-1344"],"journal":"Carbohydrate Polymers","last_mentioned_on":1467972069,"links":["http:\/\/publications.lib.chalmers.se\/publication\/239194-13c-nmr-assignments-of-regenerated-cellulose-from-solid-state-2d-nmr-spectroscopy"],"pmid":"27474592","pubdate":"2016-07-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"480","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"13C NMR assignments of regenerated cellulose from solid-state 2D NMR spectroscopy","type":"article","volume":"151","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/13c-nmr-assignments-regenerated-cellulose-solidstate-2d-nmr-spectroscopy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029085,"mean":6.8046097213542,"rank":6949522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029085,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259565,"mean":11.542586152163,"rank":218102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259565,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":886,"mean":1.4902011299435,"rank":530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":886,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":0.71617647058824,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
