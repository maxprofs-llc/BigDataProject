In this study, the anti-apoptotic actions of 19e were evaluated in INS-1 pancreatic beta-cells co-treated with TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 to induce cell death. Compound 19e protected INS-1 cells from cytokine-induced cell death, and the effect was similar to treatment with another GKA or exendin-4. Compound 19e reduced annexin-V stained cells and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase protein, as well as upregulated the expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 protein. Compound 19e inhibited apoptotic signaling via induction of the ATP content, and the effect was correlated with the downregulation of nuclear factor-\u03baB p65 and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Further, 19e increased NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) deacetylase activity, and the anti-apoptotic effect of 19e was attenuated by SIRT1 inhibitor or SIRT1 siRNA treatment. Our results demonstrate that the novel GKA, 19e, prevents cytokine-induced beta-cell apoptosis via SIRT1 activation and has potential as a therapeutic drug for the preservation of pancreatic beta-cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc18","authors":["Oh, Yoon Sin","Seo, Eunhui","Park, Kaapjoo","Jun, Hee-Sook"],"doi":"10.3389\/fphar.2017.00169","first_seen_on":"2017-03-29T22:29:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1663-9812"],"journal":"Frontiers in Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1490828261,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphar.2017.00169\/full?utm_source=S-TWT&utm_medium=SNET&utm_campaign=ECO_FPHAR_XXXXXXXX_auto-dlvrit%0A"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphar.2017.00169\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC5370240","pmid":"28405188","pubdate":"2017-03-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Compound 19e, a Novel Glucokinase Activator, Protects against Cytokine-Induced Beta-Cell Apoptosis in INS-1 Cells","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/i-v-o-r-l-n-o-l-65"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":6094275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2033715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249022,"mean":13.237518313716,"rank":163945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":70417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249022,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2079,"mean":3.4752136669875,"rank":846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":1100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2079,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192,"mean":2.5047853403141,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
