At least 21 proteins, when absent or defective, have been implicated in this disorder, and they together constitute the FA pathway, which functions in detection and repair of, and tolerance to, endogenous DNA damage. The damage primarily handled by the FA pathway has been assumed to be related to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). The FA pathway is activated upon ICL damage, and a hallmark of this activation is the mono-ubiquitination events of the key FANCD2-FANCI protein complex. Recent data have revealed unexpectedly complex details in the regulation of FA pathway activation by ICLs. In this short review, we summarize the knowledge accumulated over the years regarding how the FA pathway is activated via protein modifications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000821b","authors":["Masamichi Ishiai","Koichi Sato","Junya Tomida","Hiroyuki Kitao","Hitoshi Kurumizaka","Minoru Takata"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mrfmmm.2017.05.003","first_seen_on":"2017-05-11T01:29:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00275107","1873-135X"],"journal":"Mutation Research\/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis","last_mentioned_on":1494517552,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0027510717300787"],"pmid":"28552166","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Activation of the FA pathway mediated by phosphorylation and ubiquitination","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/activation-fa-pathway-mediated-phosphorylation-ubiquitination"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187776,"mean":6.9233436649085,"rank":3857711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4147759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187776,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237813,"mean":12.389862210485,"rank":110683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":119871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237813,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1482,"mean":3.9701796083727,"rank":1161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1482,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.59,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
