Seed coat colour change from brown-red to yellow was observed in a mutant line (142-3) of B. distachyon, which was induced by chronic gamma radiation. In addition, dwarf phenotypes were observed in each of the lines 142-3, 421-2, and 1376-1. In order to identify causal mutations for the seed coat colour change, the three mutant lines and the wild type were subjected to whole-genome re-sequencing. After removing natural variations, 906, 1057, and 978 DNA polymorphisms were detected in 142-3, 421-2, and 1376-1, respectively. A total of 13 high-risk DNA polymorphisms were identified in mutant 142-3. Based on a comparison with DNA polymorphisms in 421-2 and 1376-1, candidate causal mutations for the seed coat colour change in 142-3 were selected. In the two independent A. thaliana lines carrying T-DNA insertions in the AtCHI, seed colour change was observed. We propose a frameshift mutation in BdCHI1 as a causal mutation responsible for seed colour change in 142-3. The DNA polymorphism information for these mutant lines can be utilized for functional genomics in B. distachyon and cereal crops.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000c44","authors":[" Man Bo Lee"," Dae Yeon Kim"," Yong Weon Seo"],"doi":"10.1139\/gen-2016-0145","first_seen_on":"2017-05-11T00:03:11+00:00","issns":["0831-2796","1480-3321"],"journal":"Genome","last_mentioned_on":1494245980,"links":["http:\/\/www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/full\/10.1139\/gen-2016-0145?src=recsys#.WRBhyPkrJaQ"],"pmid":"28319670","publisher":" NRC Research Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural Biotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Identification of candidate genes for the seed coat colour change in a Brachypodium distachyon mutant induced by gamma radiation using whole-genome re-sequencing","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172683,"mean":6.9158600214652,"rank":7072706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172683,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237065,"mean":12.375299083792,"rank":192645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237065,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":536,"mean":2.8280598130841,"rank":368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":536,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.1888333333333,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Identification of candidate genes for the seed coat colour change in a Brachypodium distachyon mutant induced by gamma radiation using whole-genome re-sequencing - Genome","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1463237370366221&id=278050538884916","license":"public","citation_ids":[20030315],"posted_on":"2017-05-08T12:19:40+00:00","summary":"A paper from Korea University.\n\n\"We propose a #frameshift #mutation in BdCHI1 as a causal mutation responsible for seed colour change in 142-3.
