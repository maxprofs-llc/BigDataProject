Male Wistar rats were gavaged with A4, mulberry leaf extract (ME), fermented mulberry leaf extract (FME), or lafutidine (LAF) for 10 days and injected intraperitoneally with 5-FU (150 mg kg(-1) ) or saline (normal control) on day 7 to induce mucositis. After euthanizing the animals, their small and large intestines were removed for evaluation of histopathologic parameters, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, mucin content, and mRNA expression of the mucin gene and pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2. 5-FU induced significant weight loss, shortened villi height, and increased histological severity, IL-1\u03b2 expression, and MPO activity compared to the normal control group. These pathological changes were markedly ameliorated by treatment with A4, ME, and FME. These treatments also stimulated MUC2 and MUC5AC gene expression and mucin production, and reduced IL-1\u03b2 expression and MPO level. Interestingly, FME had the greatest protective effect on 5-FU-induced mucositis in rats. This article is protected by copyright.
