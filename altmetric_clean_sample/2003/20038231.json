The present study aimed to evaluate its performance in dogs undergoing surgery. Thirty dogs admitted for elective surgeries, were anaesthetised with a standardised protocol. PTA, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and HDR (defined as an increase by >20% in HR and\/or SBP within 5min) were assessed at the following predefined time-points: TStSt (steady-state, after induction of anaesthesia and before start of surgery), TClamp (clamping of surgical drapes on the skin), TCut (cutaneous incision), TPrePTA (retrospectively assessed 1min before a PTA decline of at least 20%) and TEndIso (isoflurane discontinuation). The dynamic variation of PTA over 1min (\u2206PTA) was calculated at each predefined time-points and its performance to predict HDR was assessed by building Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves. A significant decrease of PTA (p<0.002) was detected 1min after TClamp, TCut and TPrePTA followed by a significant increase in HR and\/or SBP within 5min after the time points (p<0.01). The \u0394PTA was associated with the following performance in predicting HDR: AUC ROC [95% CI]=0.80 [0.71 to 0.88] (p<0.05), with a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 72% for a threshold value of -18%. Although encouraging, the performance of the PTA index and its dynamic variation needs to be further evaluated, particularly in different clinical contexts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f61000346b","authors":["Mansour, Christelle","Merlin, Tristan","Bonnet-Garin, Jeanne-Marie","Chaaya, Rana","Mocci, Rita","Ruiz, Clara Conde","Allaouchiche, Bernard","Boselli, Emmanuel","Junot, St\u00e9phane"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.rvsc.2017.05.009","first_seen_on":"2017-05-11T10:15:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0034-5288","00345288","1532-2661"],"journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","last_mentioned_on":1494497672,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S003452881730084X?dgcid=raven_sd_aip_email"],"pmid":"28575801","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Evaluation of the Parasympathetic Tone Activity (PTA) index to assess the analgesia\/nociception balance in anaesthetised dogs","type":"article","volume":"115","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-parasympathetic-tone-activity-pta-index-assess-analgesianociception-balance-anaesthetised"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187659,"mean":6.9230329122133,"rank":7085772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187659,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237811,"mean":12.39000446575,"rank":193426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237811,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":793,"mean":1.4718914141414,"rank":484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":793,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":2.5604166666667,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":3,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Albinovet\/statuses\/862611875749662724","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20038231],"posted_on":"2017-05-11T10:14:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefano Cattaneo DVM","url":"http:\/\/veterinarialbino.com\/\/twitter_en.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1673372763\/vet_tweet_normal.png","description":"Daily updates about pet health covering the last articles published in veterinary journals.","id_on_source":"Albinovet","tweeter_id":"418669767","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2113},"tweet_id":"862611875749662724"}]}}
