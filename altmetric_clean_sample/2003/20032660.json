To improve efficacy, videos have been used prior to the simulation of practical procedures; however, using videos prior to simulation training concerning the management of patients who are unwell has not been investigated. The aim of this project was to see whether clinical decision-making and non-technical skills can be improved if a video is used prior to simulation training, and uniquely to enhance the authenticity we filmed it using a first-person perspective.\nWe conducted a randomised controlled trial with 40 final-year medical students randomised into two groups. One group viewed a video filmed in first person prior to a simulation scenario, whereas the other group did not view the video. The two groups then carried out the simulation and were assessed with 'time to' investigation and treatment decisions. Further quantitative data were collected for non-technical skills using the Ottawa Crisis Resource Management (OCRM) score. Qualitative data were collected from the students as to the perceived ease of use and helpfulness of the video. Simulation training is increasingly being used as part of the undergraduate medical curriculum RESULTS: The students who watched the video appeared to perform better in clinical decision-making and non-technical skills. The students were extremely receptive to the use of a first-person perspective video, and highlighted its perceived realism and its help as a memory aid.\nThe use of this style of video was warmly received by students and opens the possibility of further use to enhance simulation training.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5213cf058f610003aa3","authors":["Fukuta, Junaid","Morgan, Justin"],"doi":"10.1111\/tct.12659","first_seen_on":"2017-05-11T02:47:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1743-498X","17434971"],"journal":"Clinical Teacher","last_mentioned_on":1503572456,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/tct.12659\/abstract;jsessionid=828773019BE0B0EFE127596A1788C102.f04t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/tct.12659\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/tct.12659\/pdf","pmid":"28493407","pubdate":"2017-05-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["education"],"title":"First\u2010person perspective video to enhance simulation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/firstperson-perspective-video-enhance-simulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":2,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":3662414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4639552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248906,"mean":12.564441799079,"rank":102358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":142514,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248906,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":427,"mean":4.6310798122066,"rank":219,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":427,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":3.815625,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CL":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Astralus\/statuses\/862499281734819840","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20032660],"posted_on":"2017-05-11T02:47:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Ricardo Romero","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2210059184\/YO_normal.jpg","description":"Pregunte.","id_on_source":"Astralus","tweeter_id":"69451511","geo":{"lt":-33.45694,"ln":-70.64827,"country":"CL"},"followers":106},"tweet_id":"862499281734819840"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ZoeSchnepp\/statuses\/900674279381114883","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20032660],"posted_on":"2017-08-24T11:00:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Zoe Schnepp","url":"http:\/\/schneppgroup.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3367202476\/ed73ce8c55f10c9d87795ee659c5396a_normal.png","description":"Scientist.
