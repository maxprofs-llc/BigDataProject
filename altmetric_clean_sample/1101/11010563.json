Six collegiate track and field throwers (3 hammer, 2 discus, 1 javelin) trained for 12 weeks using a block-periodization model culminating with a one week overreach followed by a 3 week taper (ORT). Session rating of perceived exertion training load (RPETL) and strength training volume-load times bar displacement (VLd) were recorded weekly. Athletes were tested pre- and post-ORT on measures of vastus lateralis architecture, unloaded and loaded squat and countermovement jump performance, underhand and overhead throwing performance, and competition throwing performance. There was a statistical reduction in weight training VLd\/session (d=1.21, p<0.05) and RPETL\/session (d=0.9, p<0.05) between the in-season and ORT training phases. Five of six athletes improved overhead throw and competition throwing performance following the ORT (d=0.50, p<0.05). Vastus lateralis muscle thickness statistically increased following the in-season training phase (d=0.28, p<0.05), but did not change following the ORT. Unloaded countermovement jump peak force and relative peak power improved significantly following the ORT (d=0.59, p<0.05, d=0.31, p<0.05, respectively). These findings demonstrate that an overreaching week followed by a 3-week taper is an effective means of improving explosive ability and throwing performance in collegiate track and field throwers despite the absence of detectable changes in muscle architecture.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040e2","authors":["Bazyler, Caleb D.","Mizuguchi, Satoshi","Harrison, Alex P.","Sato, Kimitake","Kavanaugh, Ashley A.","DeWeese, Brad H.","Stone, Michael H.","Bazyler, Caleb D","Harrison, Alex P","Kavanaugh, Ashley A","DeWeese, Brad H","Stone, Michael H"],"doi":"10.1519\/jsc.0000000000001619","first_seen_on":"2016-09-02T13:02:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1533-4287","1064-8011"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research","last_mentioned_on":1506276512,"links":["http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/_layouts\/15\/oaks.journals.mobile\/articleviewer.aspx?year=9000&issue=00000&article=96320#ath","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27575250?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Fulltext\/2017\/10000\/Changes_in_Muscle_Architecture,_Explosive_Ability,.17.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/9000\/00000\/Changes_in_Muscle_Architecture,_Explosive_Ability,.96320.pdf","pmid":"27575250","pubdate":"2016-08-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Changes in Muscle Architecture, Explosive Ability, and Track and Field Throwing Performance Throughout a Competitive Season and Following a Taper","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Changes_in_Muscle_Architecture,_Explosive_Ability,.96320.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/changes-muscle-architecture-explosive-ability-track-field-throwing-performance-throughout-competitiv"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.15,"score_history":{"1y":6.75,"6m":6.75,"3m":6.75,"1m":5.9,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.15},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":721639,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7734881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253097,"mean":12.536813367259,"rank":33210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":219821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253097,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3923,"mean":16.277452320245,"rank":1333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":2588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3923,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":11.395223300971,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":11,"researcher":7},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":7,"Members of the public":11}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Sports and Recreations":6,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":8,"AU":2,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrTSuchomel\/statuses\/771714937555193856","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11010563],"posted_on":"2016-09-02T14:22:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Tim Suchomel","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Timothy_Suchomel","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/677143785994780672\/JPepvZIL_normal.jpg","description":"PhD in Sport Physiology and Performance, Assistant Professor in the Department of Human Movement Sciences at Carroll University","id_on_source":"DrTSuchomel","tweeter_id":"172117465","geo":{"lt":43.01168,"ln":-88.23148,"country":"US"},"followers":2597},"tweet_id":"771714937555193856"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CLU_CPE\/statuses\/771722975825375233","license":"gnip","rt":["DrMikeStone"],"citation_ids":[11010563],"posted_on":"2016-09-02T14:54:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Cal Lutheran CPE","url":"http:\/\/www.cluports.com\/cpe","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/895067856286564352\/s2iF8KW9_normal.jpg","description":"Cal Lutheran Center for Performance","id_on_source":"CLU_CPE","tweeter_id":"520673269","geo":{"lt":34.17056,"ln":-118.83759,"country":"US"},"followers":307},"tweet_id":"771722975825375233"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Doc_Haff\/statuses\/771795999299952640","license":"gnip","rt":["DrTSuchomel"],"citation_ids":[11010563],"posted_on":"2016-09-02T19:44:40+00:00","author":{"name":"G.
