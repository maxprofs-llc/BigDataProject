Health professionals lack adequate educational resources to manage smoking. Resources need to be tailored to ensure saliency, cultural-sensitivity and account for diversity of Indigenous populations. As part of an intervention to improve health professionals' smoking cessation care in Aboriginal pregnant women, a resource package was developed collaboratively with two Aboriginal Medical Services. The purpose of this study was to assess and validate this resource package. A multi-centred community-based participatory 4-step process (with three Aboriginal Medical Services from three Australian states), included: (1) Scientific review by an expert panel (2) 'Suitability of Materials' scoring by two Aboriginal Health Workers (3) Readability scores (4) Focus groups with health professionals. Content was analysed using six pre-determined themes (attraction, comprehension, self-efficacy, graphics and layout, cultural acceptability, and persuasion), with further inductive analysis for emerging themes. Suitability of Material scoring was adequate or superior. Average readability was grade 6.4 for patient resources (range 5.1-7.2), and 9.8 for health provider resources (range 8.5-10.6). Emergent themes included 'Getting the message right'; 'Engaging with family'; 'Needing visual aids'; and 'Requiring practicality under a tight timeframe'. Results were presented back to a Stakeholder and Consumer Aboriginal Advisory Panel and resources were adjusted accordingly. This process ensured materials used for the intervention were culturally responsive, evidence-based and useful. This novel formative evaluation protocol could be adapted for other Indigenous and culturally diverse interventions. The added value of this time-consuming and costly process is yet to be justified in research, and might impact the potential adaption by other projects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f6100078a4","authors":["Yael Bar-Zeev","Michelle Bovill","Billie Bonevski","Maree Gruppetta","Jennifer Reath"," The ICAN QUIT in Pregnancy Pilot Group","Gillian Gould"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijerph14101148","first_seen_on":"2017-10-01T03:42:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1660-4601"],"issue":"10","journal":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1507005791,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/14\/10\/1148"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/14\/10\/1148\/pdf","pmid":"28961160","pubdate":"2017-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Assessing and Validating an Educational Resource Package for Health Professionals to Improve Smoking Cessation Care in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Pregnant Women","type":"article","volume":"14"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.9,"score_history":{"1y":5.9,"6m":5.9,"3m":5.9,"1m":5.9,"1w":5.9,"6d":5.9,"5d":5.9,"4d":5.9,"3d":5.9,"2d":5.9,"1d":4.2,"at":5.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462674,"mean":7.1086773474447,"rank":1496291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6963051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462674,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107387,"mean":11.236770230757,"rank":22328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":84964,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107387,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3288,"mean":7.9972242166109,"rank":664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":2622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3288,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":8.8265565217391,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":99,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":6}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":5,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yaelbarzeev\/statuses\/914334499667881985","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26861744],"posted_on":"2017-10-01T03:41:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Yael Bar-Zeev","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Yael_Bar-Zeev","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/862853539479003137\/re9kDQkc_normal.jpg","description":"Public Health Physician, PhD candidate at @UON_research, interested in smoking cessation in vulnerable populations, inculding Indigenous pregnant mothers","id_on_source":"yaelbarzeev","tweeter_id":"280172745","geo":{"lt":-32.92715,"ln":151.77647,"country":"AU"},"followers":507},"tweet_id":"914334499667881985"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/GillianSGould\/statuses\/914374558286827520","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26861744],"posted_on":"2017-10-01T06:20:57+00:00","author":{"name":"DrGillianGould","url":"https:\/\/www.newcastle.edu.au\/profile\/gillian-gould","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/772987353379975168\/ISheAqC8_normal.jpg","description":"GP Researcher\/A\/Prof @UON_research @SISTAQUIT focusing on smoking cessation for Indigenous mothers who smoke during pregnancy.
