We examined the risk of rehospitalization in the first year postpartum among deliveries to women with and without SMM.\nWe used the Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal data system, in which vital birth\/fetal death records were linked with hospital delivery discharge data and subsequent nondelivery hospitalization data, including observational stays (OSs) and in-patient stays (hospital discharge [HD]) for Massachusetts residents during 2002-2011. We excluded deliveries to women with preexisting chronic conditions: hypertension, diabetes, asthma, and autoimmune conditions for a final sample of 685,228 deliveries. Multivariable log binomial regression with generalized estimating equations modeled the relative risk (RR) of hospital encounters 6 weeks and 1 year postpartum.\nThe rate of SMM was 99 per 10,000 deliveries. In the first year postpartum, 2.8% of deliveries to women without chronic medical conditions experienced at least one HD encounter and 1.0% at least one OS encounter. The adjusted relative risk (aRR) of any HD encounter for deliveries with SMM was 2.48 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.20-2.80) within 6 weeks postpartum and 2.04 (95% CI: 1.87-2.23) within 1 year. For OS encounters, aRRs among deliveries with SMM at delivery were 2.47 (95% CI: 1.94-3.14) in the first 6 weeks and 1.69 (95% CI: 1.43-2.01) in 1 year.\nIn Massachusetts, SMM increased the risk of rehospitalization in the first year postpartum among deliveries to women without chronic medical conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fa2","authors":["HarveyElizabeth M.","AhmedSaifuddin","ManningSusan E.","DiopHafsatou","ArganiCynthia","StrobinoDonna M."],"doi":"10.1089\/jwh.2017.6437","first_seen_on":"2017-10-01T05:05:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1540-9996","1931-843X"],"journal":"Journal of Women's Health (15409996)","last_mentioned_on":1507035834,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/10.1089\/jwh.2017.6437?utm_content=buffer7e94c&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"28953424","publisher":" Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.  140 Huguenot Street, 3rd Floor New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA  ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gynecology"],"title":"Severe Maternal Morbidity at Delivery and Risk of Hospital Encounters Within 6 Weeks and 1 Year Postpartum","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.3,"score_history":{"1y":8.3,"6m":8.3,"3m":8.3,"1m":8.3,"1w":8.3,"6d":8.3,"5d":8.3,"4d":8.3,"3d":8.3,"2d":7.45,"1d":5.6,"at":8.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8464917,"mean":7.1091894537326,"rank":1091701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7371260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8464917,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108386,"mean":11.233206495364,"rank":18061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":90273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108386,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":920,"mean":13.118826985854,"rank":231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":920,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":7.3214285714286,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1,"US":4,"NP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/emilywj\/statuses\/914406509290967040","license":"gnip","rt":["MHTF"],"citation_ids":[26863794],"posted_on":"2017-10-01T08:27:55+00:00","author":{"name":"EmilyWhiteJohansson","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/566279601345667073\/WD18FuyV_normal.jpeg","description":"Focus on maternal & child health in NYC and globally.
