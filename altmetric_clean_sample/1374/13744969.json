Herein, a unique type of biocompatible nanoscale delivery system is fabricated by utilizing a chemotherapeutic drug, paclitaxel (PTX), to induce co-assembly of catalase and human serum albumin (HSA), the latter of which is pre-modified with chlorine e6 (Ce6), forming smart multifunctional HSA-Ce6-Cat-PTX nanoparticles via a rather simple one-step method. Upon intravenous injection, HSA-Ce6-Cat-PTX nanoparticles show high tumor accumulation and efficient intra-tumoral diffusion, likely owning to their changeable sizes that can maintain large initial sizes (~100nm) during blood circulation and transform into small protein-drug complexes (<20nm) within the tumor. Meanwhile, catalase within those nanoparticles could trigger decomposition of endogenic TME H2O2 to generate oxygen in-situ so as to relieve tumor hypoxia. This effect together with PTX-induced intra-tumoral perfusion enhancement is able to dramatically modulate TME to favor the anti-tumor effect in the combined photodynamic\/chemotherapy with HSA-Ce6-Cat-PTX. Thus, our work presents a simple drug-induced self-assembly strategy to fabricate enzyme-loaded therapeutic albumin nanoparticles for synergistic cancer combination therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d37","authors":["Chen, Qian","Chen, Jiawen","Liang, Chao","Feng, Liangzhu","Dong, Ziliang","Song, Xuejiao","Song, Guosheng","Liu, Zhuang","Qian Chen","Jiawen Chen","Chao Liang","Liangzhu Feng","Ziliang Dong","Xuejiao Song","Guosheng Song","Zhuang Liu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jconrel.2016.11.006","first_seen_on":"2016-11-17T12:33:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-4995","01683659"],"journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","last_mentioned_on":1506042110,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0168365916312020?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/authShare\/S0168365916312020\/20170920T105500Z\/1?md5=63ad1fa4fb7556d0573b5c7760d97ac8"],"pmid":"27840167","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Drug-induced co-assembly of albumin\/catalase as smart nano-theranostics for deep intra-tumoral penetration, hypoxia relieve, and synergistic combination therapy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/druginduced-coassembly-albumincatalase-smart-nanotheranostics-deep-intratumoral-penetration-hypoxia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446283,"mean":7.1010682364064,"rank":7298101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446283,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284276,"mean":11.903496452378,"rank":228370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284276,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2835,"mean":2.8070550458716,"rank":1987,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2835,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":3.6818983050847,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
