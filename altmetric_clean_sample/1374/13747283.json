Associations between PA at 17 and 36\u2009weeks (time spent in moderate PA (MPA), vigorous PA (VPA) status and their interaction) and neonatal body composition were addressed by multivariate regression analyses.\nFrom 104 women, 50 (48%) and 16 (18%) performed VPA at 17 and 36\u2009weeks of pregnancy. Performing VPA at either time was associated with a decreased birthweight (BW), while only VPA at 17\u2009weeks decreased neonatal adiposity (fat percentage: -2.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8%, p\u2009=\u20090.003). MPA at 36\u2009weeks was associated with an increased lean mass (2.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u2009g per min day(-1) , p\u2009=\u20090.012). Significant interactions were found for BW and bone mineral content (BMC). MPA at 17\u2009weeks tended to increase BW, but not BMC, in the no VPA strata. By contrast, high levels of MPA (\u2265112\u2009min\u2009d(-1) ) combined with VPA at 17\u2009weeks reduced neonatal BMC and BW compared with no VPA (BMC: -5.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u2009g, p\u2009=\u20090.008, BW: -302.8\u2009\u00b1\u200983.7\u2009g, p\u2009=\u20090.0003). Differences were not significant with low MPA levels.\nExercise intensity modulates neonatal body composition. The long-term significance of a reduced BW, adiposity and BMC with VPA requires further study.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e83","authors":["Bisson, M.","Tremblay, F.","St\u2010Onge, O.","Robitaille, J.","Pronovost, E.","Simonyan, D.","Marc, I."],"doi":"10.1111\/ijpo.12174","endpage":"46","first_seen_on":"2016-11-17T13:13:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2047-6310","20476302"],"issue":"S1","journal":"International Journal of Pediatric Obesity","last_mentioned_on":1505736928,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ijpo.12174\/abstract;jsessionid=DB2E4F181C6AE806A004EBD89040DC51.f01t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ijpo.12174\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ijpo.12174\/abstract;jsessionid=7D499235619DF2CD7F95ED862F04EBF2.f01t02?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+26th+November+2016+from+07:00-11:00+GMT+\/+02:00-06:00+EST+\/+15:00-19:00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ijpo.12174\/full?utm_content=buffera5875&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ijpo.12174\/pdf","pmid":"27863167","pubdate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"38","subjects":["metabolism","pediatrics"],"title":"Influence of maternal physical activity on infant's body composition","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-maternal-physical-activity-infants-body-composition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":2.85,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":3328239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5065641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283341,"mean":11.916103882261,"rank":100640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":180704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283341,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":563,"mean":11.142580071174,"rank":268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":563,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":12.580714285714,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"GB":1,"IE":1,"SE":1},"mendeley":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/michaelgoran\/statuses\/799238994714165252","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13747283],"posted_on":"2016-11-17T13:13:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Michael I Goran, PhD","url":"http:\/\/secondhandsugars.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/873654419413319681\/WUdI26qE_normal.jpg","description":"Scientist working at the interface of nutrition and public health to understand and reduce obesity in children. #SecondhandSugars","id_on_source":"michaelgoran","tweeter_id":"30341231","geo":{"lt":34.05223,"ln":-118.24368,"country":"US"},"followers":2323},"tweet_id":"799238994714165252"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MaritaHennessy\/statuses\/800711293254717441","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13747283],"posted_on":"2016-11-21T14:43:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Marita Hennessy","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Marita_Hennessy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/896056294246952972\/BEWpvdiE_normal.jpg","description":"@SPHeREprogramme PhD Scholar @hbcrg.
