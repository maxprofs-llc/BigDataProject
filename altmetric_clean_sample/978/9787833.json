A mean body mass reduction from 99.70 (Quetelet's Index = 31.6 kg\/m2) to 92.79 kg (Quetelet's Index = 29.2 kg\/m2) was accompanied by a decline in the sum of 8 skinfold thicknesses (triceps, subscapular, biceps, iliac crest, supraspinale, abdominal, front thigh and medial calf) from 51.1 to 36.7 mm. The 4 compartment body composition model indicated that there were reductions of: percent body fat (%BF) from 9.1 to 5.0%, fat free mass (FFM) from 90.60 to 88.14 kg and fat mass (FM) from 9.10 to 4.65 kg. Sixty-four percent of the 6.91 kg loss in body mass therefore came from the FM. The 2 compartment hydrodensitometric model yielded higher %BFs (initial = 11.2; final = 7.1) than the 4 compartment model (initial = 9.1; final = 5.0) which is theoretically more valid because it controls for biological variability in the percentages of water and bone mineral in the FFM. Nevertheless, both models registered decreases of 4.1%BF.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9223cf058f61000d967","authors":["Withers, R T","Noell, C J","Whittingham, N O","Chatterton, B E","Schultz, C G","Keeves, J P"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-17T04:52:18+00:00","handle":"2440\/8661","handles":["2440\/8661"],"issns":["0813-6289"],"issue":"1","journal":"Australian journal of science and medicine in sport","last_mentioned_on":1499252322,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9127683","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9127683"],"pmid":"9127683","pubdate":"1997-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Body composition changes in elite male bodybuilders during preparation for competition.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/body-composition-changes-elite-male-bodybuilders-during-preparation-competition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166903,"mean":6.9134132553505,"rank":2064610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4983949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166903,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236596,"mean":12.339977979247,"rank":77472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":155468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236596,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":8.1144444444444,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
