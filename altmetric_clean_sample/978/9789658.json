However, the advent of multidetector computed tomography and techniques of digital image reconstruction has provided an alternative means of performing angiography, without the risks inherent to invasive angiographic examinations. Therefore, within the field of radiology, there is an ever-increasing demand for deeper knowledge of the anatomy of the regional vasculature and its variations. Variations in the renal vascular system are relatively prevalent in the venous and arterial vessels. For various conditions in which surgical planning is crucial to the success of the procedure, knowledge of this topic is important. The aim of this study was to familiarize the general radiologist with variations in the renal vascular system. To that end, we prepared a pictorial essay comprising multidetector computed tomography images obtained in a series of cases. We show patterns representative of the most common anatomical variations in the arterial blood supply to the kidneys, calling attention to the nomenclature, as well as to the clinical and surgical implications of such variations.","altmetric_jid":"56a768e32a83eeb12a8b4aed","authors":["Carlos Fernando de Mello J\u00fanior","Severino Aires Araujo Neto","Arlindo Monteiro de Carvalho Junior","Rafael Batista Rebou\u00e7as","Gustavo Ramalho Pessoa Negromonte","Carollyne Dantas de Oliveira"],"doi":"10.1590\/0100-3984.2014.0048","endpage":"195","first_seen_on":"2016-07-17T08:04:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0100-3984","1678-7099"],"issue":"3","journal":"Radiologia Brasileira","last_mentioned_on":1468780645,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4938450\/#!po=30.0000"],"pmcid":"PMC4938450","pmid":"27403020","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Colegio Brasileiro De Radiologia","startpage":"190","title":"Multidetector computed tomography angiography of the renal arteries: normal anatomy and its variations","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multidetector-computed-tomography-angiography-renal-arteries-normal-anatomy-variations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082727,"mean":6.8629605662661,"rank":4273997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2243495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082727,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236058,"mean":12.290466006091,"rank":130456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":82354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236058,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206,"mean":1.1221170731707,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":4.9,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Saudi_RadTech\/statuses\/754587580629417984","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9789658],"posted_on":"2016-07-17T08:04:33+00:00","author":{"name":"S-R-T","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3051291079\/6e75e60624e748b5e8bad2c9c25da10d_normal.jpeg","description":"Radiologic technologist ,\r\nShare your knowledge.","id_on_source":"Saudi_RadTech","tweeter_id":"247461501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1921},"tweet_id":"754587580629417984"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Saudi_RadTech\/statuses\/754746847059644416","license":"gnip","rt":["Saudi_RadTech"],"citation_ids":[9789658],"posted_on":"2016-07-17T18:37:25+00:00","author":{"name":"S-R-T","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3051291079\/6e75e60624e748b5e8bad2c9c25da10d_normal.jpeg","description":"Radiologic technologist ,\r\nShare your knowledge.","id_on_source":"Saudi_RadTech","tweeter_id":"247461501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1921},"tweet_id":"754746847059644416"}]}}
