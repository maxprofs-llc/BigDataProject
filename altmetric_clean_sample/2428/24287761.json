However, the association between particular napping characteristics (e.g., frequency, duration and whether naps were intentional) and daytime function is unclear.\nParticipants were 2,739 community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged \u226565 years from the nationally representative National Health and Aging Trends Study. Participants reported napping frequency and duration and whether naps were intentional versus unintentional. Restricted participation in valued activities was measured by self-report.\nAfter adjusting for potential confounders and nighttime sleep duration, those who took intentional and unintentional naps had a greater odds of any valued activity restriction (i.e. \u22651 valued activity restriction), compared to those who rarely\/never napped [unintentional odds ratio (OR)=1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01, 1.79, intentional OR=1.49, 95% CI 1.09, 2.04]. There was no difference between unintentional napping and intentional napping with respect to any valued activity restriction after adjustment for demographics. Compared to participants napping \"some days,\" those napping most days\/every day had a greater odds of any valued activity restriction (OR=1.68, 95% CI 1.30, 2.16). Moreover, each 30-minute increase in average nap duration was associated with a 25% greater odds of any valued activity restriction (OR=1.25, 95% CI 1.10, 1.43).\nOlder adults who took more frequent or longer naps were more likely to report activity restrictions, as were those who took intentional or unintentional naps. Additional longitudinal studies with objective measures of sleep are needed to further our understanding of associations between napping characteristics and daytime dysfunction.","authors":["Owusu, Jocelynn T","Ramsey, Christine M","Tzuang, Marian","Kaufmann, Christopher N","Parisi, Jeanine M","Spira, Adam P"],"doi":"10.1093\/gerona\/glx166","first_seen_on":"2017-08-25T04:53:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1758-535X"],"journal":"The Journals of Gerontology: Series A","last_mentioned_on":1503749823,"links":["https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/biomedgerontology\/article\/doi\/10.1093\/gerona\/glx166\/4093882\/Napping-Characteristics-and-Restricted?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/biomedgerontology\/article-pdf\/doi\/10.1093\/gerona\/glx166\/19602770\/glx166.pdf","pmid":"28958012","pubdate":"2017-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Napping Characteristics and Restricted Participation in Valued Activities among Older Adults","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":2.1,"6m":2.1,"3m":2.1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/humanageing\/statuses\/900944092565127168","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24287761],"posted_on":"2017-08-25T04:53:05+00:00","author":{"name":"TheHumanAgingProject","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/514754202417901569\/7H27ZBby_normal.jpeg","description":"Streaming freshly published papers about aging from all important journals.
