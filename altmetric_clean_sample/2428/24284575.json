In the present study, we present our experience with newly developed rigid \u03b2-tricalcium\u00a0phosphate wedges to treat CCDA to better understand the outcomes of this synthetic bone grafting procedure. A total of 13 feet in 13 patients underwent CCDA with synthetic bone grafts. One male (7.69%) and 12 females (92.31%), with a mean age of 65.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.83 (range 36 to 77) years, were followed up for a mean duration of 32.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.81 (range 18 to 55) months. Successful graft union was postoperatively obtained in 12 of the 13 feet (92.31%). The mean preoperative visual analog scale and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society scale score were 7.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.52 (range 5.4 to 10) and 54.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.72 (range 18 to 75), respectively. These scores improved to 1.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.78 (range 0 to 6.2) and 85.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.38 (range 50 to 97) postoperatively (p\u00a0=\u00a0.001 for both comparisons). On radiographic analysis, the talonavicular coverage angle, first metatarsal talar angle, calcaneal pitch, and heel alignment angle had significantly improved (p\u00a0=\u00a0.001, p\u00a0=\u00a0.028, p\u00a0=\u00a0.006, and p\u00a0=\u00a0.001, respectively). The use of bone graft substitutes in CCDA is a viable treatment option for reconstructing flexible flatfoot deformity. Although good clinical and radiographic outcomes were obtained, our method is even more challenging than conventional methods and should be used with caution. Rigid locking fixation with a long period of protected weightbearing is highly recommended to attain uneventful bone healing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a39","authors":["Kobayashi, Hayato","Kageyama, Yasunori","Shido, Yoji"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.jfas.2017.07.003","first_seen_on":"2017-08-25T02:25:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1067-2516","10672516","1542-2224"],"journal":"Journal of Foot & Ankle Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1503627907,"links":["http:\/\/www.jfas.org\/article\/S1067-2516(17)30450-7\/fulltext?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=gerresdpm"],"pmid":"28843551","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics","generalsurgery"],"title":"Calcaneocuboid Distraction Arthrodesis With Synthetic Bone Grafts: Preliminary Results of an Innovative Bone Grafting Procedure in 13\u00a0Patients","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":6393215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1145056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169870,"mean":12.697295268707,"rank":120456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":30791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169870,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":539,"mean":2.614219330855,"rank":282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":539,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.5612903225806,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/GerresDPM\/statuses\/900906858591920128","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24284575],"posted_on":"2017-08-25T02:25:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Jennifer Gerres, DPM","url":"http:\/\/www.footandankle-usa.com\/provider\/dr-jennifer-gerres\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/716274499704848384\/55jwSatm_normal.jpg","description":"Foot & Ankle Surgeon, @ClevelandClinic & @DesMoinesUniv Grad. #WNBA Doc.
