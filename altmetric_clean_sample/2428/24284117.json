IRAK-M, a member of IRAK family, is a negative regulator in TLR signaling and specifically expresses in monocytes and macrophages. The role of IRAK-M in intracellular growth of M. tb and macrophage polarization was explored, for deeply understanding the pathogenesis of M. tb, the significance of IRAK-M to innate immunity and pathogen-host interaction.\nIRAK-M expression was detected in M. tb infected macrophages and in human lung tissue of pulmonary tuberculosis with immunofluorescence staining, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. IRAK-M knock-down and over-expressing cell strains were constructed and intracellular survival of M. tb was investigated by acid-fast staining and colony forming units. Molecular markers of M1-type (pSTAT1 and iNOS) and M2-type (pSTAT6 and Arg-1) macrophages were detected using Western blot in IRAK-M knockdown U937 cells infected with M. tb H37Rv. U937 cells were stimulated with immunostimulant CpG7909 into M1 status and then infected with M. tb H37Rv. Expression of IRAK-M, IRAK-4 and iNOS was detected with immunofluorescence staining and Western blot, to evaluate the effect of IRAK-M to CpG directed M1-type polarization of macrophages during M. tb infection. Molecules related with macrophage's bactericidal ability such as Hif-1 and phosphorylated ERK1\/2 were detected with immunohistochemistry and Western blot.\nIRAK-M increased in M. tb infected macrophage cells and also in human lung tissue of pulmonary tuberculosis. IRAK-M over-expression resulted in higher bacterial load, while IRAK-M interference resulted in lower bacterial load in M. tb infected cells. During M. tb infection, IRAK-M knockdown induced M1-type, while inhibited M2-type polarization of macrophage. M1-type polarization of U937 cells induced by CpG7909 was inhibited by M. tb infection, which was reversed by IRAK-M knockdown in U937 cells. IRAK-M affected Hif-1 and MAPK signaling cascade during M. tb infection.\nConclusively, IRAK-M might alter the polarity of macrophages, to facilitate intracellular survival of M. tb and affect Th1-type immunity of the host, which is helpful to understanding the pathogenesis of M. tb.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007c8","authors":["Pei Shen","Quan Li","Jilei Ma","Maopeng Tian","Fei Hong","Xinjie Zhai","Jianrong Li","Hanju Huang","Chunwei Shi","Shen, Pei","Li, Quan","Ma, Jilei","Tian, Maopeng","Hong, Fei","Zhai, Xinjie","Li, Jianrong","Huang, Hanju","Shi, Chunwei"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12866-017-1095-2","first_seen_on":"2017-08-25T02:02:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1471-2180"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1503657573,"links":["https:\/\/bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12866-017-1095-2","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28835201?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28835201?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12866-017-1095-2?site=bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28835201","pubdate":"2017-08-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"185","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"IRAK-M alters the polarity of macrophages to facilitate the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n        ","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/irakm-alters-polarity-macrophages-facilitate-survival-mycobacterium-tuberculosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":4499966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2346721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169908,"mean":12.694530243015,"rank":93098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":59821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169908,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1399,"mean":3.1547496423462,"rank":721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1399,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":3.3964864864865,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"VE":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BIOCIENCIA2013\/statuses\/900901032913510400","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24284117],"posted_on":"2017-08-25T02:01:58+00:00","author":{"name":"BIOCIENCIA","url":"http:\/\/musical100fm.com.ve\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000300217090\/9b25d5f581a95fff46afd4d8d0d0aad0_normal.jpeg","description":"Programa radial de enfermedades, avances tecnol\u00f3gicos, eventos cient\u00edficos de inter\u00e9s, noticias, entrevistas","id_on_source":"BIOCIENCIA2013","tweeter_id":"1672141952","geo":{"lt":10.46354,"ln":-64.1775,"country":"VE"},"followers":900},"tweet_id":"900901032913510400"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MycobactPapers\/statuses\/901021455537909761","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24284117],"posted_on":"2017-08-25T10:00:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Mycobacterium Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/719097737984274432\/6xb8SSeZ_normal.jpg","description":"A daily collection of papers relating to Mycobacterium.
