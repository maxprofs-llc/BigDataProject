Several of the currently available approved disease-modifying therapies can slow the rate of whole-brain atrophy at the group level. As such, clinicians may want to use whole-brain volume measurements for clinical decision-making.\nDespite its relevance and face validity, several steps must be taken before whole-brain volume measurements are ready to be incorporated into clinical practice, including the adoption of a standardized MRI protocol for MS, the establishment of a gold-standard image postprocessing software to measure whole-brain volume, and the development of specific statistical methods to translate whole-brain volume measurements into clinically relevant metrics at the individual level. As neurodegeneration becomes the focus of MS research worldwide and the likely target of the next generation of disease-modifying therapies, MRI metrics associated with neurodegeneration will be critically important to monitor disease progression and treatment response at the group and individual levels.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005863","authors":["Azevedo, Christina J","Pelletier, Daniel","Azevedo, Christina J."],"doi":"10.1097\/wco.0000000000000322","first_seen_on":"2016-04-14T10:24:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-6551","1350-7540"],"issue":"3","journal":"Current opinion in neurology.","last_mentioned_on":1462354332,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27070219?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-neurology\/Abstract\/2016\/06000\/Whole_brain_atrophy___ready_for_implementation.7.aspx"],"pmid":"27070219","pubdate":"2016-04-14T22:02:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Whole-brain atrophy: ready for implementation into clinical decision-making in multiple sclerosis?","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-neurology\/Fulltext\/2016\/06000\/Whole_brain_atrophy___ready_for_implementation.7.aspx","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wholebrain-atrophy-ready-implementation-clinical-decisionmaking-multiple-sclerosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7651252,"mean":6.5763358914726,"rank":3473874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4146622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7651252,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271097,"mean":11.376412990232,"rank":122374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":146927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271097,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":658,"mean":2.9867671232877,"rank":313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":658,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":5.084625,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
