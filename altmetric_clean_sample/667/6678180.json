Present a method for comparing brain dose to published data.\nTwo head designs were considered: Beam Modulator (BM) and Agility (AG). 12 patients treated on BM were re-planned with AG. Planning objectives were: minimize brain dose, and satisfy target coverage and organs-at-risk dose constraints. Each of 36 targets was analysed for conformity (CI-Paddick), gradient (GI), and homogeneity index (HI). Total volume (V) and brain-minus-PTV (BMP) receiving 80% (V80\/BMP80) down to 25% (V25\/BMP25) of prescription dose and mean doses were evaluated. System differences were statistically evaluated using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Power-law models and prediction bands for V\/BMP were generated based on BM data.\nThe median CI-Paddick was 0.74 and 0.76 for BM and AG, respectively (p=0.04). The median GI was 5.5 and 6.1 (p<0.01) and for HI was 1.17 and 1.16 for BM and AG respectively (p<0.01). V80\/BMP80 down to V40\/BMP40 were not statistically different between the systems whereas BMP25 was weakly different (p=0.02). AG exhibited a lower mean BMP dose (4.1Gy) than BM (4.6Gy) (p<0.01). Power-law models for V\/BMP showed excellent (R(2)>0.80) agreement for the dose levels studied, and comparable results with published data.\nTreatment plans of equivalent quality were attained with AG compared to BM. Advances in Knowledge: The AG system involves a novel collimation design. The present paper demonstrates equivalent or improved brain dose for complex, multi-target cases using AG versus an older stereotactic system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002453","authors":["Ruschin, Mark","Sahgal, Arjun","Iradji, Sara","Soliman, Hany","Leavens, Claudia","Lee, Young"],"doi":"10.1259\/bjr.20160093","first_seen_on":"2016-04-14T10:53:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1748-880X","0007-1285"],"journal":"British Journal of Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1460629538,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27074624?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27074624","pubdate":"2016-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"20160093","subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Investigation of two linac head designs for treating brain metastases with hypofractionated volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/investigation-two-linear-accelerator-head-designs-treating-brain-metastases-hypofractionated-volumet"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7551260,"mean":6.5206857693492,"rank":6540492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7551260,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269823,"mean":11.3718164716,"rank":227464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269823,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":797,"mean":2.5144974874372,"rank":652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":797,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":3.2612903225806,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
