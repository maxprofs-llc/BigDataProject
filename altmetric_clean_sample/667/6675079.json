Several hibernation programs ensure the establishment and maintenance of this resting growth state. Some of the stationary phase-specific modulations affect the ribosome and its translational activity directly. In stationary phase E. coli we observed the appearance of a 16S rRNA fragmentation event at the tip of helix 6 within the small ribosomal subunit (30S). Stationary phase 30S subunits showed markedly reduced activities in protein biosynthesis. On the other hand, the functional performance of stationary phase large ribosomal subunits (50S) was indistinguishable from particles isolated from exponentially growing cells. Introduction of the 16S rRNA cut in vitro at helix 6 of exponential phase 30S subunits renders them less efficient in protein biosynthesis. This indicates the helix 6 fragmentation is necessary and sufficient to attenuate translational activities of 30S ribosomal subunits. These results suggest that stationary phase-specific cleavage of 16S rRNA within the 30S subunit is an efficient means to reduce global translation activities under non-proliferating growth conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e5c","authors":["Luidalepp, Hannes","Berger, Stefan","Joss, Oliver","Tenson, Tanel","Polacek, Norbert"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jmb.2016.01.033","first_seen_on":"2016-04-14T10:28:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1089-8638","00222836"],"journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1460628604,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27067112?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27067112","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Ribosome shut-down by 16S rRNA fragmentation in stationary phase E. coli","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ribosome-shutdown-16s-rrna-fragmentation-stationaryphase-escherichia-coli"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7551260,"mean":6.5206857693492,"rank":6540471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7551260,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269823,"mean":11.371827960655,"rank":227458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269823,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3830,"mean":3.0904324889005,"rank":3611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3830,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":2.8174054054054,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
