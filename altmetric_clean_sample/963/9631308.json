In this study, we investigated the role of microRNA-322 (miR-322) in regulating hypoxia-induced apoptosis in neonatal murine cardiomyocytes in vitro.\nCardiomyocytes of C57BL\/6J mice were treated with hypoxia condition in vitro. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was measured by TUNEL assay. Gene expression pattern of miR-322 was measured by qRT-PCR. Stable downregulation of miR-322 in cardiomyocytes were achieved by lentiviral transduction, and the effect of miR-322 downregulation on hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis was investigated. Possible regulation of miR-322 on its downstream target gene, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was investigated in cardiomyocytes. BDNF was then genetically silenced by siRNA to evaluate its role in miR-137 mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis protection under hypoxia condition.\nUnder hypoxia condition, significant apoptosis was induced and miR-322 was significantly upregulated in cardiomyocytes in vitro. Through lentiviral transduction, miR-322 was efficiently knocked down in cardiomyocytes. Downregulation of miR-322 protected hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Luciferase assay showed BDNF was the target gene of miR-322. QRT-PCR showed BDNF expression was associated with miR-322 regulation on hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Silencing BDNF in cardiomyocyte through siRNA transfection reversed the protective effect of miR-322 downregulation on hypoxia-induced apoptosis.\nOur study revealed that miR-322, in association with BDNF, played important role in regulating hypoxia-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocyte.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbc5","authors":["Yang, Liguo","Song, Shigang","Lv, Hang"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-12T16:22:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1943-8141"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Translational Research","last_mentioned_on":1468340707,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27398164?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4931175","pmid":"27398164","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"MicroRNA-322 protects hypoxia-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes via BDNF gene.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna322-protects-hypoxiainduced-apoptosis-cardiomyocytes-via-bdnf-gene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069135,"mean":6.8476973499224,"rank":6130001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1081770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069135,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258753,"mean":11.687873029,"rank":182423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":40904,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258753,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296,"mean":1.5577830508475,"rank":112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.925,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
