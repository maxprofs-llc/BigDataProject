In a double-blind parallel randomised controlled trial, 59 Chinese T2D patients were randomised to receive either fish oil (FO), flaxseed oil (FSO) or corn oil capsules (CO, served as a control group) and followed up for 180 days. An additional 17 healthy non-T2D participants were recruited at baseline for cross-sectional comparison between cases and non-cases. A total of 296 serum metabolites were measured among healthy controls and T2D patients before and after the intervention. Serum 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoate (CMPF) (P-interaction\u2009=\u20091.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-7)) was the most significant metabolite identified by repeated-measures ANOVA, followed by eicosapentaenoate (P-interaction\u2009=\u20094.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-6)), 1-eicosapentaenoylglycerophosphocholine (P-interaction\u2009=\u20093.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-4)), docosahexaenoate (P-interaction\u2009=\u20090.001), linolenate (n-3 or n-6, P-interaction\u2009=\u20090.005) and docosapentaenoate (n-3, P-interaction\u2009=\u20090.021). CMPF level was lower in T2D patients than in the healthy controls (P\u2009=\u20090.014) and it was significantly increased in the FO compared with CO group (P\u2009=\u20091.17\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-7)). Furthermore, change of CMPF during the intervention was negatively correlated with change of serum triglycerides (P\u2009=\u20090.016). In conclusion, furan fatty acid metabolite CMPF was the strongest biomarker of fish oil intake. The association of CMPF with metabolic markers warrants further investigation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Ju-Sheng Zheng","Mei Lin","Fumiaki Imamura","Wenwen Cai","Ling Wang","Jue-Ping Feng","Yue Ruan","Jun Tang","Fenglei Wang","Hong Yang","Duo Li","Zheng, Ju-Sheng","Lin, Mei","Imamura, Fumiaki","Cai, Wenwen","Wang, Ling","Feng, Jue-Ping","Ruan, Yue","Tang, Jun","Wang, Fenglei","Yang, Hong","Li, Duo"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep29522","first_seen_on":"2016-07-12T17:27:21+00:00","funders":["niehs","mrc"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1470623884,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep29522","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27404516","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/srep29522"],"pmcid":"PMC4941578","pmid":"27404516","pubdate":"2016-07-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Epidemiology","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"29522","subjects":["science"],"title":"Serum metabolomics profiles in response to n-3 fatty acids in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes: a double-blind randomised controlled trial","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep29522","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serum-metabolomics-profiles-response-n3-fatty-acids-chinese-patients-type-2-diabetes-doubleblind-ran-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200470,"mean":6.9375281067398,"rank":1858217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6327170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200470,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259671,"mean":11.742379458543,"rank":73964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":184915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259671,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34621,"mean":14.811919295205,"rank":10934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":23591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34621,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3270,"mean":16.562721933313,"rank":998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":2260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3270,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
