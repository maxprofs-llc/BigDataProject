This process tolerated a variety of functional groups under mild conditions. Further diversification of pyrazoles was also investigated, which provided its potential for drug discovery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9f","doi":"10.1021\/jo400162d","first_seen_on":"2013-04-06T07:54:25+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Organic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1366893023,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jo400162d"],"pmid":"23547954","pubdate":"2013-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Copper-Catalyzed Aerobic C(sp<sup>2<\/sup>)-H Functionalization for C-N Bond Formation: Synthesis of Pyrazoles and Indazoles.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coppercatalyzed-aerobic-csp2h-functionalization-cn-bond-formation-synthesis-pyrazoles-indazoles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230503,"mean":5.96748679288,"rank":2389918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3768798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230503,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98544,"mean":6.9732252113291,"rank":37119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":59979,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98544,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3294,"mean":3.4779495900395,"rank":2010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":1244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3294,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":2.2182682926829,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
