Several psychological predictors, such as perceptions of competence, control, and engagement, may be associated with enjoyment of a game, which has in turn been hypothesized to predict energy expended during play. However, these relationships have yet to be tested in active video games.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f610005925","authors":["Lyons EJ","Tate DF","Ward DS","Ribisl KM","Bowling JM","Kalyanaraman S"],"doi":"10.1037\/a0031947","endpage":"181","first_seen_on":"2013-04-05T18:30:59+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["0278-6133","1930-7810"],"issue":"2","journal":"Health Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1399725784,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23527520","http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/journals\/hea\/33\/2\/174\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23527520?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23527520","pubdate":"2013-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"174","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Engagement, Enjoyment, and Energy Expenditure During Active Video Game Play.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/engagement-enjoyment-energy-expenditure-during-active-video-game-play-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":926240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3564495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89409,"mean":6.7727604464926,"rank":21271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":67726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89409,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":663,"mean":8.0732688821752,"rank":265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":663,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":12.583875,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
