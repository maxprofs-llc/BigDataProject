However, its biological activities against obesity have not been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of AG on the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. We found AG significantly inhibited not only on adipocyte differentiation induced by standard adipogenic agents and MDI, but also on the adipogenesis-related transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), as well as the expressions of the PPAR\u03b3 targeted genes, such as CD36, LPL, FAS and other adiocyte markers. Taken together, our data showed AG inhibited the early stage of adipogenic differentiation, in part via the inhibition of PPAR\u03b3-dependent mechanisms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310e","authors":["Lina Jin","Wenqiang Fang","Bo Li","Guojun Shi","Xiaoying Li","Ying Yang","Jian Yang","Zhiguo Zhang","Guang Ning","Jin, Lina","Fang, Wenqiang","Li, Bo","Shi, Guojun","Li, Xiaoying","Yang, Ying","Yang, Jian","Zhang, Zhiguo","Ning, Guang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mce.2012.02.025","endpage":"87","first_seen_on":"2013-04-07T19:55:14+00:00","issns":["03037207","1872-8057"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular & Cellular Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1335301682,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0303720712001621"],"pmid":"22449851","pubdate":"2012-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"81","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","endocrinology"],"title":"Inhibitory effect of Andrographolide in 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiation through the PPAR\u03b3 pathway","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0303720712001621","volume":"358","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibitory-effect-andrographolide-3t3l1-adipocytes-differentiation-through-ppar%CE%B3-pathway"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634361,"mean":4.9198212791297,"rank":2898176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634361,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85530,"mean":6.4871951501831,"rank":65821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85530,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":686,"mean":2.4296934306569,"rank":554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":686,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":2.7078947368421,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
