Diverse therapies such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiation have shown beneficial effects, but are limited because of their safety and toxicity. Probiotic formulations have shown great promise in CRC as preventive and early stage therapeutics. This review highlights the importance of a balanced intestinal microbiota and summarizes the recent developments in probiotics for treating CRC. Specifically, this report describes evidence of the role of probiotics in modulating the microbiota, in improving the physico-chemical conditions of the gut and in reducing oxidative stress. It also discusses the mechanisms of probiotics in inhibiting tumour progression, in producing anticancer compounds and in modulating the host immune response. Even though some of these effects were observed in several clinical trials, when probiotic formulations were used as a supplement to CRC therapies, the application of probiotics as biotherapeutics against CRC still needs further investigation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d51","doi":"10.1099\/jmm.0.048975-0","first_seen_on":"2013-04-06T18:23:46+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["1473-5644"],"journal":"Journal of Medical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1365272580,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23558140?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23558140","pubdate":"2013-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Probiotics in colorectal cancer (CRC) with emphasis on mechanisms of actions and current prospectives.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/probiotics-colorectal-cancer-crc-emphasis-mechanisms-action-current-perspectives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628563,"mean":4.9406420973419,"rank":2903253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":76276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628563,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85555,"mean":6.4982831194334,"rank":66047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85555,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":485,"mean":2.3300991735537,"rank":347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":485,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.775,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
