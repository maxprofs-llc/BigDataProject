We determine the full equilibrium phase diagram for arbitrary densities and plate separations from one to five hard-sphere diameters using free energy calculations. We find a first-order fluid-solid transition, which corresponds to either capillary freezing or melting depending on the plate separation. The coexisting solid phase consists of crystalline layers with either triangular ([Formula: see text]) or square ([Formula: see text]) symmetry. Increasing the plate separation, we find a sequence of crystal structures from [Formula: see text], where n is the number of crystal layers, in agreement with experiments on colloids. At high densities, the transition between square to triangular phases is interrupted by intermediate structures, e.g., prism, buckled, and rhombic phases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2006JPCM...18L.371F","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007df0","arxiv_id":"cond-mat\/0604169","doi":"10.1088\/0953-8984\/18\/28\/l02","first_seen_on":"2013-04-06T05:21:54+00:00","issns":["0953-8984"],"issue":"28","journal":"Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter","last_mentioned_on":1248780952,"links":["http:\/\/www.iop.org\/EJ\/abstract\/0953-8984\/18\/28\/L02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0953-8984\/18\/28\/L02\/pdf\/0953-8984_18_28_L02.pdf","pmid":"21690830","pubdate":"2006-07-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Condensed Matter Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"L371","subjects":["biophysics","nanotechnology"],"title":"Phase behaviour of hard spheres confined between parallel hard plates: manipulation of colloidal crystal structures by confinement","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phase-behavior-hard-spheres-confined-between-parallel-hard-plates-manipulation-colloidal-crystal-str"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228985,"mean":5.9651782765876,"rank":5293591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228985,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98541,"mean":6.9720182869901,"rank":79914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98541,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":951,"mean":2.2792147368421,"rank":653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":951,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.81944444444444,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
