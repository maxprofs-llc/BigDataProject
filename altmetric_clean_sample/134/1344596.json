Sedentary behaviour and physical activity are increasingly viewed as different constructs with independent effects on the disease process. The creation of the new sedentary behaviour paradigm is likely to have a significant impact on research and interventions aimed at the prevention and management of diabetes in the future. This article highlights the key concepts and implications of this new paradigm.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026fa","authors":["Thomas Yates","Emma G.
