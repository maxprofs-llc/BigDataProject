Postoperative cognitive problems are common in older patients following major surgery. The socioeconomic implications of these cognitive disorders are profound; cognitive decline is associated with a loss of independence, a reduction in the quality of life, and death. This review will focus on the two most common cognitive problems following surgery: postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000706b","authors":["Monk TG","Price CC","Terri G.
