In Kinetoplastid protists, however, virtually all control of gene expression is post-transcriptional. Correspondingly, Trypanosoma brucei heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) synthesis after heat shock depends on regulation of HSP70 mRNA turnover. We here show that the T. brucei CCCH zinc finger protein ZC3H11 is a post-transcriptional regulator of trypanosome chaperone mRNAs. ZC3H11 is essential in bloodstream-form trypanosomes and for recovery of insect-form trypanosomes from heat shock. ZC3H11 binds to mRNAs encoding heat-shock protein homologues, with clear specificity for the subset of trypanosome chaperones that is required for protein refolding. In procyclic forms, ZC3H11 was required for stabilisation of target chaperone-encoding mRNAs after heat shock, and the HSP70 mRNA was also decreased upon ZC3H11 depletion in bloodstream forms. Many mRNAs bound to ZC3H11 have a consensus AUU repeat motif in the 3'-untranslated region. ZC3H11 bound preferentially to AUU repeats in vitro, and ZC3H11 regulation of HSP70 mRNA in bloodstream forms depended on its AUU repeat region. Tethering of ZC3H11 to a reporter mRNA increased reporter expression, showing that it is capable of actively stabilizing an mRNA. These results show that expression of trypanosome heat-shock genes is controlled by a specific RNA-protein interaction. They also show that heat-shock-induced chaperone expression in procyclic trypanosome enhances parasite survival at elevated temperatures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334c","authors":["Dorothea Droll","Igor Minia","Abeer Fadda","Aditi Singh","Mhairi Stewart","Rafael Queiroz","Christine Clayton"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.ppat.1003286","first_seen_on":"2013-04-05T07:20:23+00:00","issns":["1553-7374"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS Pathogens","last_mentioned_on":1365146166,"links":["http:\/\/www.plospathogens.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1003286?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plospathogens%2FNewArticles+%28Ambra+-+Pathogens+New+Articles%29"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.ppat.1003286.pdf","pmid":"23592996","pubdate":"2013-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e1003286","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Post-Transcriptional Regulation of the Trypanosome Heat Shock Response by a Zinc Finger Protein","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/posttranscriptional-regulation-trypanosome-heat-shock-response-zinc-finger-protein-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629179,"mean":4.9362043867828,"rank":2901545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629179,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85533,"mean":6.4750697049059,"rank":65985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85533,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2930,"mean":7.8865947422328,"rank":2616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2930,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":9.8362147651007,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
