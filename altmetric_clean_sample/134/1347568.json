We describe two patients with pseudo-stroke manifestation of multiple myeloma. The first patient was a 60-year-old female with the initial presentation of multiple myeloma forming a large skull tumour compressing the brain with resultant symptoms of aphasia, limited logical contact and right upper extremity paresis. The second patient was a 69-year-old female who presented with a partial motor epileptic seizure involving both right limbs with persisting weakness of muscles and speech disturbances due to a skull tumour 4 years after the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Pseudo-stroke manifestation of multiple myeloma is extremely uncommon, however it can sometimes be observed both as an initial presentation and in the course of long-lasting disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610006005","authors":["Czapiewski P","Szmuda T","Dzier\u017canowski J","S\u0142oniewski P","Sworczak K","Gnaci\u0144ska M","Dubaniewicz-Wybieralska M","Hellmann A","Biernat W"],"first_seen_on":"2013-04-07T01:09:26+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Folia Neuropathologica","last_mentioned_on":1369551334,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23553141"],"pmid":"23553141","pubdate":"2013-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology","neurology"],"title":"Pseudo-stroke manifestation of multiple myeloma: a report of two cases with literature review.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pseudostroke-manifestation-multiple-myeloma-report-two-cases-literature-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":2670584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1695226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93587,"mean":6.9356029961748,"rank":46275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":35378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93587,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":2.4815217391304,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":12.466666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Linguistics":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sean_tiernan\/statuses\/338548950841839616","license":"public","citation_ids":[1347568],"posted_on":"2013-05-26T06:55:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Sean Tiernan","url":"http:\/\/mylifewithmyeloma.blogspot.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1552303712\/Sean_G__normal.png","description":"Professional Photographer covering portraiture, fashion, glamour and product photography.
