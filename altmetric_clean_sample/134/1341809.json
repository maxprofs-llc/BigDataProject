To determine the oxidative status, total peroxide level of plasma was measured in patients with drug-free depressive patients and compared with those of controls. Per cent ratio of total peroxide to TAOP was evaluated as oxidative stress index (OSI).\nPlasma TAOP and individual antioxidant levels were found to be lower in patients with depression than those of controls. On the contrary, the patients had high total plasma peroxide levels. OSI values of the patients were significantly higher than those of controls (P = 0.002), and a significant positive correlation between Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and OSI values was found (r = 0.54, P = 0.01).\nThe patients with major depression are exposed to oxidative stress, and OSI may be useful to reflect the severity of the disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000215a","authors":["Yanik, Medaim","Erel, Ozcan","Kati, Mahmut"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.0924-2708.2004.00090.x","endpage":"203","first_seen_on":"2013-04-05T17:23:06+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1601-5215","0924-2708"],"issue":"4","journal":"Acta Neuropsychiatrica","last_mentioned_on":1435268940,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.0924-2708.2004.00090.x\/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.0924-2708.2004.00090.x\/pdf","pmid":"26984307","pubdate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Munksgaard International Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"200","title":"The relationship between potency of oxidative stress and severity of depression","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-between-potency-oxidative-stress-severity-depression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5278250,"mean":6.2100123692557,"rank":661223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":4612645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5278250,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95224,"mean":6.9527289415372,"rank":13185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":81968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95224,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270,"mean":1.903531598513,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
