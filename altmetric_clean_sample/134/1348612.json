We examined the effects of cevimeline on salivary and plasma levels of substance-P- (SP-), calcitonin-gene-related-peptide- (CGRP-), and vasoactive-intestinal-polypeptide- (VIP-) like immunoreactive substances (ISs) in humans. An open-labeled crossover study was conducted on seven healthy volunteers. Saliva volume was measured, and saliva and venous blood samples were collected before and 30-240\u2009min after a single oral dose of cevimeline or placebo. Salivary and plasma levels of SP-, CGRP-, and VIP-IS were measured using a highly sensitive enzyme immunoassay. A single oral dose of cevimeline resulted in significant increases in salivary but not plasma SP-IS level compared to placebo. Cevimeline administration did not alter the salivary or plasma levels of CGRP-IS or VIP-IS compared to placebo. Significant increases in salivary volume were observed after cevimeline administration compared to placebo. A significant correlation was observed between the total release of SP-IS and that of salivary volume. These findings suggest an association of SP with the enhancement of salivary secretion by cevimeline.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e85","authors":["Takeyama, Masaharu"],"doi":"10.1155\/2013\/284765","first_seen_on":"2013-04-07T10:50:25+00:00","issns":["1687-9767"],"journal":"International Journal of Peptides","last_mentioned_on":1364130927,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ijpep\/2013\/284765\/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ijpep\/2013\/284765.pdf","pmid":"23589717","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Significant Increase in Salivary Substance P Level after a Single Oral Dose of Cevimeline in Humans","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/significant-increase-salivary-substance-p-level-after-single-oral-dose-cevimeline-humans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228730,"mean":5.9649848381607,"rank":5293407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228730,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98450,"mean":6.9983157167671,"rank":79867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98450,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.7416666666667,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
