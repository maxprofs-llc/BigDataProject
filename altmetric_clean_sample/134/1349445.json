With the risk of stroke increased with age, the safety of SSRI use among older adults attracts much concern. METHODS:: We analyzed 28,145 subjects older than 65 years from a subset of a 9-year cohort database from the National Health Insurance Research Database, Taiwan. RESULTS:: The survival analysis showed a greater probability of stroke in subjects with SSRI exposure after adjusting other covariates. Compared with other variables, SSRI exposure had the strongest effect (hazard ratio: 2.66, 95% confidence interval: 2.21-3.20). The risk was independent to depression-related stroke risk. CONCLUSIONS:: The use of SSRIs independently increases the risk of stroke among older patients. SSRIs are still practically safe to most users, providing precautionary measures are taken.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006978","doi":"10.1097\/jgp.0b013e31825c0e82","first_seen_on":"2013-04-07T17:00:57+00:00","issns":["1064-7481"],"issue":"","journal":"American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry: Official Journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1344507379,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ajgponline\/9000\/00000\/The_Association_of_Selective_Serotonin_Reuptake.99494.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ajgponline\/9000\/00000\/The_Association_of_Selective_Serotonin_Reuptake.99494.pdf","pmid":"22874576","pubdate":"2012-11-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["geriatrics","psychiatry"],"title":"The Association of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors Use and Stroke in Geriatric Population","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-stroke-geriatric-population"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627324,"mean":4.9493148749129,"rank":2906529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627324,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85475,"mean":6.5282243723238,"rank":66094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85475,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":592,"mean":3.5510998307953,"rank":454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":592,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":4.1372682926829,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
