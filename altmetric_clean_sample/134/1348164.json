With the significant toll of the disease, more resources have been invested in developing new treatment modalities. Among these medications, inhalational anticholinergics are widely used for the management of stable COPD. The newer agents, with longer half-lives and better safety profiles, have emerged and helped to improve management of COPD patients. The available data from randomized clinical trials support use of these agents. Multiple randomized clinical trials show safety and efficacy of the newer long-acting inhaled anticholinergics, including tiotropium and aclidinium. A recent meta-analysis of tiotropium delivered with Respimat(\u00ae) raised some safety concerns. A large trial, comparing different doses and delivery methods of inhaled tiotropium, is ongoing to determine the effect on mortality. As clinical trials may not comprehensively represent the entire COPD population, caution should be exercised when these agents are used in higher-risk populations, like individuals with cardiac arrhythmias or urinary obstruction. In this publication, we review the safety of inhalational anticholinergics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc00","authors":["Amir Sharafkhaneh"," Majid","nicholas gross"],"doi":"10.2147\/dhps.s7771","first_seen_on":"2013-04-07T07:40:03+00:00","issns":[""],"journal":"Drug, Healthcare and Patient Safety","last_mentioned_on":1364397121,"links":["http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/safety-and-tolerability-of-inhalational-anticholinergics-in-copd-peer-reviewed-article-DHPS","http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=12410"],"pmcid":"PMC3596125","pmid":"23526112","pubdate":"2013-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Safety and tolerability of inhalational anticholinergics in COPD","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-tolerability-inhalational-anticholinergics-copd"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230503,"mean":5.96748679288,"rank":4607812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230503,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98455,"mean":6.9998936965487,"rank":65978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":18573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98455,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":3.2375733333333,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":4.2108,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
