The results showed that with increased soil salinity, 1) both the chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) decreased, while the internal CO2 concentration firstly declined, and then increased in the MSL and LSCB; 2) carbohydrate contents in the MSL reduced significantly, while sucrose and starch contents in the LSCB increased, as did the activities of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and sucrose synthase (SuSy) in both the MSL and LSCB; 3) but invertase activity in both the MSL and LSCB did not change significantly. Our study also showed that the LSCB was more sensitive to soil salinity than was the MSL. Of the measured physiological indices, higher SPS activity, mainly controlled by sps3, may contribute to adaption of the LSCB to soil salinity stress because SPS is beneficial for efficiently sucrose synthesis, reduction of cellular osmotic potential and combined actions of Pn, and sucrose transformation rate and SPS may contribute to the reduction in boll weight under soil salinity stress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Peng, Jun","Liu, Jingran","Zhang, Lei","Luo, Junyu","Dong, Helin","Ma, Yan","Zhao, Xinhua","Chen, Binglin","Sui, Ning","Zhou, Zhiguo","Meng, Yali"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0156241","first_seen_on":"2016-05-27T13:08:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1464354248,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27228029?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4881904","pmid":"27228029","pubdate":"2016-05-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0156241","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Effects of Soil Salinity on Sucrose Metabolism in Cotton Leaves","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-soil-salinity-sucrose-metabolism-cotton-leaves"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7820779,"mean":6.6320512728979,"rank":6774240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7820779,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269213,"mean":11.454897976316,"rank":224276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269213,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110465,"mean":10.280010464948,"rank":93258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110465,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4737,"mean":13.005860641892,"rank":4158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4737,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
