Automatically quantifying and analyzing mitochondrial movement in a large quantity remain challenging. Here, we report an efficient method for imaging and quantifying axonal mitochondrial transport using microfluidic-chamber-cultured neurons together with a newly developed analysis package named \"MitoQuant\". This tool-kit consists of an automated program for tracking mitochondrial movement inside live neuronal axons and a transient-velocity analysis program for analyzing dynamic movement patterns of mitochondria. Using this method, we examined axonal mitochondrial movement both in cultured mammalian neurons and in motor neuron axons of Drosophila in vivo. In 3 different paradigms (temperature changes, drug treatment and genetic manipulation) that affect mitochondria, we have shown that this new method is highly efficient and sensitive for detecting changes in mitochondrial movement. The method significantly enhanced our ability to quantitatively analyze axonal mitochondrial movement and allowed us to detect dynamic changes in axonal mitochondrial transport that were not detected by traditional kymographic analyses.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81d3cf058f61000bbad","authors":["Chen, Mengmeng","Li, Yang","Yang, Mengxue","Chen, Xiaoping","Chen, Yemeng","Yang, Fan","Lu, Sheng","Yao, Shengyu","Zhou, Timothy","Liu, Jianghong","Zhu, Li","Du, Sidan","Wu, Jane Y"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13238-016-0268-3","first_seen_on":"2016-05-27T11:40:42+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1674-8018","1674-800X"],"issue":"11","journal":"Protein & Cell","last_mentioned_on":1474089319,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27225265?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27225265"],"pmid":"27225265","pubdate":"2016-05-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Developmental Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Protein Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Stem Cells","scheme":"springer"}],"subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"A new method for quantifying mitochondrial axonal transport","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-method-quantifying-mitochondrial-axonal-transport"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":948842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7430992,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273762,"mean":11.657797063862,"rank":44201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":228602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273762,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286,"mean":10.781522807018,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":9.3307692307692,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
