The objectives of this study were to determine the ranking of Candida among positive blood cultures, to define the epidemiology of candidaemia and to investigate patient characteristics and their relationship with C. albicans vs. non-albicans Candida (NAC) candidaemia. Candidaemia episodes between January 2001 and December 2010 were evaluated retrospectively. Patient characteristics were compared across Candida species. Candida ranked as the fifth most frequently isolated pathogen. Among 381 candidaemia episodes, 58.3% were due to C. albicans, followed by C. parapsilosis (15.2%), C. tropicalis (13.4%) and C. glabrata (6.8%). No statistically significant difference was observed in the distribution of C. albicans vs. NAC (P\u00a0=\u00a00.432). Patients with NAC had significantly higher rates of haematological disorders (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and neutropenia (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003), and were older (P\u00a0=\u00a00.024) than patients with C. albicans, whereas patients with urinary catheters had higher rates of C. albicans (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007). On species basis, C. tropicalis was more frequently isolated from patients with haematological disorders (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and neutropenia (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Patients with urinary catheters were less likely to have C. parapsilosis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.043). C. glabrata was most prevalent among patients with solid organ tumours (P\u00a0=\u00a00.038), but not evident in patients with haematological disorders. Local epidemiological features and risk factors may have important implications for the management of candidaemia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003140","authors":["Alp, Sehnaz","Arikan-Akdagli, Sevtap","Gulmez, Dolunay","Ascioglu, Sibel","Uzun, Omrum","Akova, Murat"],"doi":"10.1111\/myc.12349","endpage":"505","first_seen_on":"2016-05-27T20:30:23+00:00","issns":["1439-0507"],"issue":"8","journal":"Mycoses","last_mentioned_on":1464381008,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26155849?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26155849","pubdate":"2015-08-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"498","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Epidemiology of candidaemia in a tertiary care university hospital: 10-year experience with 381 candidaemia episodes between 2001 and 2010","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epidemiology-candidaemia-tertiary-care-university-hospital-10year-experience-381-candidaemia-episode"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7820779,"mean":6.6320512728979,"rank":6774229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7820779,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269214,"mean":11.454741390646,"rank":224270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269214,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":461,"mean":1.8351173913043,"rank":355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":461,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.7368,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
