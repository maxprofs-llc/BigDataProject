We investigated the key molecules that impair the regeneration of cholestatic liver. C57BL\/6 mice were randomly subjected to partial hepatectomy and bile duct ligation (PH+BDL group, n\u2009=\u200916), partial hepatectomy only (PH group, n\u2009=\u200916), or sham operation (Sham group, n\u2009=\u200916). The liver sizes and histological findings were similar in the PH and sham groups 14 days after operation. However, compared with those in the sham group, the livers in mice in the PH+BDL group had a smaller size, a lower cell proliferative activity, and more fibrotic tissue 14 days after the operation, suggesting the insufficient regeneration of the cholestatic liver. Pathway-focused array analysis showed that many genes were up- or down-regulated over 1.5-fold in both PH+BDL and PH groups at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after treatment. Interestingly, more genes that were functionally related to the extracellular matrix and inflammatory chemokines were found in the PH+BDL group than in the PH group at 7 and 14 days after treatment. Our data suggest that up-regulated extracellular matrix components and inflammatory chemokines may impair the regeneration of cholestatic liver.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Zhang, Shuai","Li, Tao-Sheng","Soyama, Akihiko","Tanaka, Takayuki","Yan, Chen","Sakai, Yusuke","Hidaka, Masaaki","Kinoshita, Ayaka","Natsuda, Koji","Fujii, Mio","Kugiyama, Tota","Baimakhanov, Zhassulan","Kuroki, Tamotsu","Gu, Weili","Eguchi, Susumu"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep26540","first_seen_on":"2016-05-27T12:14:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1464351269,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27226149?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4880910","pmid":"27226149","pubdate":"2016-05-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemokines","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"26540","subjects":["science"],"title":"Up-regulated extracellular matrix components and inflammatory chemokines may impair the regeneration of cholestatic liver","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/upregulated-extracellular-matrix-components-inflammatory-chemokines-impair-regeneration-cholestatic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7820779,"mean":6.6320512728979,"rank":6774246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7820779,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269213,"mean":11.454914134585,"rank":224281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269213,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30727,"mean":14.95332734492,"rank":26206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30727,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3137,"mean":14.927211734694,"rank":2585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3137,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
