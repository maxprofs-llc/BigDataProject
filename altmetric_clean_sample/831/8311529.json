Synthesized analogues significantly inhibited the production and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines against LPS-induced inflammation in macrophages isolated from mice. Among all the analogues, TAF-5 (1-Chloro-2-formyl-1-tetralene) exhibited most potent anti-inflammatory activity without any cytotoxic effect. We have further evaluated the therapeutic efficacy and safety of TAF-5 in in-vivo system using LPS-induced sepsis, a systemic inflammation model and acute oral toxicity respectively in mice. Oral administration of TAF-5 inhibited the pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum, attenuated the organs injuries and improved host survival in dose dependent manner. Acute oral toxicity study showed TAF-5 is non-toxic at higher dose in mice. These results suggest the suitability of indene and tetralene analogues as new chemical entities for further investigation towards the management of inflammation related diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ef","authors":["Mohanty, Shilpa","Gautam, Yashveer","Maurya, Anil Kumar","Negi, Arvind S","Prakash, Om","Khan, Feroz","Bawankule, Dnyaneshwar Umrao"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cbi.2015.12.005","endpage":"19","first_seen_on":"2016-05-27T11:20:36+00:00","issns":["1872-7786","00092797"],"journal":"Chemico-Biological Interactions","last_mentioned_on":1464348010,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26731479?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26731479","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"12","subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Indenes and tetralenes analogues attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation: An in-vitro and in-vivo study","type":"article","volume":"245","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/indenes-tetralenes-analogues-attenuates-lipopolysaccharideinduced-inflammation-invitro-invivo-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7820779,"mean":6.6320512728979,"rank":6774260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7820779,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269214,"mean":11.454906872996,"rank":224282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269214,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":872,"mean":2.7711572904707,"rank":720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":872,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":1.7429375,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
