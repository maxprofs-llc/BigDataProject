Single-center quality improvement (QI) initiatives have demonstrated decreased infection rates utilizing a bundled approach. This multicenter project was designed to assess the efficacy of a protocolized approach to decrease SWI.\nPediatric cardiac programs joined a collaborative effort to prevent SWI. Programs implemented the protocol, collected compliance data, and provided data points from local clinical registries using Society of Thoracic Surgery Congenital Heart Surgery Database harvest-compliant software or from other registries.\nNine programs prospectively collected compliance data on 4,198 children. Days between infections were extended from 68.2 days (range: 25-82) to 130 days (range: 43-412). Protocol compliance increased from 76.7% (first quarter) to 91.3% (final quarter). Ninety (1.9%) children developed an SWI preprotocol and 64 (1.5%) postprotocol, P = .18. The 657 (15%) delayed sternal closure patients had a 5% infection rate with 18 (5.7%) in year 1 and 14 (4.3%) in year 2 P = .43. Delayed sternal closure patients demonstrated a trend toward increased risk for SWI of 1.046 for each day the sternum remained open, P = .067. Children who received appropriately timed preop antibiotics developed less infections than those who did not, 1.9% versus 4.1%, P = .007.\nA multicenter QI project to reduce pediatric SWIs demonstrated an extension of days between infections and a decrease in SWIs. Patients who received preop antibiotics on time had lower SWI rates than those who did not.","authors":["Woodward, Cathy","Taylor, Richard","Son, Minnette","Taeed, Roozbeh","Jacobs, Marshall L","Kane, Lauren","Jacobs, Jeffrey P","Husain, S Adil"],"doi":"10.1177\/2150135117713741","first_seen_on":"2017-07-12T10:25:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2150-136X"],"issue":"4","journal":"World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgery","last_mentioned_on":1506767168,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28696877?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28696877","pubdate":"2017-07-12T22:00:55+00:00","title":"Multicenter Quality Improvement Project to Prevent Sternal Wound Infections in Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Patients.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multicenter-quality-improvement-project-prevent-sternal-wound-infections-pediatric-cardiac-surgery-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0.25,"6d":0.25,"5d":0.25,"4d":0.25,"3d":0.25,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BCM_CVRI\/statuses\/885082588402114560","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21792516],"posted_on":"2017-07-12T10:25:07+00:00","author":{"name":"BCM_CVRI","url":"http:\/\/www.bcm.edu\/cvri","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000515585721\/9f6ec1b7f20670f860e91837a1e3368e_normal.png","description":"The Official Twitter Account for the Baylor College of Medicine Cardiovascular Research Institute","id_on_source":"BCM_CVRI","tweeter_id":"1911846344","geo":{"lt":29.76328,"ln":-95.36327,"country":"US"},"followers":2265},"tweet_id":"885082588402114560"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BCM_CVRI\/statuses\/914073872030240768","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21792516],"posted_on":"2017-09-30T10:26:08+00:00","author":{"name":"BCM_CVRI","url":"http:\/\/www.bcm.edu\/cvri","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000515585721\/9f6ec1b7f20670f860e91837a1e3368e_normal.png","description":"The Official Twitter Account for the Baylor College of Medicine Cardiovascular Research Institute","id_on_source":"BCM_CVRI","tweeter_id":"1911846344","geo":{"lt":29.76328,"ln":-95.36327,"country":"US"},"followers":2265},"tweet_id":"914073872030240768"}]}}
