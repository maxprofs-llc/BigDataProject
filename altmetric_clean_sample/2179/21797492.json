In 2014, the U.S. Health Resources &amp; Services Administration (HRSA) leveraged Affordable Care Act funds to address these challenges through behavioral health integration. The objective of this study is to assess the US$55 million program's first-year impact on access and cost. This analysis uses multivariable difference-in-difference regression models to estimate changes in outcomes between the original 219 Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) Behavioral Health Integration grantees and two comparison groups. The primary outcome variables are annual depression screening rate, percentage of mental health and substance use patients served, and per capita cost. The results change when comparing the Behavioral Health Integration (BHI) grantees to a propensity score-matched comparison group versus comparing the grantees to the full population of health centers. After one year of implementation, the grant program appeared ineffective as measured by this study's outcomes, though costs did not significantly rise because of the program. This study has limitations that must be discussed, including non-randomized study design, FQHC data measurement, and BHI program design consequences. Time will tell if FQHC-based behavioral-physical health care integration will improve access among low-income, medically-underserved populations.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef752a83ee09648b5212","authors":["Evan Goldstein"],"doi":"10.3390\/healthcare5030032","first_seen_on":"2017-07-12T14:41:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2227-9032"],"issue":"3","journal":"Healthcare","last_mentioned_on":1501209058,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2227-9032\/5\/3\/32"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2227-9032\/5\/3\/32\/pdf","pmid":"28704970","pubdate":"2017-07-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Integrating Mental and Physical Health Care for Low-Income Americans: Assessing a Federal Program\u2019s Initial Impact on Access and Cost","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/integrating-mental-physical-health-care-lowincome-americans-assessing-federal-programs-initial-impac"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8337725,"mean":7.0303429782433,"rank":4201147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3922644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8337725,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223941,"mean":12.48523067786,"rank":113124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":101160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223941,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":5.473813559322,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.325,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/evangoldstein\/statuses\/890761145270841345","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21797492],"posted_on":"2017-07-28T02:29:41+00:00","author":{"name":"EVG","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/731273972436717571\/ehk5Kjp0_normal.jpg","description":"@ohiostate Fellow | @Cambridge_Uni & @TulaneNews Alum | Networks & policy linkages in healthcare, mental health, climate, & econ | MM F&AM","id_on_source":"evangoldstein","tweeter_id":"2447129012","geo":{"lt":49.1,"ln":1.96667,"country":"FR"},"followers":145},"tweet_id":"890761145270841345"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/885143016670887940","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21797492],"posted_on":"2017-07-12T14:25:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":982},"tweet_id":"885143016670887940"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/evangoldstein\/statuses\/890761470673391616","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21797492],"posted_on":"2017-07-28T02:30:58+00:00","author":{"name":"EVG","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/731273972436717571\/ehk5Kjp0_normal.jpg","description":"@ohiostate Fellow | @Cambridge_Uni & @TulaneNews Alum | Networks & policy linkages in healthcare, mental health, climate, & econ | MM F&AM","id_on_source":"evangoldstein","tweeter_id":"2447129012","geo":{"lt":49.1,"ln":1.96667,"country":"FR"},"followers":145},"tweet_id":"890761470673391616"}]}}
