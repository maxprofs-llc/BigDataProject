The case illustrates a dilemma for long-term care facilities that create a home-like environment with a goal of maximizing residents' autonomy while ensuring their safety. An approach to assessing capacity to consent to intimate sexual activity is described, followed by guidelines that nursing homes can implement to support residents who wish to engage in sexual activity. Recommendations are also offered for supporting long-term care staff and family members of residents who are interested in intimate sexual activity.","authors":["Metzger, Eran"],"doi":"10.1001\/journalofethics.2017.19.7.ecas1-1707","first_seen_on":"2017-07-12T14:42:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2376-6980"],"issue":"7","journal":"AMA Journal of Ethics","last_mentioned_on":1506132975,"links":["http:\/\/journalofethics.ama-assn.org\/2017\/07\/ecas1-1707.html?utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=Social_AMA&utm_term=968209976&utm_campaign=article_alert","http:\/\/journalofethics.ama-assn.org\/2017\/07\/ecas1-1707.html?utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=Social_AMA&utm_term=968212374&utm_campaign=article_alert","http:\/\/journalofethics.ama-assn.org\/2017\/07\/ecas1-1707.html?utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=Social_AMA&utm_term=968215547&utm_campaign=article_alert","http:\/\/journalofethics.ama-assn.org\/2017\/07\/ecas1-1707.html?utm_content=bufferdcfb3&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/journalofethics.ama-assn.org\/2017\/07\/ecas1-1707.html?utm_content=bufferbd303&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=28813236"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journalofethics.ama-assn.org\/2017\/07\/pdf\/ecas1-1707.pdf","pmid":"28813236","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Amer Med Assoc","title":"Ethics and Intimate Sexual Activity in Long-Term Care ...
