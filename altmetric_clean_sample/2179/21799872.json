However, most cells are produced postembryonically in, at least partly, differentiated organs. In this regard, organismal growth faces common challenges in coordinating expansion and function of body structures. Here we compare two examples for postembryonic growth processes from two different kingdoms of life to reveal common regulatory principles: lateral growth of plants and the enlargement of the fish retina. In both cases, growth is based on stem cell systems mediating radial growth by a bifacial mode of tissue production. Surprisingly, although being evolutionary distinct, we find similar patterns in regulatory circuits suggesting the existence of preferable solutions to a common developmental problem.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a3","authors":["Dongbo Shi","Tinatini Tavhelidse","Thomas Thumberger","Joachim Wittbrodt","Thomas Greb"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gde.2017.02.002","first_seen_on":"2017-07-12T16:08:20+00:00","issns":["0959437X"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Genetics & Development","last_mentioned_on":1488810722,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/authShare\/S0959437X16301344\/20170224T195300Z\/1?md5=71341a4a4c7f76f0e24cc132657d079f"],"pmid":"28242480","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Bifacial stem cell niches in fish and plants","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bifacial-stem-cell-niches-fish-plants"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.55,"score_history":{"1y":3.55,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":1964076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6343392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":221238,"mean":12.062727690215,"rank":66390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":154370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":221238,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":752,"mean":3.7704207723036,"rank":179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":572,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":752,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":6.284375,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
