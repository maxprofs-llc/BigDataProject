The dataset includes road accessibility as obtained from a minimization algorithm, and the amount of green space available to households in the neighborhood of the transactions, as evaluated from a land cover dataset. Further to the data presentation, the paper describes how these variables can be used to estimate the non-observable parameters of a residential choice function explicitly derived from a microeconomic model. The estimates are used by Caruso et al. (2015) to run a calibrated microeconomic urban growth simulation model where households are assumed to trade-off accessibility and local green space amenities.","altmetric_jid":"55b0f0292a83ee6a598b456b","authors":["Geoffrey Caruso","Jean Cavailh\u00e8s","Dominique Peeters","Isabelle Thomas","Pierre Frankhauser","Gilles Vuidel"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.dib.2015.09.047","endpage":"452","first_seen_on":"2016-04-07T10:42:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2352-3409","23523409"],"journal":"Data in Brief","last_mentioned_on":1460022922,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4610962\/?platform=hootsuite"],"pmid":"26958606","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","startpage":"447","title":"Housing land transaction data and structural econometric estimation of preference parameters for urban economic simulation models","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/housing-land-transaction-data-structural-econometric-estimation-preference-parameters-urban-economic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7516464,"mean":6.5017388130518,"rank":5689875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1005492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7516464,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270838,"mean":11.237246380664,"rank":190373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":41964,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270838,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":392,"mean":2.1264808184143,"rank":212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":392,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":2.2285714285714,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
