Next, we present the development and optimization of an in vitro assay to measure its activity. We then applied the assay to selected triphosphate analogs and discovered that 2'-C-methylated nucleosides exhibit strong inhibitory activity. Surprisingly, also carbocyclic derivatives with the carbohydrate locked in a North-like conformation as well as a ribonucleotide with a South conformation exhibited strong activity. Our results suggest that the traditional 2'-C-methylated nucleosides pursued in the race for anti-HCV treatment can be superseded by brand new scaffolds in the case of the Zika virus.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022bd","authors":["Kamil Herc\u00edk","Jaroslav Kozak","Michal \u0160\u00e1la","Milan Dejmek","Hubert H\u0159ebabeck\u00fd","Eva Zborn\u00edkov\u00e1","Miroslav Smola","Daniel Ruzek","Radim Nencka","Evzen Boura"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.antiviral.2016.11.020","first_seen_on":"2016-11-27T18:42:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01663542","1872-9096"],"journal":"Antiviral Research","last_mentioned_on":1493112858,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0166354216306143"],"pmid":"27902932","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Adenosine triphosphate analogs can efficiently inhibit the Zika virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adenosine-triphosphate-analogs-efficiently-inhibit-zika-virus-rnadependent-rna-polymerase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8203779,"mean":6.9449270433628,"rank":3874300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4147131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8203779,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270664,"mean":12.072045377462,"rank":127355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":136086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270664,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":788,"mean":5.0503583227446,"rank":386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":788,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":6.5539285714286,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
