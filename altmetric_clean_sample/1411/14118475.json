All compounds crystallize with the cubic MnCu2Al type structure (Heusler phase), space group Fm3[combining macron]m. The structure of Y(Ag0.39Au0.61)2Mg was refined from single crystal X-ray diffractometer data: a = 689.97(5) pm, wR2 = 0.0619, 52 F(2) values, 6 parameters. Magnetic susceptibility measurements show Pauli paramagnetic behavior for all samples. The compounds were investigated by (25)Mg, (89)Y and (115)In solid state MAS NMR spectroscopy. Large positive resonance shifts are observed for all nuclei. A review of the present data in the context of literature data on isotypic Heusler phases with Cd and Sn indicates that the (89)Y shifts show a correlation with the electronegativity of the main group atoms (Mg, Cd, In, Sn). The solid solutions Y(Ag1-xTx)2Mg (x = 0.1, 0.25, 0.33, 0.5; T = Pd, Au) clearly show Vegard-like behavior concerning their lattice parameters, and their main group element resonance shifts arising from spin and orbital contributions are close to the interpolated values of the corresponding end-member compounds.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Rainer Poettgen","Helmut Eckert","Christopher Benndorf","Sebastian Stein","Marcel Kersting","Lukas Heletta","Hellmut Eckert","Rainer P\u00f6ttgen"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6dt04097g","first_seen_on":"2016-11-28T03:27:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"1","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1481496569,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/DT\/C6DT04097G?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/DT\/C6DT04097G#!divAbstract","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2017\/DT\/C6DT04097G?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2017\/DT\/C6DT04097G#!divAbstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/dt\/c6dt04097g","pmid":"27924975","pubdate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"A 25Mg, 89Y and 115In solid state MAS NMR study of YT2X and Y(T0.5T\u20190.5)2X (T\/T\u2019 = Pd, Ag, Au; X = Mg, In) Heusler phases","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/25mg-89y-115in-solid-state-mas-nmr-study-yt2x-yt05t05-2x-tt-pd-ag-au-x-mg-heusler-phases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7876706,"mean":6.669712343671,"rank":5693117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1902858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7876706,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253859,"mean":12.178485318564,"rank":163840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":78091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253859,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10988,"mean":0.68694984982252,"rank":1733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":8398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10988,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":397,"mean":0.67689393939394,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":397,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
