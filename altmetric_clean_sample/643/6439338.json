These programs have been successful in achieving many of their initial goals of improving food purchases, food intake, and\/or nutritional status of low-income, vulnerable Americans. The emphasis in these programs has now broadened to also include an obesity prevention focus. Recent changes in program components demonstrate the revised objectives of the program. SNAP, WIC, and NSLP increase economic access to an adequate diet but access alone is unlikely to be the total solution to obesity prevention. An ecological approach, incorporating the nutrition programs, appears to be a more promising strategy to leverage the impact of SNAP, WIC, and NSLP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007065","authors":["Kennedy, Eileen","Guthrie, Joanne F","Eileen Kennedy","Joanne F.
