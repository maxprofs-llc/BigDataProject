It has been recently demonstrated that autophagy is part of the oncogene-induced senescence phenotype although its role in tumor establishment has not been completely clarified. In the present study, we showed that non\u2011transformed cells are sensitized to mitochondrial stress and autophagy induction when they are transformed by oncogenes such as c-Myc or Ras. We observed that overexpression of c-Myc or Ras increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and the expression of p62, a known partner for degradation by autophagy. The activation of AMPK was found to favor the activation of FoxO3 which was prevented by the inhibition of AMPK. The transcriptional activation mediated by FoxO3 upregulated genes such as BNIP3 and LC3. Finally, the transformation by oncogenes such as c-Myc and Ras predisposes tumor cells to autophagy induction as a consequence of mitochondrial stress and impairs tumor growth in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, which may have therapeutic implications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000837e","authors":["Gargini, Ricardo","Garc\u00eda-Escudero, Vega","Izquierdo, Marta","Wandosell, Francisco"],"doi":"10.3892\/or.2016.4699","first_seen_on":"2016-04-02T12:20:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-2431","1021-335X"],"journal":"Oncology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1459592463,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27035659?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27035659","pubdate":"2016-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Oncogene-mediated tumor transformation sensitizes cells to autophagy induction","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oncogenemediated-tumor-transformation-sensitizes-cells-autophagy-induction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7476637,"mean":6.4841716895094,"rank":6475357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7476637,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272232,"mean":11.147997641708,"rank":230259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272232,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1440,"mean":1.6741598332175,"rank":918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1440,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":6.6791666666667,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AutophagyPapers\/statuses\/716208819206955008","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6439416],"posted_on":"2016-04-02T10:21:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Autophagy Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/559405603697590273\/EoGNUIXe_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for #Autophagy papers.
