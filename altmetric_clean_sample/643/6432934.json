An increase in detection of women experiencing IPV through routine screening has not consistently shown a parallel increase in uptake of referrals or decreased abuse. This study investigates relationships between women's stage of change (SOC), mental health, abuse, social support, and self-efficacy. This study used data from a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention to improve outcomes for women afraid of their partners (n= 225; WEAVE). Women's progress toward change was categorized into pre-contemplation\/contemplation (pre-change SOC) or preparation\/action\/maintenance of change (change-related SOC). Characteristics of women ending the 2-year study in pre-change SOC were compared with those always in change-related and those ending in change-related SOC. Variables were analyzed using multinomial logistic regressions at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months. Compared with women in pre-change SOC, women always in change-related SOC or ending in change-related SOC are significantly more likely to have higher levels of self-efficacy at 6 (AdjOR = 1.19, confidence interval [CI] = [1.08, 1.30]) and 24 months (AdjOR = 1.21, CI = [1.04, 1.40]). Women always in change-related SOC are always significantly less likely to live with an intimate partner. Women ending in change-related SOC are less likely to live with a partner at 12 (AdjOR = 0.30, CI = [0.12, 0.75]) and 24 (AdjOR = 0.22, CI = [0.06, 0.80]) months. Clinicians should focus on enhancing abused women's self-efficacy, supporting them to create and maintain positive changes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f6100017f5","authors":["Sonia A.
