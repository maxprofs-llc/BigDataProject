Synergizing combinatorial and computational chemistries emerged as a time-efficient strategy to explore the chemical space more widely. Ideally, streamlining the evaluation process for larger, feasible chemical libraries would become commonplace. Thus, combinatorial tools and, for example, docking methods would be integrated to identify novel bioactive entities. The idea is simple in nature, but much more complex in practice; combinatorial chemistry is more than the coupling of chemicals into products: synthetic feasibility includes chemoselectivity, stereoselectivity, protecting group chemistry and chemical availability which must all be considered for combinatorial library design. In addition, intuitive interfaces and simple user manipulation is key for optimal use of such tools by organic chemists-crucial for the integration of such software in medicinal chemistry laboratories. We present herein FINDERS and REACT2D-integrated into the VIRTUAL CHEMIST platform, a modular software suite. This approach enhances virtual combinatorial chemistry by identifying available chemicals compatible with a user-defined chemical transformation and by carrying out the reaction leading to libraries of realistic, synthetically accessible chemicals-all with a completely automated, black-box, and efficient design. We demonstrate its utility by generating ~40 million synthetically accessible, stereochemically accurate compounds from a single library of 100,000 purchasable molecules and 56 well-characterized chemical reactions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5723cf058f610004c74","authors":["Joshua Pottel","Nicolas Moitessier"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jcim.6b00648","first_seen_on":"2017-04-24T17:00:19+00:00","issns":["1549-9596","1549-960X"],"journal":"Journal of Chemical Information & Modeling","last_mentioned_on":1493080146,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jcim.6b00648"],"pmid":"28234470","pubdate":"2017-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Computation Theory And Mathematics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Social Sciences","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"subjects":["chemistry","medicalinformatics"],"title":"Customizable Generation of Synthetically Accessible, Local Chemical Subspaces","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/customizable-generation-synthetically-accessible-local-chemical-subspaces"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.7,"score_history":{"1y":2.7,"6m":2.7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8098931,"mean":6.8880547472244,"rank":3222003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4851274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8098931,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233669,"mean":12.681472508003,"rank":83994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":148532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233669,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1395,"mean":3.940949784792,"rank":584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1395,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":3.9106896551724,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
