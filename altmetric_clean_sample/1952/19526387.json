Individuals with scoliosis treated operatively or non-operatively have been reported to participate in less than 1-3 days\/week of even mildly strenuous physical exercises. Over 40% of individuals with scoliosis returned to sports at a level lower than pre-operative participation levels or did not return at all post spinal fusion. It is particularly important for human movement specialists, such as physical therapists, occupational therapists, athletic trainers and kinesiologists to assist these individuals effectively transition to and maintain engagement in physical activity. This review provides a snapshot of common considerations and potential factors influencing individuals with spinal-fusion for scoliosis to participate in safe physical activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6b83cf058f610009c1c","authors":["Kakar, Rumit Singh","Simpson, Kathy J","DAS, Bhibha M","Brown, Cathleen
