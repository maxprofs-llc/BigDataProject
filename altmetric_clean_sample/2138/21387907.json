Stem cells derived from the placenta have been investigated in a number of disease processes, including wound healing, ischemic heart disease, autoimmune disorders, and chronic lung or liver injury. Fetal intervention for structural congenital defects, such as spina bifida, has rapidly progressed as a field due to advances in maternal-fetal medicine and improving surgical techniques. In utero treatment of structural, as well as non-structural, congenital disorders with cell-based therapies is of particular interest given the immunologic immaturity and immunotolerant environment of the developing fetus. A comprehensive literature review was performed to assess the potential utilization of placenta-derived stem cells for in utero treatment of congenital disorders. Most studies are still in the preclinical phase, utilizing animal models of common congenital disorders. Future research endeavors may include autologous transplantation, gene transfers, induced pluripotent stem cells, or cell-free therapies derived from the stem cell secretome. Though much work still needs to be done, placental stem cells are a promising therapeutic agent for fetal intervention for congenital disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008eed","authors":["Melissa Vanover","Aijun Wang","Diana Farmer"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.placenta.2017.05.010","first_seen_on":"2017-06-28T10:02:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["01434004","1532-3102"],"journal":"Placenta","last_mentioned_on":1498644131,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28651900?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28651900","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["obstetrics","embryology","physiology"],"title":"Potential clinical applications of placental stem cells for use in fetal therapy of birth defects","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-clinical-applications-placental-stem-cells-fetal-therapy-birth-defects"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":7289375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236236,"mean":12.984559679979,"rank":193811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236236,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":967,"mean":2.0110952380952,"rank":559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":967,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":2.0026666666667,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":6},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroStemCell\/statuses\/880003387206508544","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21387907],"posted_on":"2017-06-28T10:02:11+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroStemCells","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/707584357620326400\/X_4h3j5X_normal.jpg","description":"Everything about #NeuroStemCells #StemCells #BrainOrganoids Research.
