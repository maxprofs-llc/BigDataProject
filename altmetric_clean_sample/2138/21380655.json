The mol-ecule displays a common zigzag conformation. The five-membered ring has a twisted conformation on the C-C bond. In the crystal, a strong inter-molecular hydrogen bond between the hy-droxy group and the carboxyl-ate moiety from an adjacent mol-ecule forms chains propagating along the b-axis direction. The absolute structure of the mol-ecule in the crystal was determined by resonant scattering [Flack parameter = 0.05\u2005(6)].","authors":["Morales-Rivera, K.F.","Pi\u00f1ero Cruz, D.M.","Prieto, J.A.","Morales-Rivera, K.F.","Pi\u00f1ero Cruz, D.M.","Prieto, J.A.","IUCr"],"doi":"10.1107\/s2056989017009318","first_seen_on":"2017-06-28T00:00:19+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"handles":[],"issns":["2056-9890"],"issue":"Pt 7","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section E: Crystallographic Communications","last_mentioned_on":1498608004,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S2056989017009318"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/e\/issues\/2017\/07\/00\/su5376\/su5376.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5499293","pmid":"28775885","pubdate":"2017-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","title":"Crystal structure of (\u2212)-(S)-4-[(2S,3S,4S,Z)-3-hydroxy-4-methylhept-5-en-2-yl]-1,3-dioxolan-2-one","type":"article","volume":"73","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystal-structure-s42-s3-s4-s-z3hydroxy4methylhept5en2yl13dioxolan2one"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ActaCrystE\/statuses\/879851856410947588","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21380655],"posted_on":"2017-06-28T00:00:04+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"ActaCrystE","tweeter_id":"587565184","geo":{"lt":53.1905,"ln":-2.89189,"country":"GB"}},"tweet_id":"879851856410947588"}]}}
