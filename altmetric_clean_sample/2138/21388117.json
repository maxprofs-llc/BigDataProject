There exists an ambiguity in the diagnosis of amoebiasis, and hence there arises a necessity for a better diagnostic approach. Serine-rich Entamoeba histolyticaprotein (SREHP), peroxiredoxin and Gal\/GalNAc lectin are pivotal in E. histolyticavirulence and are extensively studied as diagnostic and vaccine targets. For elucidating the cellular function of these proteins, details regarding their respective quaternary structures are essential. However, studies in this aspect are scant. Hence, this study was carried out to predict the structure of these target proteins and characterize them structurally as well as functionally using appropriate in-silicomethods.\nThe amino acid sequences of the proteins were retrieved from National Centre for Biotechnology Information database and aligned using ClustalW. Bioinformatic tools were employed in the secondary structure and tertiary structure prediction. The predicted structure was validated, and final refinement was carried out.\nThe protein structures predicted by i-TASSER were found to be more accurate than Phyre2 based on the validation using SAVES server. The prediction suggests SREHP to be an extracellular protein, peroxiredoxin a peripheral membrane protein while Gal\/GalNAc lectin was found to be a cell-wall protein. Signal peptides were found in the amino-acid sequences of SREHP and Gal\/GalNAc lectin, whereas they were not present in the peroxiredoxin sequence. Gal\/GalNAc lectin showed better antigenicity than the other two proteins studied. All the three proteins exhibited similarity in their structures and were mostly composed of loops.\nThe structures of SREHP and peroxiredoxin were predicted successfully, while the structure of Gal\/GalNAc lectin could not be predicted as it was a complex protein composed of sub-units. Also, this protein showed less similarity with the available structural homologs. The quaternary structures of SREHP and peroxiredoxin predicted from this study would provide better structural and functional insights into these proteins and may aid in development of newer diagnostic assays or enhancement of the available treatment modalities.","altmetric_jid":"521f51273cf0582f62000000","authors":["Kumar Manochitra","Subhash Chandra Parija"],"doi":"10.7717\/peerj.3160","first_seen_on":"2017-06-28T10:09:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2167-8359"],"journal":"PeerJ","last_mentioned_on":1498722421,"links":["https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/3160\/"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/3160.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5493030","pmid":"28674640","pubdate":"2017-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"PeerJ Inc.","title":"In-silico prediction and modeling of the Entamoeba histolytica proteins: Serine-rich Entamoeba histolytica protein and 29\u00a0kDa Cysteine-rich protease","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/insilico-prediction-modeling-entamoeba-histolytica-proteins-serine-rich-entamoeba-histolytica-protei"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":4509691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2350987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236529,"mean":12.988748198944,"rank":132148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":82421,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236529,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3778,"mean":20.945663754302,"rank":3090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3778,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":340,"mean":20.214259587021,"rank":246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":77,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":340,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
