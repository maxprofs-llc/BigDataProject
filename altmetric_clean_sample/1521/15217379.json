In the solid state, both 2-formyl- and 2-acetyl-benzoic acids exist as the cyclic phthalide form each containing a five-membered lactone ring and a cyclic hemiacetal\/hemiketal group. Static and magic-angle-spinning (17)O NMR spectra were recorded at 14.1 and 21.1T for these compounds, from which the (17)O chemical shift and nuclear quadrupolar coupling tensors were determined for each oxygen site. These results represent the first time that (17)O NMR tensors are fully characterized for lactone, cyclic hemiacetal, and cyclic hemiketal functional groups. We also report solid-state (17)O NMR data for the cyclic hemiketal group an anticoagulant drug, warfarin. Experimental (17)O NMR tensors in these compounds were compared with computational results obtained with a periodic DFT code BAND.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003582","authors":["Xianqi Kong","Yizhe Dai","Gang Wu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ssnmr.2016.12.011","first_seen_on":"2017-01-04T01:10:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09262040","1527-3326"],"journal":"Solid State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance","last_mentioned_on":1483492232,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0926204016301199"],"pmid":"28057400","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Condensed Matter Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
