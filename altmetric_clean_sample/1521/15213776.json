While many parkinsonian disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and multiple system atrophy are classified as synucleinopathies, progressive supranuclear palsy is coined a tauopathy due to the aggregation of pathological tau in the brain. [(18)F]AV-1451 (also known as [(18)F]-T807) is a positron emission tomography radiotracer that binds to paired helical filaments of tau in Alzheimer's disease. We investigated whether [(18)F]AV-1451 could be used as biomarker for the diagnosis and disease progression monitoring in progressive supranuclear palsy. Six progressive supranuclear palsy, six Parkinson's disease, and 10 age-matched healthy controls were recruited. An anatomical MRI and a 90-min PET scan, using [(18)F]AV-1451, were acquired from all participants. The standardized uptake value ratio from 60 to 90\u2009min post-injection was calculated in each region of interest, using the cerebellar cortex as a reference region. No significant differences in standardized uptake value ratios were detected in our progressive supranuclear palsy group compared to the two control groups. [(18)F]AV-1451 may bind selectivity to the paired helical filaments in Alzheimer's disease, which differ from the straight conformation of tau filaments in progressive supranuclear palsy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce7","authors":["Sarah Coakeley","Coakeley, Sarah","Cho, Sang Soo","Koshimori, Yuko","Rusjan, Pablo","Harris, Madeleine","Ghadery, Christine","Kim, Jinhee","Lang, Anthony E","Wilson, Alan","Houle, Sylvain","Strafella, Antonio P"],"doi":"10.1177\/0271678x16683695","first_seen_on":"2017-01-03T18:45:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-7016"],"journal":"Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1486401936,"links":["http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/0271678X16683695#.WGvxBY5qxD0.twitter","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/0271678X16683695","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28155586"],"pmid":"28155586","pubdate":"2017-02-06T12:28:52+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["metabolism","brain"],"title":"Positron emission tomography imaging of tau pathology in progressive supranuclear palsy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/positron-emission-tomography-imaging-tau-pathology-progressive-supranuclear-palsy-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.3,"score_history":{"1y":6.3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170298,"mean":6.9145785001388,"rank":1299811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6867287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170298,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263669,"mean":12.5521159716,"rank":62450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":200967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263669,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1371,"mean":5.1013854014599,"rank":426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1371,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":4.1064516129032,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
