Extended non-weightbearing can have adverse effects, and operative treatment poses various risks. We report the clinical results of patients treated without weightbearing restriction. All patients treated for metatarsal fractures by a single surgeon from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2009 were identified through the clinical billing records by International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, code. Through a radiographic and medical record review, 27 consecutive patients with acute Jones fractures treated without weightbearing restriction were identified. The demographic information and clinical and radiographic results were recorded. Of the 27 patients, 24 (89%) had achieved clinical union at a mean of 8.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6\u00a0weeks. Complete radiographic union was noted in 13 (48%) patients, and 13 (48%) others had made significant progress toward radiographic union but had not yet reached it. Two (8.3%) patients were lost to follow-up. One patient (4%) developed nonunion. Patients with acute Jones fractures can be treated without weightbearing restriction. This protocol results in rapid clinical union and a low rate of nonunion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a39","authors":["Marecek, Geoffrey S","Earhart, Jeffrey S","Croom, William P","Merk, Bradley R"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.jfas.2016.04.013","endpage":"964","first_seen_on":"2017-01-03T18:50:16+00:00","issns":["1542-2224","10672516"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Foot & Ankle Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1483469401,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27297739"],"pmid":"27297739","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"961","subjects":["orthopedics","generalsurgery"],"title":"Treatment of Acute Jones Fractures Without Weightbearing Restriction","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/treatment-acute-jones-fractures-without-weightbearing-restriction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7976486,"mean":6.7343932358615,"rank":3956503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3816293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7976486,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253485,"mean":12.593591216802,"rank":131335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":112451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253485,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":491,"mean":2.5880612244898,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":491,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":1.1,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
