She was found to have severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, high lactate, high lactate dehydrogenase and low haptoglobin. Peripheral smear revealed multilobulated neutrophils with schistocytes, poikilocytes and anisocytes.\nShe was admitted to intensive care unit for altered mental status, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome with severe metabolic acidosis in setting of hemolysis. She was intubated and managed with intravenous antibiotics and blood transfusion. Patient improved significantly after blood transfusion. Lactic acid normalized, acute kidney injury resolved and mentation improved after transfusion. Laboratory investigation revealed low vitamin B12, high methylmalonic acid, high homocysteine, high lactate dehydrogenase, low haptoglobin, high anti-parietal antibody and high anti-intrinsic factor antibody. Patient was diagnosed with pernicious anemia and pseudo-thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura with concomitant intramedullary hemolysis. Her hematological parameters and her clinical condition improved significantly after starting therapy with cyanocobalamin.\nPernicious anemia is a chronic disease with subtle presentation but may present as life-threatening complications. Hemolysis and pseudo-thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura may present as multi-organ dysfunction syndrome which has dramatic response to appropriate therapy.","altmetric_jid":"53aabad42a83eec94f8b4567","authors":["Kandel, Saroj","Budhathoki, Nibash","Pandey, Shanta","Bhattarai, Bikash","Baqui, Aam","Pandey, Ramesh","Salhan, Divya","Enriquez, Danilo","Quist, Joseph","Schmidt, Frances M","Saroj Kandel","Nibash Budhathoki","Shanta Pandey","Bikash Bhattarai","Aam Baqui","Ramesh Pandey","Divya Salhan","Danilo Enriquez","Joseph Quist","Frances M Schmidt"],"doi":"10.1177\/2050313x17713149","first_seen_on":"2017-06-06T14:10:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2050-313X"],"journal":"SAGE Open Medical Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1497970861,"links":["http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/2050313X17713149","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28620491\/?i=3&from=b12","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/2050313x17713149"],"pmcid":"PMC5464511","pmid":"28620491","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","title":"Pseudo-thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura presenting as multi-organ dysfunction syndrome: A rare complication of pernicious anemia","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pseudothrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-presenting-multiorgan-dysfunction-syndrome-rare-complicati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":3.5,"6m":3.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":2000566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6358356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244716,"mean":12.631721651717,"rank":76101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":167855,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244716,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":2.3997619047619,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SarojMD\/statuses\/872093305122820098","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20853941],"posted_on":"2017-06-06T14:10:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Saroj Prakash Kandel","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/871863286597394432\/q2I-irrx_normal.jpg","description":"pulm fellow, interested in #pulmCC #sleepmedicine. happy husband. life is beautiful. optimistic","id_on_source":"SarojMD","tweeter_id":"160932452","geo":{"lt":40.6501,"ln":-73.94958,"country":"US"},"followers":1446},"tweet_id":"872093305122820098"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/shantapandey\/statuses\/872265289479704577","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20853941],"posted_on":"2017-06-07T01:33:45+00:00","author":{"name":"shanta pandey","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/834249749230399488\/JO2xsyDM_normal.jpg","description":"Resident physician,food fanatic,ardent music lover and passionate about travelling.","id_on_source":"shantapandey","tweeter_id":"317777934","geo":{"lt":40.6501,"ln":-73.94958,"country":"US"},"followers":261},"tweet_id":"872265289479704577"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/QueenBTwelve\/statuses\/877087865955639296","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20853941],"posted_on":"2017-06-20T08:56:57+00:00","author":{"name":"B TWELVE","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/836860029902913537\/zaJ_q-tX_normal.jpg","description":"\u25b6 Andrea\u25aa\ufe0fWife\u25aaMum to 4 beautiful girls\u25aaNanny 1st Grandson \u25aa\ufe0fMCV 108 \u25aa\ufe0fB12 75 ng\/L \u25aa\ufe0fFolate 1.1 \u25aa\ufe0fAbNegPA & Folate Deficient since 2012 \u2757\ufe0fNO ANAEMIA\u2757\ufe0f#b12d \ud83d\udc89","id_on_source":"QueenBTwelve","tweeter_id":"416925049","geo":{"lt":56,"ln":-4,"country":"GB"},"followers":1133},"tweet_id":"877087865955639296"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SallyB12Movie\/statuses\/877158845268799490","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20853941],"posted_on":"2017-06-20T13:39:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Sally Pacholok Movie","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OvMxJ6GRBNQ","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/525478673797750785\/EUKX6NFs_normal.jpeg","description":"Feisty ER nurse takes on the medical establishment when she uncovers an epidemic of misdiagnosis.
