The clinical data showed that PDGFR\u03b1 expression was higher in canine subjects with MDR T-cell lymphoma than in those with untreated T-cell lymphoma, and that c-KIT expression was greater in subjects with T-cell lymphoma than in those with B-cell lymphoma. TOC monotherapy was well tolerated without serious adverse effects, and two of the five subjects that received TOC exhibited partial responses. The data presented here could contribute to the assessment of TOC-based therapy for dogs with MDR or T-cell lymphoma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f1f","authors":["Hiroki YAMAZAKI","Naoki MIURA","Yu-Chang LAI","Masashi TAKAHASHI","Yuko GOTO-KOSHINO","Momoi YASUYUKI","Munekazu NAKAICHI","Hajime TSUJIMOTO","Asuka SETOGUCHI","Yasuyuki ENDO"],"doi":"10.1292\/jvms.16-0457","first_seen_on":"2017-06-06T14:03:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0916-7250","1347-7439"],"journal":"Journal of Veterinary Medical Science","last_mentioned_on":1496870160,"links":["https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/jvms\/advpub\/0\/advpub_16-0457\/_article"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/jvms\/advpub\/0\/advpub_16-0457\/_pdf","pmid":"28592719","pubdate":"2017-06-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"JAPANESE SOCIETY OF VETERINARY SCIENCE","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Effects of toceranib phosphate (palladia) monotherapy on multidrug resistant lymphoma in dogs","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-toceranib-phosphate-palladia-monotherapy-multidrug-resistant-lymphoma-dogs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":6024499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2009110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241925,"mean":12.43443306989,"rank":156645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":70956,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241925,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1578,"mean":1.0904350031706,"rank":439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1578,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.3630434782609,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
