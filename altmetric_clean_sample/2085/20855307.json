Mixed models were used to estimate progression rates, and a generalized linear model to compute the relative risk of BCVA loss, loss of ellipsoid zone (EZ) reflectivity, development of pigment plaques, or neovascularization.\nOne thousand and fourteen eyes of 507 participants were followed for 4.2 \u00b1 1.6 years. Best-corrected visual acuity decreased 1.07 \u00b1 0.05 letters (mean \u00b1 SE) per year. Of all eyes, 15% lost \u226515 letters after 5 years. Of the eyes without EZ loss, 76% developed a noncentral loss. Of the eyes with noncentral loss, 45% progressed to central EZ loss. The rate of BCVA loss in eyes with noncentral EZ loss at baseline was similar to eyes without EZ loss. The rate of BCVA loss was significantly higher in eyes with central EZ loss at baseline (-1.40 \u00b1 0.14 letters, P < 0.001).\nEllipsoid zone loss is frequently found in macular telangiectasia Type 2 and is an important structural component reflecting visual function. Its presence in the fovea significantly correlates with worse visual prognosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6363cf058f610008765","authors":["Peto, Tunde","Heeren, Tjebo F.
