This study examined the toxicity and accumulation behavior of cesium towards P. aeruginosa PAO1 and its capacity to remove cesium from waste water. Interestingly, the programmed bacterial growth inhibition occurred according to the cesium environment. The influence of cesium was analyzed using several optical methods for quantitative evaluation. Cesium plays vital role in the growth of microorganisms and functions as an anti-microbial agent. The toxicity of Cs to P. aeruginosa PAO1 increases as the concentration of cesium is increased in concentration-dependent manner. P. aeruginosa PAO1 shows excellent Cs removal efficiency of 76.1% from the contaminated water. The toxicity of cesium on the cell wall and in the cytoplasm were studied by transmission electron microscopy and electron dispersive X-ray analysis. Finally, the removal of cesium from wastewater using P. aeruginosa PAO1 as a potential biosorbent and the blocking of competitive interactions of other monovalent cation, such as potassium, were assessed. Overall, P. aeruginosa PAO1 can be used as a high efficient biomaterial in the field of radioactive waste disposal and management.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dcc","authors":["Kang, Sung-Min","Jang, Sung-Chan","Heo, Nam Su","Oh, Seo Yeong","Cho, Hye-Jin","Rethinasabapathy, Muruganantham","Vilian, A.T.
