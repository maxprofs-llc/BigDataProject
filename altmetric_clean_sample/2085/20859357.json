This study was performed to evaluate the validity of the CO-ROP model in a tertiary referral county hospital.\nThree hundred seventy-four consecutive newborns screened for ROP using national screening guidelines at Parkland Hospital (Dallas, TX) from April 1, 2009 to August 30, 2013 were retrospectively applied to the CO-ROP model. Sensitivities and specificities for identifying ROP were calculated.\nOut of 374 infants, 29 (7.8%) developed type 1 ROP and 12 (3.2%) developed type 2 ROP. The CO-ROP model would have decreased number of infants screened by 34% compared to current national screening criteria. CO-ROP had sensitivity of 93.1% (95% CI, 77.2-99.1) and 92.7% (95% CI, 61.5-99.8) for identifying type 1 and type 2 ROP, respectively. Two out of 29 patients who developed type 1 ROP were not identified using CO-ROP.\nThe CO-ROP model significantly reduced total number screened but failed to detect 2 infants with type I ROP. Further modification to this screening model is needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b5b","authors":["Huang, Jason M.","Lin, Xihui","He, Yu-Guang","Cao, Jennifer H."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jaapos.2017.02.008","first_seen_on":"2017-06-06T19:05:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1091-8531","10918531","1528-3933"],"journal":"Journal of AAPOS (Journal of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus)","last_mentioned_on":1496775915,"links":["http:\/\/www.jaapos.org\/article\/S1091-8531(16)30427-X\/fulltext?rss=yes"],"pmid":"28587880","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics","ophthalmology"],"title":"Colorado-Retinopathy of Prematurity (CO-ROP) Screening Algorithm: a validation study at a tertiary care center","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/withdrawn-coloradoretinopathy-prematurity-corop-screening-algorithm-validation-study-tertiary-care-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8324953,"mean":7.0165383958894,"rank":6317405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1127032,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8324953,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241576,"mean":12.355551004864,"rank":170711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44731,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241576,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":579,"mean":2.4989342560554,"rank":298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":579,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.1527777777778,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OphthoMag\/statuses\/872167521037799425","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20859357],"posted_on":"2017-06-06T19:05:15+00:00","author":{"name":"The Ophthalmologist","url":"http:\/\/www.theophthalmologist.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/722443730549137408\/CeJXFvaK_normal.jpg","description":"Bringing you the latest in #ophthalmology, from the groundbreaking innovations to the personal stories.
