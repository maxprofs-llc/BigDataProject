The pathogenicity gene WISH is predicted to encode a novel seven transmembrane protein in the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, one of the deadliest pathogens of rice. We generated knockout mutants through a homologous recombination-based method to understand the function of the gene. These mutants are nonpathogenic due to a defect in sensing hydrophobic surface and appressorium differentiation. The mutant failed to undergo early events of pathogenesis, and appressorium development is diminished on inductive hydrophobic surface and was unable to penetrate susceptible rice leaves. The \u0394wish mutant did not develop any appressorium, suggesting that WISH protein is required for appressorium morphogenesis and is also involved in host surface recognition. We examined various aspects of pathogenesis and the results indicated involvement of WISH in preventing autolysis of vegetative hyphae, determining surface hydrophobicity and maintenance of cell-wall integrity. WISH gene from M. oryzae strain B157 complemented the \u0394wish mutant, indicating functional authenticity. Exogenous activation of cellular signaling failed to suppress the defects in \u0394wish mutants. These findings suggest that WISH GPCR senses diverse extracellular signals to play multiple roles and might have effects on PTH11 and MPG1 genes especially as an upstream effector of appressorium differentiation. It is for the first time that a typical GPCR containing seven transmembrane helices involved in the early events of plant pathogenesis of M. oryzae has been functionally characterized.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002922","authors":["Sabnam, Nazmiara","Barman, Subhankar Roy"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fgb.2017.05.006","first_seen_on":"2017-06-06T12:19:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1087-1845"],"journal":"Fungal Genetics & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1496751911,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28576657?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28576657","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology","genetics"],"title":"WISH,  a Novel  CFEM GPCR  is Indispensable for Surface Sensing, Asexual and Pathogenic Differentiation in Rice Blast Fungus","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8324953,"mean":7.0165383958894,"rank":3943988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4196021,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8324953,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241576,"mean":12.3555888813,"rank":112159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":122164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241576,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":519,"mean":3.1471891891892,"rank":223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":519,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":10.9,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aston_fm\/statuses\/872065282944192512","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20852145],"posted_on":"2017-06-06T12:19:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Fiona Marshall","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000435040095\/205669034cbaa59af2b3e63f21d6b826_normal.jpeg","description":"On a mission to explore the universe of #GPCRs.","id_on_source":"aston_fm","tweeter_id":"1431366116","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":630},"tweet_id":"872065282944192512"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/grass233\/statuses\/872066679802437632","license":"gnip","rt":["aston_fm"],"citation_ids":[20852145],"posted_on":"2017-06-06T12:24:33+00:00","author":{"name":"nimura","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/846723323027324929\/1MVqkrYW_normal.png","description":"\u305d\u30fc\u305b\u3044\u6b74\u6c17\u3065\u304f\u3068\uff17\u5e74\u76ee\u304b\u306a\u3002\n\u30e4\u30af\u30eb\u30c8\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u6b74\u306f30\u5e74\u307b\u3069\u3002\n\u653f\u6cbb\u306f\u57fa\u672c\u4e2d\u5eb8\uff08\u7406\u5c48\u306b\u5408\u3046\u304b\u3069\u3046\u304b\u3001\u3060\u3051\u304c\u5224\u65ad\u57fa\u6e96\u3067\u3059\uff09","id_on_source":"grass233","tweeter_id":"134431595","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":272},"tweet_id":"872066679802437632"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/wanwanpanic\/statuses\/872066840431706112","license":"gnip","rt":["aston_fm"],"citation_ids":[20852145],"posted_on":"2017-06-06T12:25:11+00:00","author":{"name":"\u3057\u3063\u307d\u30fc","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/800974366590652416\/3zZb8LzA_normal.jpg","description":"\u305d\u30fc\u305b\u3044\u306b\u306f\u5168\u8ca1\u7523\u306e5\/3\u3092\u304b\u3051\u305f\u3093\u3060\uff01(*^\u25ef^*)\u7d4c\u7406\u4e8b\u52d9\u3084\u3063\u3066\u307e\u3059\u3002\u670d.\u9eba\u985e.\u30ab\u30ec\u30fc.\u9152\u597d\u304d\u3067\u5e02\u5185\u3092\u3046\u308d\u3046\u308d\u3002\u5f25\u751f\u4f1a\u8a08\/\u7c3f\u8a18\/\u60c5\u5831\u51e6\u7406\/\u682a\/\uff72\uff94\uff6f\uff8e\/\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30db\u30e2\/\u30cf\u30a4\u30b9\u30bf\/KEN YOKOYAMA\/\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c7\u30f3\u30dc\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\/L4D2\/maimai\/OSU-15\/ID4217-9097\/\uff7c\uff98\uff73\uff7d\u514d\u8a31SP90%DP67%","id_on_source":"wanwanpanic","tweeter_id":"110211889","geo":{"lt":34.69374,"ln":135.50218,"country":"JP"},"followers":2283},"tweet_id":"872066840431706112"}]}}
