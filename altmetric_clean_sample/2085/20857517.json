The wide variety in hRV serotypes has complicated the development of rhinovirus replication inhibitors. In the current investigation, we developed a novel series of benzothiophene derivatives and their analogues (6-8) that potently inhibit the replication of both hRV-A and hRV-B strains. Compound 6g inhibited the replication of hRV-B14, A21 and A71, with respective EC50 values of 0.083, 0.078 and 0.015 \u03bcM. The results of a time-of-addition study against hRV-B14 and hRV-A16 and resistant mutation analysis on hRV-B14 implied that 6g acts at the early stage of the viral replication process, interacting with viral capsid protein. A molecular docking study suggested that 6g has a capsid-binding mode similar to that of pleconaril. Finally, derivatives of 6 also displayed significant inhibition against poliovirus 3 (PV3) replication, implying their potential inhibitory activities against other enterovirus species.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Kim, Jinwoo","Jung, Yu Kyoung","Kim, Chonsaeng","Shin, Jin Soo","Scheers, Els","Lee, Joo-Youn","Han, Soo Bong","Lee, Chong-Kyo","Neyts, Johan","Ha, Jae-Du","Jung, Young-Sik"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jmedchem.7b00175","first_seen_on":"2017-06-06T17:35:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0022-2623","1520-4804"],"journal":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1496770477,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28581749?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28581749","pubdate":"2017-06-06T22:02:13+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society (ACS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"A Novel Series of Highly Potent Small Molecule Inhibitors of Rhinovirus Replication","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-series-highly-potent-small-molecule-inhibitors-rhinovirus-replication"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8324953,"mean":7.0165383958894,"rank":7198017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8324953,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241576,"mean":12.355551832764,"rank":196848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241576,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4048,"mean":4.4079743019521,"rank":3735,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4048,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":5.3790857142857,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
