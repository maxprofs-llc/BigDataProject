We present an implantable obesity therapy that combines gastric electrical stimulation for satiety with onboard sensors that provide self-monitoring for the patient and compliance reporting to the clinician. An algorithm for processing data from the onboard three axis accelerometer for use in physical activity monitoring was developed and validated. Four obese patients participated in a study where self-reported sleep and exercise was compared with the events detected by the implanted system, and two commercially available, wearable activity monitors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9253cf058f61000dc6b","authors":["Takami, Eri","Sanchez, Javier J","Province, Rose","Torres, Antonio J"],"doi":"10.1109\/embc.2016.7591912","first_seen_on":"2017-06-06T17:33:33+00:00","issns":["1557-170X"],"journal":"Conference proceedings Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","last_mentioned_on":1496770398,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28269449?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28269449","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IEEE","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Implantable gastric electric stimulator with automatic daily activity compliance reporting","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/implantable-gastric-electric-stimulator-automatic-daily-activity-compliance-reporting"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8395692,"mean":7.0716581022261,"rank":7257390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8395692,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244670,"mean":12.630135685354,"rank":199669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244670,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1493,"mean":1.5707774798928,"rank":976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1493,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":3,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
