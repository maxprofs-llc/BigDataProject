In this study, we explored the detection of ZIKAV antigen in a defined leucocyte subset from patient's whole blood.\nWhole blood samples were obtained at the acute and early convalescent phase from ZIKAV-infected patients during the Singapore outbreak in Aug-Sep 2016. Presence of ZIKAV antigen was determined by flow cytometry staining for intracellular ZIKAV NS3 with a ZIKAV-specific polyclonal antibody. The presence of ZIKAV antigen was determined in CD45\u00a0+\u00a0CD14+ monocytes.\nData showed that ZIKAV NS3 antigen could be detected and the levels of detection were further categorized into 3 groups-high (>40% positive), moderate (between 10-40% positive) and low (<10% positive). While majority of patients showed a decrease in the amount of ZIKAV antigen detected at later time points, some patients displayed higher levels as the disease progressed.\nOur data highlights an alternative approach in using flow cytometry for the sensitive detection of ZIKAV antigen in whole blood. Importantly, it further confirms the role of CD14+ monocytes as an important cellular target for ZIKAV infection during the viremic phase.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","authors":["Lum, Fok-Moon","Lin, Cui","Susova, Olga Y.","Teo, Teck-Hui","Fong, Siew-Wai","Mak, Tze-Minn","Lee, Linda Kay","Chong, Chia-Yin","Lye, David C.B.","Lin, Raymond T.P.","Merits, Andres","Leo, Yee-Sin","Ng, Lisa F.P."],"doi":"10.1093\/infdis\/jix276","first_seen_on":"2017-06-06T19:19:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0022-1899","1537-6613"],"journal":"Journal of Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1504713007,"links":["https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jid\/article\/3861651\/Sensitive-detection-of-Zika-virus-antigen-in","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jid\/article\/doi\/10.1093\/infdis\/jix276\/3861651\/Sensitive-detection-of-Zika-virus-antigen-in#.WTetDt1nj0w.twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28586426?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jid\/article\/doi\/10.1093\/infdis\/jix276\/3861651\/Sensitive-detection-of-Zika-virus-antigen-in#.WTiepbbX2qk.facebook","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jid\/article\/doi\/10.1093\/infdis\/jix276\/3861651\/Sensitive-detection-of-Zika-virus-antigen-in#.WTpIJ-0amss.twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jid\/article-pdf\/doi\/10.1093\/infdis\/jix276\/17661843\/jix276.pdf","pmid":"28586426","pubdate":"2017-06-07T10:08:50+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press (OUP)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Sensitive detection of Zika virus antigen in patients\u2019 whole blood as an alternative diagnostic approach","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sensitive-method-detecting-zika-virus-antigen-patients-wholeblood-specimens-alternative-diagnostic-a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17.65,"score_history":{"1y":17.65,"6m":17.65,"3m":1.35,"1m":1.35,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17.65},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8373007,"mean":7.0576589951014,"rank":497325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7875213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8373007,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243701,"mean":12.589259466557,"rank":25278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":218389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243701,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6903,"mean":6.6223381628514,"rank":379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":6523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6903,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":13.171590163934,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":12,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":12,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":6,"GB":3,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/greg_folkers\/statuses\/872171105250938880","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20859582],"posted_on":"2017-06-06T19:19:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Greg Folkers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000063259596\/220c952b0e03de1256e8135015fe9d43_normal.jpeg","description":"washington, dc || personal account || tweets\/retweets \u2260 endorsement || gregfolkers (at) yahoo (dot) com || global health\/infectious diseases","id_on_source":"greg_folkers","tweeter_id":"41626609","geo":{"lt":38.91706,"ln":-77.00025,"country":"US"},"followers":2806},"tweet_id":"872171105250938880"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Onisillos\/statuses\/872356701177040896","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20859582],"posted_on":"2017-06-07T07:36:59+00:00","author":{"name":"Onisillos Sekkides","url":"http:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/laninf\/about","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/482446447455899648\/jI6GsiZq_normal.png","description":"Deputy Editor of @TheLancetInfDis.
