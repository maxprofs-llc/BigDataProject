However, the best method of upper endoscopy for children who require gastrointestinal intervention has yet to be defined. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of the sedation induced by intravenous midazolam and ketamine during upper endoscopy in children.\nThis study included patients ages 3-18years who had undergone upper endoscopy. All subjects received IV midazolam and ketamine. During the intervention, hypoxia, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypertension, and hypotension were recorded. After the intervention, euphoria, dysphoria, vertigo, visual problems (such as diplopia and nystagmus), and emergencies (such as arrhythmia, convulsion, and hallucination), among other findings, were recorded. Older children who were capable of expressing themselves were questioned to help determine these conditions.\nThe mean age of the study group was was 11.9\u00b13.42years; 54% of the patients were females, and 46% were males. During the upper endoscopy, hypoxia occurred in 9% of patients, mild hypertension in 14%, hypotension in 5%, tachycardia in 23%, bradycardia in 8%, and flushing-urticaria in 2%. After the upper endoscopy, one of the most common complications was sore throat, which occurred in 24% of patients. Vomiting was observed in 14% of patients, dizziness in 24%, diplopia in 27%, euphoria in 3% (5 patients), dysphoria in 4%, and hallucination in 4%. Of the total patients, 4% required oxygen supply with a face mask.\nThe results of our study showed that the use of IV midazolam and ketamine during upper endoscopy in children was safe and effective.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006abf","authors":["Basturk, Ahmet","Artan, Reha","Y\u0131lmaz, Aygen"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajg.2017.05.004","first_seen_on":"2017-06-06T17:36:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1687-1979","2090-2387"],"journal":"Arab Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1496770570,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28579345?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28579345","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Efficacy and safety of midazolam and ketamine in paediatric upper endoscopy","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8324953,"mean":7.0165383958894,"rank":7198017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8324953,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241576,"mean":12.35555493739,"rank":196848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241576,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167,"mean":1.4765662650602,"rank":151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.0583333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/872145101207687168","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20857540],"posted_on":"2017-06-06T17:36:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
