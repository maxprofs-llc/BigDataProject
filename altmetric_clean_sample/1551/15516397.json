Novel knowledge on the biology of cancer has evidenced that genetic changes occurring within cancer cells contribute, but are not sufficient, for tumor promotion and progression. The results of clinical studies and experimental animal models have suggested pursuing new avenues for the prevention of cancer development in the early stages, by using drugs that modulate platelet responses and those interfering with the synthesis and action of the mediators of inflammation. In fact, malignant tumors often develop at sites of chronic injury associated with platelet activation and chronic inflammation. In this review, we cover the evidence supporting this hypothesis and the rationale for the pharmacological treatment with antiplatelet agents, including low-dose aspirin, and antiinflammatory drugs to curb tumorigenesis and malignant progression. The evidence for a chemopreventive effect of low-dose aspirin against colorectal cancer (CRC) has been recently found appropriate by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which recommends the use of the drug for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and CRC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036f0","authors":["Melania Dovizio","Angela Sacco","Paola Patrignani"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vph.2017.01.003","first_seen_on":"2017-01-16T10:09:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["15371891","1879-3649"],"journal":"Vascular Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1484561299,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S153718911630355X"],"pmid":"28089842","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Curbing tumorigenesis and malignant progression through the pharmacological control of the wound healing process","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/curbing-tumorigenesis-malignant-progression-through-pharmacological-control-wound-healing-process"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8076231,"mean":6.8570644748779,"rank":6133151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1084369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8076231,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257997,"mean":12.845483953239,"rank":185761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":44878,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257997,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184,"mean":3.8261857923497,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.95,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
