Thematic analyses show that guest and occupancy policies that enforce the \"single\" nature of single-adult supportive housing challenge consumer rights to self-determination in the realm of social recovery. Findings also highlight the ways in which providers act to reinforce and subvert these policies while mitigating risk in this service setting. Recommendations for enhancing the recovery orientation of supportive housing and implications for the design of the homeless service system are discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002178","authors":["Emmy Tiderington"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10488-016-0780-z","first_seen_on":"2017-01-16T01:35:51+00:00","issns":["1573-3289","0894-587X"],"journal":"Administration & Policy in Mental Health & Mental Health Services Research","last_mentioned_on":1501866305,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10488-016-0780-z","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10488-016-0780-z","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10488-016-0780-z"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10488-016-0780-z.pdf","pmid":"27900616","pubdate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Administration","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Informatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["healthservices","psychology"],"title":"\u201cThe Apartment is for You, It\u2019s Not for Anyone Else\u201d: Managing Social Recovery and Risk on the Frontlines of Single-Adult Supportive Housing","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/apartment-not-anyone-else-managing-social-recovery-risk-frontlines-singleadult-supportive-housing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":2,"3m":2,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":2127693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5057303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274815,"mean":12.556568246159,"rank":94740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":175250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274815,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312,"mean":4.5580128617363,"rank":106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":33.481428571429,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Social Sciences":2,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1,"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nick_kerman\/statuses\/820806654442827776","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15510438],"posted_on":"2017-01-16T01:35:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Nick Kerman","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Nick_Kerman","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/538773901405192193\/LUuUttsI_normal.jpeg","description":"PhD Candidate (clinical psychology);
