Lighter gas abuse-related death is still an important health problem in Turkey. In this study, 25,265 case files and final reports submitted to the Institute of Forensic Medicine of the First Specialization Board between January 2011 and December 2015 were evaluated retrospectively. In 56 of these cases, lighter gas inhalation (n-butane, propane, isobutane) was recorded as the cause of death. All subjects were male with a mean age of 16.8years. According to eyewitness and crime scene investigation reports, in 48 (85.7%) of the cases, a lighter refill container was found at the scene. It was determined that 21.4% of the cases used a plastic bag to increase the effects of lighter gas and 76.8% inhaled the lighter gas via their mouth and nose. The toxicological analysis of the samples taken while hospitalized showed no lighter refill components (n-butane, propane, isobutane) in 66% of the cases, n-butane in 32.1% of the cases, and n-butane+propane+isobutane in 1.9% of the cases. The importance of lighter gas inhalation-related deaths in Turkey has been increasing. Strict measures against the abuse of these very dangerous substances should be undertaken by the mutual efforts of medical specialists and legislators.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f83cf058f610002ffa","authors":["\u00d6zdemir, Erdin\u00e7","E\u015f, H\u00fcseyin","Demir, Muhammet","\u00dcz\u00fcn, \u0130brahim"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.legalmed.2016.10.008","endpage":"6","first_seen_on":"2017-01-16T03:55:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-4162","13446223"],"journal":"Legal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1487084546,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28081784"],"pmid":"28081784","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["jurisprudence"],"title":"Forensic medical evaluation of deaths resulting from inhalation of cigarette lighter refill fuel in Turkey","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/forensic-medical-evaluation-deaths-resulting-inhalation-cigarette-lighter-refill-fuel-turkey"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8208063,"mean":6.9506291146371,"rank":3845502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4329791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8208063,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265763,"mean":12.747041247431,"rank":126888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":137050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265763,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228,"mean":2.3545462555066,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Computer Science":1,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":3}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Hlth_Literacy\/statuses\/820841779431874560","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15511783],"posted_on":"2017-01-16T03:55:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Health Literacy","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/731064960\/LiteracyII_normal.jpg","description":"Eclectic health info, Health Literacy  Also @HIV_Insight @Prison_Health, @Why_We_Do_That, @Sex_Worker_Hlth","id_on_source":"Hlth_Literacy","tweeter_id":"77314206","geo":{"lt":21.30694,"ln":-157.85833,"country":"US"},"followers":6036},"tweet_id":"820841779431874560"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Why_We_Do_That\/statuses\/820841781508145152","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15511783],"posted_on":"2017-01-16T03:55:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Why_We_Do_That","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/779459146\/Rorschach_4_normal.jpg","description":"Psychology; how, why & what not.
