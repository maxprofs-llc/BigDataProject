The genome-wide significance level was set to p < 5 \u00d7 10(-8).\nWe identified nearly genome-wide significant associations in CLASP1, PDE11A, KCNMB2, TGFA, SLC38A6 and MMP16. The strongest association was with rs62151109 in CLASP1 (odds ratio: 3.97; p = 9.44 \u00d7 10(-8)). All top hits except two were located in intronic or noncoding DNA regions. None of the candidate genes were significantly associated in our study.\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough is potentially associated with genes that are independent of bradykinin pathways.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f6100084da","authors":["P\u00e4r Hallberg","Matilda Persson","Tomas Axelsson","Marco Cavalli","Pia Norling","Hans-Erik Johansson","Qun-Ying Yue","Patrik KE Magnusson","Claes Wadelius","Niclas Eriksson","Mia Wadelius"],"doi":"10.2217\/pgs-2016-0184","first_seen_on":"2017-01-16T12:26:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-8042","1462-2416"],"journal":"Pharmacogenomics","last_mentioned_on":1485453942,"links":["http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/doi\/full\/10.2217\/pgs-2016-0184","http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/doi\/abs\/10.2217\/pgs-2016-0184?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed"],"pmid":"28084903","pubdate":"2017-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical","pharmacology"],"title":"Genetic variants associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough: a genome-wide association study in a Swedish population","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/doi\/10.2217\/pgs-2016-0184","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-variants-associated-angiotensinconverting-enzyme-inhibitorinduced-cough-genomewide-associati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082038,"mean":6.8946982576228,"rank":4263846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2251738,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082038,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260822,"mean":12.814546903815,"rank":148063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":87084,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260822,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":601,"mean":3.1427133333333,"rank":333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":601,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.025,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
