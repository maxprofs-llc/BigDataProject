The effect size was calculated as event rates (95% confidence interval [CI]), with homogeneity testing using Cochran's Q and I(2) statistics. Meta-regression was used to test the impact of study-level covariates (HPV detection method, geographic origin) on effect size. Potential publication bias was estimated using funnel plot symmetry.\nOne hundred seventy nine studies were eligible, comprising a sample size of 7,347 LSCCs from different geographic regions. Altogether, 1,830 (25%) cases tested HPV-positive considering all methods, with effect size of 0.269 (95% CI: 0.242 to 0.297; random-effects model). In meta-analysis stratified by the 1) HPV detection technique and 2) geographic study origin, the between-study heterogeneity was significant only for geographic origin (P = .0001). In meta-regression, the HPV detection method (P = .876) or geographic origin (P = .234) were not significant study-level covariates. Some evidence for publication bias was found only for studies from North America and those using non-polymerase chain reaction methods, with a marginal effect on adjusted point estimates for both.\nVariability in HPV detection rates in LSCC is explained by geographic origin of study but not by HPV detection method. However, they were not significant study-level covariates in formal meta-regression.\nNA Laryngoscope, 2015.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005aee","authors":["Gama, Ricardo Ribeiro Gama","Carvalho, Andr\u00e9 Lopes","Longatto Filho, Adhemar","Scorsato, Anderson Paulo","Mendoza Lopez, Rossana  V.","Rautava, Jaana","Syrjanen, Stina","Syrjanen, Kari","Ricardo Ribeiro Gama","Andr\u00e9 Lopes Carvalho","Adhemar Longatto Filho","Anderson Paulo Scorsato","Rossana V.
