The Australasian Vascular Anomalies Network and the Australasian Paediatric Dermatology Network have developed a consensus statement for the treatment of infantile haemangiomas with oral propranolol. Infants with haemangiomas that are life threatening, at risk of ulceration, or at risk of causing a significant functional impairment, psychological impact or physical deformity should be treated early with oral propranolol. Oral propranolol is safe and effective and in most healthy infants oral propranolol can be started in an outpatient setting.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002358","authors":["Smithson, Sarah L","Rademaker, Marius","Adams, Susan","Bade, Stuart","Bekhor, Philip","Davidson, Samantha","Dore, Amanda","Drummond, Catherine","Fischer, Gayle","Gin, Alexander","Grills, Claire","Halbert, Anne","Lokmic, Zerina","McCahon, Emma","Morgan, Vanessa A","Murrell, Dedee F","Orchard, David","Penington, Anthony","Purvis, Diana","Relic, John","Robertson, Susan","Robinson, Aaron J","Scardamaglia, Laura","Su, John","Tan, Swee","Wargon, Orli","Warren, Lachlan","Wong, Li\u2010chuen","Zappala, Tania","Phillips, Roderic","Sarah L Smithson","Marius Rademaker","Susan Adams","Stuart Bade","Philip Bekhor","Samantha Davidson","Amanda Dore","Catherine Drummond","Gayle Fischer","Alexander Gin","Claire Grills","Anne Halbert","Zerina Lokmic","Emma McCahon","Vanessa A Morgan","Dedee F Murrell","David Orchard","Anthony Penington","Diana Purvis","John Relic","Susan Robertson","Aaron J Robinson","Laura Scardamaglia","John Su","Swee Tan","Orli Wargon","Lachlan Warren","Li-chuen Wong","Tania Zappala","Roderic Phillips"],"doi":"10.1111\/ajd.12600","endpage":"159","first_seen_on":"2017-03-06T08:36:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00048380","1440-0960"],"issue":"2","journal":"Australasian Journal of Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1492593247,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ajd.12600\/abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28251611?dopt=Citation","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/ajd.12600"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ajd.12600\/pdf","pmid":"28251611","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"155","subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Consensus statement for the treatment of infantile haemangiomas with propranolol","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/ajd.12600","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/consensus-statement-treatment-infantile-haemangiomas-propranolol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8420525,"mean":7.0854310083228,"rank":4000023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4233745,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8420525,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243751,"mean":13.717981185641,"rank":119156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":117420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243751,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":392,"mean":3.4480818414322,"rank":164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":392,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":6.0307692307692,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DermatologyNews\/statuses\/838669453785239552","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17041822],"posted_on":"2017-03-06T08:35:54+00:00","author":{"name":"DermatologyNews","url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/KOM-DermNews","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1438130731\/KOM_normal.JPG","description":"Newsletter for scientific information on Dermatology","id_on_source":"DermatologyNews","tweeter_id":"75478054","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":6655},"tweet_id":"838669453785239552"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HecovanNijmegen\/statuses\/854624136836116480","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17041822],"posted_on":"2017-04-19T09:14:07+00:00","author":{"name":"C. van der Vleuten","url":"http:\/\/www.hecovan.nl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2241711031\/gty_strawberry_stain_jp_110621_wg_normal.jpg","description":"Vasculair dermatoloog | aangeboren vaatafwijkingen | hemangioom | ISSVA | Hevas | SKTN | Principal Clinician @ Radboudumc | Keeping the \u2696 by \ud83d\udeb4\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f","id_on_source":"HecovanNijmegen","tweeter_id":"587810817","geo":{"lt":51.8425,"ln":5.85278,"country":"NL"},"followers":246},"tweet_id":"854624136836116480"}]}}
