Sublingual administration is a potential alternative, but its feasibility and effectiveness compared with oral route has not been established.\nTo compare tacrolimus drug exposure after sublingual and oral administration in liver transplant recipients.\nExperimental, open-label, non-randomised, cross-over study. Tacrolimus exposure was evaluated in 32 liver transplant recipients receiving oral administration. 12 h tacrolimus area-under-the-curve (AUC0-12 h ) was calculated using tacrolimus blood concentrations at 0-0.5-1-2-4-6-8-12 hrs post-dose. Recipients were switched to sublingual administration, and dose was adjusted to reach similar trough levels, new AUC0-12 h was calculated. Correlation between AUC0-12 h and trough levels was determined for both oral and sublingual phases.\nSimilar trough levels were accomplished with oral and sublingual administration (6.68 \u00b1 2 ng\/mL vs. 6.62 \u00b1 1.9 ng\/mL (P = 0.8)). Although concentration 2 h post dose was higher in oral phase (15.36 \u00b1 7.14 vs. 13.18 \u00b1 5.64, P = 0.015), AUC0-12 h was similar in both phases (116.6 \u00b1 34.6 vs. 111.5 \u00b1 36.93 ng\/mL* h, P = 0.19). Daily dose of tacrolimus required in sublingual phase was 37% lower than that used in oral phase (P < 0.0001), suggesting significantly increased bioavailability of tacrolimus when employing sublingual route. Good correlation between AUC0-12 h and trough levels was observed in sublingual phase (r(2) = 0.74). Twenty-two recipients were maintained on sublingual administration after the end of study (mean follow-up: 18.7 \u00b1 5.8 months). No difference in liver function tests or rejection rates was found during follow-up period.\nSublingual administration of tacrolimus is feasible and provides similar drug exposure compared with oral administration. In our study, at long-term follow-up, sublingual administration was not associated with liver transplant rejection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021d1","authors":["Solari, S.","Cancino, A.","Wolff, R.","Norero, B.","Vargas, J.
