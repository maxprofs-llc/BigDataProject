The efficacy of the therapy was assessed based on the data of clinico-neurological, instrumental, and immunological examinations before and after the treatment and evaluated in terms of the dynamics of the neurological state of the patients, EEG features, and immunological data (including the content of proinflammatory IL-1 beta cytokine and antiinflammatory IL-4 cytokine in the blood serum). Based on a comparison of the results obtained in patients receiving traditional antiepileptic drugs with and without mexidol, it is possible to recommend the complex treatment involving mexidol for the therapy of patients suffering of the postraumatic epilepsy. Mexidol provides for an additional immunocorrection and enhances the effect of antiepileptic drugs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000cf00","authors":["Novikov, V E","Maslova, N N"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-23T17:50:37+00:00","issns":["0869-2092"],"issue":"4","journal":"Eksperimental naia i klinicheskaia farmakologiia","last_mentioned_on":1500670846,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/14558343\/"],"pmid":"14558343","pubdate":"2003-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"[Effect of mexidol on the course of post-traumatic epilepsy].","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-mexidol-course-posttraumatic-epilepsy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250684,"mean":6.9709404952229,"rank":7136074,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250684,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163108,"mean":11.530650505496,"rank":132843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163108,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122,"mean":1.486347107438,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"reddit":[{"title":"Effect of mexidol on the course of post-traumatic epilepsy.2003","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EpilepsySupplements\/comments\/6oqtid\/effect_of_mexidol_on_the_course_of_posttraumatic\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[22293306],"posted_on":"2017-07-21T21:00:46+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"spyderspyders"}}]}}
