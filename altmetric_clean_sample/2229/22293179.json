The enthalpy-pressure (H-P) diagrams indicate that the structural transition sequence of MgH2 is \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b4 \u2192 \u03b5 \u2192 \u03b6 phase and NbH2 transforms from the Fm-3m phase to the Pnma phase at 47.80 GPa. However, MgNbH2 is unstable when the pressure is too low or too high. Two novel MgNbH2 structures, the hexagonal P-6m2 phase and the orthorhombic Cmcm phase, are discovered, which are stable in the pressure ranges of 13.24-128.27 GPa and 128.27-186.77 GPa, respectively. The P-6m2 phase of MgNbH2 consists of alternate layers of polymetric NbH6 and MgH6 triangular prisms while the Cmcm phase contains distorted MgH6 trigonal prisms. The calculated elastic constants and phonon dispersions confirm that both phases are mechanically and dynamically stable. The analyses of density of states (DOS), electron localization function (ELF) and Bader charge demonstrate that a combination of ionic and metallic bonds exist in both P-6m2 and Cmcm phases. We hope the newly predicted magnesium niobium dihydrides with desirable electronic properties will promote future experimental and theoretical studies on mixed main group-transition metal hydrides.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Chuan-Zhao Zhang","Guoliang Sun","Jingjing Wang","Cheng Lu","Yuan-Yuan Jin","Xiaoyu Kuang","Andreas Hermann"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsami.7b06143","first_seen_on":"2017-07-23T17:35:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1944-8244","1944-8252"],"journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1500831317,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsami.7b06143?mi=4fdvukg&af=R&CollectionKey=10.1555\/category.358319432&target=collection&targetTab=std"],"pmid":"28707468","publisher":" American Chemical Society ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
