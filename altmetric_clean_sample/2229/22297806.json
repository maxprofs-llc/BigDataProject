Membrane hyperpolarization increases response to the full agonist acetylcholine (ACh) while decreasing response to the partial agonist pilocarpine. We previously have demonstrated that the regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) 4 protein discriminates between the voltage-dependent responses of ACh and pilocarpine; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we show that RGS4 is involved in the voltage-dependent behavior of the M2 muscarinic receptor-mediated signaling in response to pilocarpine. Additionally we revealed structural determinants on the M2 muscarinic receptor underlying the voltage-dependent response. By electrophysiological recording in Xenopus oocytes expressing M2 muscarinic receptor and G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K(+) channels, we quantified voltage-dependent desensitization of pilocarpine-induced current in the presence or absence of RGS4. Hyperpolarization-induced desensitization of the current required for RGS4, also depended on pilocarpine concentration. Mutations of charged residues in the aspartic acid-arginine-tyrosine motif of the M2 muscarinic receptor, but not intracellular loop 3, significantly impaired the voltage-dependence of RGS4 function. Thus, our results demonstrated that voltage-dependence of RGS4 modulation is derived from the M2 muscarinic receptor. These results provide novel insights into how membrane potential impacts G-protein signaling by modulating GPCR communication with downstream effectors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Chen, I-Shan","Furutani, Kazuharu","Kurachi, Yoshihisa","I-Shan Chen","Kazuharu Furutani","Yoshihisa Kurachi"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-05128-z","first_seen_on":"2017-07-24T03:54:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1500870555,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28733581?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-05128-z","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28733581?dopt=Abstractu0026utm_source=dlvr.itu0026utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-05128-z.pdf","pmid":"28733581","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","startpage":"6110","subjects":["science"],"title":"Structural determinants at the M2 muscarinic receptor modulate the RGS4-GIRK response to pilocarpine by impairment of the receptor voltage sensitivity","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-determinants-m2-muscarinic-receptor-modulate-rgs4girk-response-pilocarpine-impairment-rec"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":4155913,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3899186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168861,"mean":11.501101018595,"rank":83334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":78123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168861,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35507,"mean":14.760090519912,"rank":18863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":15030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35507,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3247,"mean":12.322601355514,"rank":1612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":1501,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3247,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
