Among them, there are three tapeworm species of outstanding importance: Echinococcus granulosus, E. multilocularis, and Taenia solium, which are responsible for cystic echinococcosis, alveolar echinococcosis, and cysticercosis, respectively. Despite several attempts, there is still a need for an effective and low-cost serological diagnostic test that can be used in endemic countries. In the present work, we described an innovative bioinformatic workflow for a rational prediction of putative peptide candidates for one-step serological diagnosis of any of these infections. First, we predicted the theoretical secretome shared by the three tapeworms starting from their full reported proteomes. Then, through immunoinformatics, we identified proteins within the shared secretome displaying high antigenicity scores and bearing T cell epitopes able to bind most human MHC-II alleles. Secondly, in such proteins, we identified linear B cell epitopes without post-translational modifications, and mapped them on 3D modelled structures to visualize their antibody accessibilities. As a result, we finally suggested two antigenic peptides shared between the secretomes of the three parasite species, which could be further tested for their immunodiagnostic potential.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ac3","authors":["Miles, Sebasti\u00e1n","Navatta, Marco","Dematteis, Sylvia","Mourglia-Ettlin, Gustavo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.meegid.2017.07.020","first_seen_on":"2017-07-23T15:27:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1567-1348","1567-7257"],"journal":"Infection, Genetics & Evolution","last_mentioned_on":1500823627,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28728879?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28728879","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","communicablediseases","genetics"],"title":"Identification of universal diagnostic peptide candidates for neglected tropical diseases caused by cestodes through the integration of multi-genome-wide analyses and immunoinformatic predictions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-universal-diagnostic-peptide-candidates-neglected-tropical-diseases-caused-cestodes-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8261251,"mean":6.9754429808982,"rank":7144916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8261251,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168318,"mean":11.549495511446,"rank":137301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168318,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1310,"mean":2.291640947288,"rank":1012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1310,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.6893939393939,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
