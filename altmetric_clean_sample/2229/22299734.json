Topological indices were used as structural descriptors and their relation to antimicrobial activity was determined by using linear discriminant analysis. This topological model establishes new structure activity relationships which show that the presence of cyclopropyl, chlorine and ramification pairs at a distance of two bonds favor this activity, while the presence of tertiary amines decreases it. This model was applied to a combinatorial library of a thousand and one 6-fluoroquinolones, from which 117 theoretical active molecules were obtained. The compound 10 and five new quinolones were tested against MRSA. They all showed some activity against MRSA, although compounds 6, 8 and 9 showed anti-MRSA activity similar to ciprofloxacin. This model was also applied to 263 theoretical antibacterial agents described by us in a previous work, from which 34 were predicted as theoretically active. Anti-MRSA activity was found bibliographically in 9 of them (ensuring at least 26% of success), and from the rest, 3 compounds were randomly chosen and tested, finding mitomycin C to be more active than ciprofloxacin. The results demonstrate the utility of the molecular topology approaches for identifying new drugs active against MRSA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000283d","authors":["Bueso-Bordils, Jose I.","Perez-Gracia, Maria T.","Suay-Garcia, Beatriz","Duart, Maria J.","Martin Algarra, Rafael V.","Lahuerta Zamora, Luis","Anton-Fos, Gerardo M.","Aleman Lopez, Pedro A."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejmech.2017.07.010","first_seen_on":"2017-07-24T06:45:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0223-5234","1768-3254"],"journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1500878712,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28734246?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28734246","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Topological pattern for the search of new active drugs against methicillin resistant  Staphylococcus aureus","type":"article","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/topological-pattern-search-new-active-drugs-against-methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":6271797,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1117335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168864,"mean":11.50094317879,"rank":118793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168864,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1148,"mean":1.8534507410636,"rank":562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1148,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":2.6257142857143,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
