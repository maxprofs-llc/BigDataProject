The calculated energies were then verified by MP4 and CCSD(T). A four-formula cluster (M2CO3)4, M = Li, Na, and K was used to describe the molten carbonate. It was found that the adsorption of oxygen to molten carbonate is of chemical type and leads to the formation of CO52- in MC, which was confirmed for the first time by DFT calculations. The energy barrier for its dissociation is calculated to be 197.9, 116.7, and 170.3 kJ\/mol in the (M2CO3)4 cluster, M = Li, Na, and K, respectively. If the reaction of O2 + 2CO32- \u2192 2CO42- is approximated as a one-step reaction, the activation energy is estimated to be 96.2, 15.1, and 68.6 kJ\/mol, respectively. The reaction rate is of the first order to the pressure of oxygen. Surprisingly, the reaction of oxygen dissociation has the lowest energy barrier in sodium carbonate, which is consistent to the recent experimental findings. It is very clear that the molten carbonate salt has directly participated in the ORR process and plays an important role as a catalyst in the cathode of SOFCs. The oxygen reduction has been facilitated by MC and enhanced cell performance has been observed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","authors":["Xueling Lei"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpca.5b06527","first_seen_on":"2015-08-07T21:19:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5215"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry A","last_mentioned_on":1438982347,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jpca.5b06527"],"pmid":"26219024","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atomic, Molecular, Nuclear, Particle And Plasma Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
