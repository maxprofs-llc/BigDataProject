Salivary cortisol concentration (SCC) was used to measure physiology of distress and to analyze the short- and long-term effects of TYP. Psychological distress was evaluated by applying a specific perceived stress questionnaire (PSQ). Results (mean\u00b1standard deviation) were analyzed by Wilcoxon test (p<0.05).\nSCC decreased 24% after the first (0.66\u00b10.20\u2009\u03bcg\/dL versus 0.50\u00b10.13\u2009\u03bcg\/dL) and last (1.01\u00b10.37 versus 0.76\u00b10.31\u2009\u03bcg\/dL) sessions, showing the short-term effect of yoga. Long-term effects were analyzed by daily rhythm of cortisol production. In the beginning, volunteers showed altered SCC during the day, with nighttime values (0.42\u00b10.28) higher than those at noon (0.30\u00b10.06). After the TYP, SCC was higher in the morning (1.01\u00b10.37) and decreased during the day, with lower values before sleep (0.30\u00b10.13). The TYP was also efficient to reduce PSQ scores (0.45\u00b10.13 versus 0.39\u00b10.07). Specifically, the irritability, tension, and fatigue domains on the PSQ decreased (0.60\u00b10.20 versus 0.46\u00b10.13), as did the fear and anxiety domains (0.54\u00b10.30 versus 0.30\u00b10.20).\nOver the short term, TYP led to the decrease of cortisol production. Over the long term, TYP induced higher cortisol production in the morning and lower production in the evening. Those effects contributed to the physical and mental well-being of the participants.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c79","authors":["Batista, Janir Coutinho","Souza, Agl\u00e9cio Luiz","Ferreira, Heloisa Aparecida","Canova, Fernando","Grassi-Kassisse, Dora Maria"],"doi":"10.1089\/acm.2014.0383","endpage":"685","first_seen_on":"2015-08-10T10:06:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-7708","1075-5535"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Alternative & Complementary Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1472295617,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26248115","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/acm.2014.0383","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26248115?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26248115","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"681","subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Acute and Chronic Effects of Tantric Yoga Practice on Distress Index","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acute-chronic-effects-tantric-yoga-practice-distress-index"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8286032,"mean":6.9859461464656,"rank":5991430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1999199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8286032,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229867,"mean":8.7017168089235,"rank":144399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":71528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229867,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1564,"mean":13.148634676903,"rank":1241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1564,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":83.072205128205,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":5},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":2,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Salimetrics\/statuses\/630681634870808578","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4379701],"posted_on":"2015-08-10T10:06:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Salimetrics","url":"http:\/\/www.salimetrics.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2839631539\/bff73d8854f646935c133c5e1bc516d6_normal.jpeg","description":"Undisputed World Leader in Salivary Bioscience, Saliva Testing, Saliva Collection...Simple, Painless, Effective..... http:\/\/www.salimetrics.com","id_on_source":"Salimetrics","tweeter_id":"557624470","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":532},"tweet_id":"630681634870808578"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/_medjournal\/statuses\/769489706660859904","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4379701],"posted_on":"2016-08-27T11:00:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Internet Medical","url":"http:\/\/medjournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1096739216\/101203760_normal.jpg","description":"The Internet Medical Journal","id_on_source":"_medjournal","tweeter_id":"164579558","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":4538},"tweet_id":"769489706660859904"}]}}
