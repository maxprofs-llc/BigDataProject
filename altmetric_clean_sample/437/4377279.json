Osteonecrosis (ON) of bone is one of these treatment-related effects with a\u00a0multifactorial pathogenesis. In the past few years, several polymorphisms of candidate genes with possible role in development of this disorder were studied.We summarized potential risk factors leading to increased susceptibility to osteonecrosis of bone development in cancer patients during childhood and to present current knowledge in the field of genetic aspects of this condition (Ref. 86).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9173cf058f61000d102","authors":["Geczova, L","Soltysova, A","Gecz, J","Sufliarska, S","Horakova, J","Mladosievicova, B"],"first_seen_on":"2015-08-09T05:37:56+00:00","issns":["0006-9248"],"issue":"5","journal":"Bratislavsk\u00e9 lek\u00e1rske listy","last_mentioned_on":1439098653,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25924637?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25924637","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Avascular necrosis of bone in childhood cancer patients: a possible role of genetic susceptibility.","type":"article","volume":"116","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/avascular-necrosis-bone-childhood-cancer-patients-possible-role-genetic-susceptibility"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5462004,"mean":6.3513590516133,"rank":4544217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5462004,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190758,"mean":8.928579931536,"rank":153036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190758,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172,"mean":1.855216374269,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/status\/630251548463894528","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4377279],"posted_on":"2015-08-09T05:37:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":407},"tweet_id":"630251548463894528"}]}}
