The aim of this study was to examine the rate of osseointegration in animal models and to further investigate the stability for implants with SLAffinity-treated surface in the clinical trial.\nImplants were installed in the mandibular canine-premolar area of 12 miniature pigs. Each pig received 2 implants with the same shapes but with different chemical surfaces. In the clinical trial, 25 patients were included. Each patient received 1 SLAffinity-treated implant on the posterior area of either arch. Resonance frequency analysis and computed tomography were assessed weekly over the first 12 weeks after implant placement.\nThe results found that surface treatment did affect the bone-to-implant contact (BIC) significantly. Comparison of BIC at 3 weeks in animal study showed that the SLAffinity-treated implants presented significantly higher values than machine surface implants. SLAffinity-treated implants also proved clinically successful through 12 months, ready for prosthodontic restoration.\nThe effect of SLAffinity treatments enhanced osseointegration significantly, especially at early stages of bone healing. Clinical trial finding, furthermore, ensured that the SLAffinity treatment was a reliable surface modification alternative.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f45","authors":["Huang, Mao-Suan","Chen, Li-Kai","Ou, Keng-Liang","Cheng, Han-Yi","Wang, Che-Shun"],"doi":"10.1097\/id.0000000000000258","first_seen_on":"2015-08-08T23:48:38+00:00","issns":["1538-2982","1056-6163"],"issue":"4","journal":"Implant Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1439077697,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/implantdent\/Abstract\/2015\/08000\/Rapid_Osseointegration_of_Titanium_Implant_With.14.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/implantdent\/2015\/08000\/Rapid_Osseointegration_of_Titanium_Implant_With.14.pdf","pmid":"25946663","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"441","subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Rapid Osseointegration of Titanium Implant With Innovative Nanoporous Surface Modification: Animal Model and Clinical Trial","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rapid-osseointegration-titanium-implant-innovative-nanoporous-surface-modification-animal-model-clin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5461682,"mean":6.3512561583122,"rank":3843508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":917783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5461682,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191520,"mean":8.9015556889917,"rank":132538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":37938,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191520,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":861,"mean":0.87395348837209,"rank":300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":861,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.0134615384615,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
