Despite mounting research on ovarian toxicity, there is paucity of data regarding reliable biomarkers of testicular toxicity. Our aim was to evaluate AMH as a marker for chemotherapy-induced testicular toxicity. Serum AMH and a panel of gonadal hormones were measured in male cancer patients at baseline and post-chemotherapy. In the preclinical setting, mice were injected with diverse chemotherapies and were sacrificed 1 week or 1\/3\/6 months later. We evaluated spermatogenesis by AMH, as well as qualitative and quantitative sperm parameters. Nineteen patients were enrolled, median age was 38y (21-44y). Serum AMH was correlated with increased FSH and testosterone and decreased inhibin-B in gonadotoxic protocols (cisplatin or busulfan), and remained unchanged in non-gonadotoxic protocols (capecitabine). AMH Expression had the same pattern in mice serum and testes; it was negatively correlated with testicular\/epididymal weight and sperm motility. The increase in testicular AMH expression was also correlated with elevated apoptosis (TUNEL) and reduced proliferation (Ki67, PCNA; All seminiferous tubules cells were analyzed). Severely damaged mice testes demonstrated a marked co-staining of AMH and GATA-4, a Sertoli-cell marker; staining that resembled the pattern of Sertoli-cell only condition. Our study indicates that the pattern of serum AMH expression, in combination with other hormones, can delineate testicular damage, as determined in both experimental settings. Future large-scale clinical studies are warranted to further define the role of AMH as a biomarker for testicular-toxicity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f610007282","authors":["Levi, Mattan","Hasky, Noa","Stemmer, Solomon M","Shalgi, Ruth","Ben-Aharon, Irit"],"doi":"10.1210\/en.2015-1310","first_seen_on":"2015-08-08T10:23:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1945-7170"],"journal":"Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1439029953,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26252060?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26252060","pubdate":"2015-08-08T22:00:20+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone is a marker for chemotherapy-induced testicular toxicity.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antim%C3%BCllerian-hormone-marker-chemotherapyinduced-testicular-toxicity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5462004,"mean":6.3513590516133,"rank":3843662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":917904,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5462004,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191634,"mean":8.8977503874595,"rank":132587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":37966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191634,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2369,"mean":3.7683826013513,"rank":1751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2369,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":5.6651111111111,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/status\/629961031679250432","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4375077],"posted_on":"2015-08-08T10:23:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"629961031679250432"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ovPCD_papers\/status\/629963402387963904","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4375077],"posted_on":"2015-08-08T10:32:33+00:00","author":{"name":"ovaryPCDpapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/622551872801378304\/GQKixh8k_normal.jpg","description":"Feed of scientific papers on ovary\/oogenesis\/oocyte programmed cell death (PCD).
