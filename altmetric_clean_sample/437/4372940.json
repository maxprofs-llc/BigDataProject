Therefore it is very important to confirm the factors that affect the possibility of suicidal behavior.\nThe survey included 200 respondents; 100 heroin addicts on the substitution program that attempted suicide and 100 opiate addicts who have not attempted suicide. The evaluation included a questionnaire with socio-demographic, hereditary and addiction data, legal problems and then the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-MMPI-2.\nThe results showed a statistically significant difference compared to the personality structure, especially pronounced in hypersensitive structures, in relation to the duration of addictive experience and duration of heroin by intravenous route, as well as in relation to the presence of psychotic disorders, drug abuse and suicidal behavior in the family.\nAs risk factors among opiate addicts are indentified interfered biological and psychological factors and the effects of the substances themselves.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041bb","authors":["Tatjana Dragisic","Aleksandra Dickov","Veselin Dickov","Vesna Mijatovic"],"doi":"10.5455\/msm.2015.27.188-191","first_seen_on":"2015-08-07T15:06:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1512-7680"],"issue":"3","journal":"Materia Socio Medica","last_mentioned_on":1483157530,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4499285\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4499285\/?report=classic","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4499285\/"],"pmid":"26236166","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AVICENA, d.o.o.","startpage":"188","title":"Drug Addiction as Risk for Suicide Attempts","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/drug-addiction-risk-suicide-attempts-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":70.35,"score_history":{"1y":65,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":70.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8033474,"mean":6.8137589672577,"rank":119555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7913880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8033474,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229481,"mean":8.541575570856,"rank":4888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":224586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229481,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":3.5256818181818,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
