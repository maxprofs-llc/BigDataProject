The Population Care Coordination Process provides a framework for each provider and\/or organization to provide multilevel care based on population- and patient-centered principles.\nThe Population Care Coordination Process is scalable. It can be utilized in a smaller scale such as single provider office or in a larger scale such as an accountable care organization.\nThere are many issues within our current health care structure that must be addressed. Care coordination has been identified as a potential solution to address the needs of complex patients within the system. The expansion to consider populations allows for a more targeted and efficient approach.\nThe population care process entails a data-driven approach to care coordination. The inclusion of populations in the care coordination process provides an opportunity to maximize efforts and improve outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c57","authors":["Rushton, Sharron"],"doi":"10.1097\/ncm.0000000000000105","endpage":"238","first_seen_on":"2015-08-09T22:56:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-8095","1932-8087"],"issue":"5","journal":"Professional case management","last_mentioned_on":1499616850,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/professionalcasemanagementjournal\/Abstract\/2015\/09000\/The_Population_Care_Coordination_Process.4.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/professionalcasemanagementjournal\/2015\/09000\/The_Population_Care_Coordination_Process.4.pdf","pmid":"26241622","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"230","subjects":["nursing","healthservices"],"title":"The Population Care Coordination Process","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/population-care-coordination-process"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183187,"mean":6.9217013823156,"rank":6214388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1101753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183187,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228815,"mean":8.6513762269792,"rank":158279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":38424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228815,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":455,"mean":0.90814977973568,"rank":257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":455,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
