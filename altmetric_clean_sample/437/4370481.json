We find that the theory is reasonably stable to this extension; furthermore, it provides improved accuracy for molecules containing transition metals. We illustrate the extended on-top density functionals by applying them to Cr2, Cu2, Ag2, Os2, and Re2Cl8(2-) as well as to our previous database of 56 data for bond dissociation energies, barrier heights, reaction energies, proton affinities, and the water dimer. The performance of MC-PDFT is comparable to or better than that of CASPT2.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bcd","authors":["Rebecca K.
