Compared to CD45(+) leukocytes, the ECs expressed higher levels (p < 0.05) of EC surface markers used on FACS and other EC related genes. The gene expression profile showed that these isolated ECs fell into two clusters, A and B, that differentially expressed 19 genes related to angiogenesis, inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling, with cluster B ECs have demonstrating similarities to senescent or aging ECs.\nCombination of endovascular device sampling, FACS and single-cell quantitative RT-PCR is a feasible method for analyzing EC gene expression profile in vascular lesions.","altmetric_jid":"537f30852a83eeb45a8b458e","authors":["Sun, Zhengda","Lawson, Devon A","Sinclair, Elizabeth","Wang, Chih-Yang","Lai, Ming-Derg","Hetts, Steven W","Higashida, Randall T","Dowd, Christopher F","Halbach, Van V","Werb, Zena","Su, Hua","Cooke, Daniel L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.btre.2015.07.001","first_seen_on":"2015-08-07T15:00:20+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci","nhlbi"],"issns":["2215017X","2215-017X"],"journal":"Biotechnology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1438959578,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2215017X15000429"],"pmid":"26989654","pubdate":"2016-03-19T22:01:10+00:00","title":"Endovascular biopsy: Strategy for analyzing gene expression profiles of individual endothelial cells obtained from human vessels ","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endovascular-biopsy-strategy-analyzing-gene-expression-profiles-individual-endothelial-cells-obtaine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5452810,"mean":6.3482261447277,"rank":4537762,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5452810,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190445,"mean":8.8942423494571,"rank":152652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190445,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":1.1313953488372,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
