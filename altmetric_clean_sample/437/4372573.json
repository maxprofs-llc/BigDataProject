HRU data were extracted retrospectively from the patients' charts from 3.5\u00a0months before the index SRE until 3\u00a0months after the index SRE (defined as an SRE preceded by an SRE-free period of at least 6.5\u00a0months).\nOverall, the mean number of inpatient stays per SRE increased from baseline by approximately 0.5-1.5 stays, with increases in the total duration of inpatient stays of approximately 6-37\u00a0days per event. All SREs were associated with substantial increases from baseline in the frequency of procedures and the number of outpatient and day-care visits.\nSREs are associated with substantial HRU owing to considerable increases in the number and duration of inpatient stays, and in the number of procedures, outpatient visits, and day-care visits. These data collectively provide a valuable summary of the real-world SRE burden on European healthcare systems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000734e","authors":["Jean-Jacques Body","Jo\u00e3o Pereira","Harm Sleeboom","Nikos Maniadakis","Evangelos Terpos","Yves Pascal Acklin","Jindrich Finek","Oliver Gunther","Guy Hechmati","Tony Mossman","Luis Costa","Wojciech Rogowski","Hareth Nahi","Roger von Moos"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10198-015-0716-7","first_seen_on":"2015-08-07T12:40:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1618-7601"],"journal":"The European Journal of Health Economics","last_mentioned_on":1439373809,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10198-015-0716-7","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26253584?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10198-015-0716-7"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10198-015-0716-7.pdf","pmid":"26253584","pubdate":"2015-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Economic Policy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Care Management","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Economics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacoeconomics and Health Outcomes","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Finance & Economics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"subjects":["publichealth","healthservices"],"title":"Health resource utilization associated with skeletal-related events: results from a retrospective European study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/health-resource-utilization-associated-skeletalrelated-events-results-retrospective-european-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5476876,"mean":6.3619433143891,"rank":2107691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3324849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5476876,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192399,"mean":8.8437565463259,"rank":66950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":123554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192399,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":450,"mean":3.150004454343,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":450,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":4.7333333333333,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
