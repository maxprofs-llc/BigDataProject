We have previously identified 2-[5-(4-fluoro-phenylcarbamoyl)-pyridin-2-ylsulfanylmethyl]-phenylboronic acid (SX-517) and 6-(2-boronic acid-5-trifluoromethoxy-benzylsulfanyl)-N-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-nicotinamide (SX-576) as potent non-competitive boronic acid-containing CXCR1\/2 antagonists. Herein we report the synthesis and evaluation of aminopyridine and aminopyrimidine analogs of SX-517 and SX-576, identifying (2-{(benzyl)[(5-boronic acid-2-pyridyl)methyl]amino}-5-pyrimidinyl)(4-fluorophenylamino)formaldehyde as a potent chemokine antagonist with improved aqueous solubility and oral bioavailability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f2","authors":["Schuler, Aaron D","Engles, Courtney A","Maeda, Dean Y","Quinn, Mark T","Kirpotina, Liliya N","Wicomb, Winston N","Mason, S Nicholas","Auten, Richard L","Zebala, John A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmcl.2015.07.090","first_seen_on":"2015-08-08T13:58:59+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi","nigms"],"issns":["1464-3405","0960894X"],"issue":"18","journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters","last_mentioned_on":1464775929,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26248802?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26248802","pubdate":"2015-08-08T22:01:21+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Boronic acid-containing aminopyridine- and aminopyrimidinecarboxamide CXCR1\/2 antagonists: Optimization of aqueous solubility and oral bioavailability.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/boronic-acidcontaining-aminopyridine-aminopyrimidinecarboxamide-cxcr12-antagonists-optimization-aque"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7842728,"mean":6.6456077751988,"rank":6792741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7842728,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227592,"mean":8.4880090425369,"rank":189482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227592,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2005,"mean":2.6275079840319,"rank":1555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2005,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":1.6843,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
