Here, we report the investigation of molecular mechanism underlying red pigmentation in purple-leaf plum 'Ziyeli' (Prunus cerasifera Ehrhar f. atropurpurea (Jacq.) Rehd.), which shows red color pigmentation in fruit (flesh and skin) and foliage. Six anthocyanin-activating MYB genes, designated PcMYB10.1 to PcMYB10.6, were isolated based on RNA-Seq data from leaves of cv. Ziyeli. Of these PcMYB10 genes, five (PcMYB10.1 through PcMYB10.5) show distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns, while the PcMYB10.6 gene is highly expressed in all the purple-coloured organs of cv. Ziyeli. Constitutive activation of PcMYB10.6 is closely related to red pigmentation in the leaf, fruit (flesh and skin), and sepal. However, the PcMYB10.6 activation cannot induce red pigmentation in the petal of cv. Ziyeli during late stages of flower development due to due to a lack of expression of PcUFGT. The inhibition of red pigmentation in the petal of cherry plum could be attributed to the high-level expression of PcANR that directs anthocyanidin flux to proanthocyanidin biosynthesis. In addition, PcMYB10.2 is highly expressed in fruit and sepal, but its expression cannot induce red pigmentation. This suggests the PcMYB10 gene family in cherry plum may have diverged in function and PcMYB10.2 plays little role in the regulation of red pigmentation. Our study provides for the first time an example of constitutive activation of an anthocyanin-activating MYB gene in Prunus although its underlying mechanism remains unclear.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Gu, Chao","Liao, Liao","Zhou, Hui","Wang, Lu","Deng, Xianbao","Han, Yuepeng"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0135159","first_seen_on":"2015-08-08T10:16:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1439028967,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26247780?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26247780","pubdate":"2015-08-08T22:01:41+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Constitutive Activation of an Anthocyanin Regulatory Gene PcMYB10.6 Is Related to Red Coloration in Purple-Foliage Plum.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/constitutive-activation-anthocyanin-regulatory-gene-pcmyb106-related-red-coloration-purplefoliage-pl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5462004,"mean":6.3513590516133,"rank":3843649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":917915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5462004,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191630,"mean":8.8978390535881,"rank":132587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":37973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191630,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94931,"mean":9.6249274202044,"rank":68992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":15387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94931,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6143,"mean":8.4517929013351,"rank":4556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":954,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6143,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
