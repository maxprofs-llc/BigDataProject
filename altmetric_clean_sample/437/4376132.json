The ability of endometriosis to transform into malignancy, first described by Sampson in 1925, is a rare occurrence affecting 1% of lesions with ovary being the primary site in 79%. The authors describe 3 premenopausal women without risk factors for malignancy presenting with ovarian and\/or extraovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma. All of them demonstrated features of pre-\/coexisting endometriosis but malignancy was preoperatively suspected in only 1 instance. Postsurgical follow-up of the cases did not document any recurrence. The propensity for malignant conversion occurring in women 10 to 20 years younger vis-a-vis those affected by de novo ovarian cancer, destruction of the endometriotic foci, and underreporting vindicate close follow-up and scrutiny of women with endometriosis and ovarian endometriomas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002bab","authors":["Sunil Jaiman","Manjula Pochiraju","Sirisha Rao Gundabattula","Kameswari Surampudi","Dama Venkata Lakshmi Narayana Rao","Sreekanth Kandikattu"],"doi":"10.1177\/1066896915583995","endpage":"471","first_seen_on":"2015-08-08T17:47:54+00:00","issns":["1940-2465"],"issue":"6","journal":"International Journal of Surgical Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1439056060,"links":["http:\/\/ijs.sagepub.com\/content\/23\/6\/465.abstract?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ijs.sagepub.com\/content\/23\/6\/465.full.pdf","pmid":"25911569","pubdate":"2015-04-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"465","subjects":["pathology","generalsurgery"],"title":"Malignant Transformation of Pelvic Endometriosis Case Series and Review of the Literature","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/malignant-transformation-pelvic-endometriosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5461534,"mean":6.3512398365044,"rank":4543717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5461534,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191448,"mean":8.904359034093,"rank":153530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191448,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268,"mean":1.1913707865169,"rank":163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.5142857142857,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mvmd0908\/status\/630072903107674112","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4376132],"posted_on":"2015-08-08T17:47:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Pathology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3701221689\/4fecd7c62afe6ce7715060e9d6f876a1_normal.jpeg","description":"Dermatopathologist Tweets are not medical advice RT is not endorsement #dermpath #pathology #pathologists","id_on_source":"mvmd0908","tweeter_id":"1444165801","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5520},"tweet_id":"630072903107674112"}]}}
