TC average females rose 1% to 390 pm, USA rising 48% to 560 pm. TC average over 75's male and female increased 117% and 143%; USA rising 368% and 663%, significantly more than 16 countries. Cancer mortality - Average 55-74 male and female fell 20% and 12%, USA down 36% and 18%. TC average over 75's male and female fell 13% and 15%, the USA 29% and 2%. Circulatory deaths - TC average 55-74 rates fell 60% and 46% the USA down 54% and 53%. Over 75's average down 46% and 39%, USA falling 40% and 33%. ORs for rose substantially in every country. TC average 75's ORs for CMR: TND male and females were 1:2.83 and 1:3.04 but the USA 1:5.18 and 1:6.50. The ORs for CDD: TND male and females TC average was 1:3.42 and 1:3.62 but the USA 1:6.13 and 1:9.89.\nEvery country's neurological deaths rose relative to the controls, especially in the USA, which is a cause for concern and suggests possible environmental influences.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5373cf058f61000462c","authors":["Colin Pritchard","Emily Rosenorn-Lanng","Pritchard, Colin","Rosenorn-Lanng, Emily"],"doi":"10.4103\/2152-7806.161420","first_seen_on":"2015-08-07T21:45:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2152-7806","2229-5097"],"issue":"1","journal":"Surgical Neurology International","last_mentioned_on":1441359945,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4103\/2152-7806.161420","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4521226\/"],"pmid":"26290774","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"123","title":"Neurological deaths of American adults (55\u201374) and the over 75's by sex compared with 20 Western countries 1989\u20132010: Cause for concern","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.surgicalneurologyint.com\/text.asp?2015\/6\/1\/123\/161420","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neurological-deaths-american-adults-5574-75s-sex-compared-20-western-countries-19892010-cause-concer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":20.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":20.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6234009,"mean":5.8448882779721,"rank":270453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":5962889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6234009,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193381,"mean":8.8704406039921,"rank":14697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":178654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193381,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":365,"mean":5.1749615384615,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":365,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":4.2528571428571,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
