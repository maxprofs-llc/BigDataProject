Fifty-six subjects participated (four categories differing in body composition): ten older women (fat-free mass (FFM) 42.0 (sd 6.3) kg, aged 59 (sd 2) years, BMI 27.5 (sd 6.9) kg\/m(2)), fifteen younger women (FFM 45.5 (sd 5.2) kg, aged 34 (sd 10) years, BMI 21.9 (sd 2.3) kg\/m(2)), twelve older men (FFM 56.8 (sd 5.9) kg, aged 62 (sd 4) years, BMI 25.7 (sd 3.3) kg\/m(2)) and nineteen younger men (FFM 63.9 (sd 7.5) kg, aged 23.1 (sd 3.9) years, BMI 22.9 (sd 1.8) kg\/m(2)). Measurements consisted of habitual meal frequency by validated food-intake diaries, physical activity by tri-axial accelerometers and resting EE by a ventilated hood system. Habitual meal frequency was expressed as a function of resting EE (including resting EE as a function of FFM), and of activity-induced EE, using regression analysis. FFM differed according to gender and age categories (P<0.01). Physical activity level was higher in the younger men than in the other categories (P<0.05). No relationship of meal frequency with the variables assessed was observed in subjects with a low FFM (the women). In the subjects with a medium FFM (the older men), meal frequency was positively related to resting EE (r(2) 0.4, P<0.05), but not to the residuals of resting EE as a function of FFM, and inversely related to activity-induced EE (r(2) 0.3, P<0.05). Resting EE explained 40 % of the variation in meal frequency; adding activity-induced EE increased this to 60 %. In the subjects with a high FFM (the younger men), meal frequency was inversely related to resting EE (r(2) 0.8, P<0.0001) and to the residuals of resting EE as a function of FFM (P=0.03), and positively related to activity-induced EE (r(2) 0.6, P<0.0001). Resting EE explained 85 % of the variation in meal frequency; adding activity-induced EE increased this to 89 %. Habitual meal frequency was a function of components of EE, namely resting EE and activity-induced EE, only in subjects with a medium to high FFM (men). FFM-related differences in these relationships suggest a role of physical activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000579a","authors":["Westerterp-Plantenga, Margriet S","Goris, Annelies H C","Meijer, Erwin P","Westerterp, Klaas R"],"first_seen_on":"2015-08-08T14:07:53+00:00","issns":["0007-1145"],"issue":"3","journal":"British Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1439013614,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/13129471"],"pmid":"13129471","pubdate":"2003-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Habitual meal frequency in relation to resting and activity-induced energy expenditure in human subjects: the role of fat-free mass.","type":"article","volume":"90","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/habitual-meal-frequency-relation-resting-activityinduced-energy-expenditure-human-subjects-role-fatf"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5462004,"mean":6.3513590516133,"rank":4544222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5462004,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191635,"mean":8.8976984773058,"rank":153671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191635,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2678,"mean":10.293720582742,"rank":2379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2678,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":15.981339622642,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
