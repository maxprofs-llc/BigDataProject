This study investigated the potential use of phages as a therapy against hemorrhagic pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa in a murine hemorrhagic pneumonia model. An N4-like phage designated YH6 was isolated using P. aeruginosa strain D9. YH6 is a virulent phage with efficient and broad host lytic activity against P. aeruginosa. No bacterial virulence- or lysogenesis-related ORF is present in the YH6 genome, making it eligible for use in phage therapy. In our murine experiments, a single intranasal administration of YH6 (2\u00d710(7) PFU) 2 h after D9 intranasal injections at double minimum lethal dose was sufficient to protect mice against hemorrhagic pneumonia. The bacterial load in the lungs of YH6-protected mice was less than 10(3) CFU\/g within 24 h after challenge and ultimately became undetectable, whereas the amount of bacteria in the lung tissue derived from unprotected mice was more than 10(8) CFU\/g within 24 h after challenge. In view of its protective efficacy in this murine hemorrhagic pneumonia model, YH6 may serve as an alternative treatment strategy for infections caused by multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003468","authors":["Yang, Mei","Du, Chongtao","Gong, Pengjuan","Xia, Feifei","Sun, Changjiang","Feng, Xin","Lei, Liancheng","Song, Jun","Zhang, Lei","Wang, Bin","Xiao, Feng","Yan, Xinwu","Cui, Ziyin","Li, Xinwei","Gu, Jingmin","Han, Wenyu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.resmic.2015.07.008","first_seen_on":"2015-08-10T10:35:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1769-7123","09232508"],"journal":"Research in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1467886537,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26254772?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0923250815001242?sf13689347=1","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0923250815001242?sf13689348=1"],"pmid":"26254772","pubdate":"2015-08-10T22:00:16+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Therapeutic effect of the YH6 phage in a murine hemorrhagic pneumonia model ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/therapeutic-effect-yh6-phage-murine-hemorrhagic-pneumonia-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019263,"mean":6.7829620361534,"rank":1828747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6178197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019263,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228444,"mean":8.5929951629073,"rank":61183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":166594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228444,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":414,"mean":4.1606537530266,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":414,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":3.871875,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Unspecified":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1,"US":1,"NL":2,"GB":1},"mendeley":{"GR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/phagepapers\/statuses\/630688935656566785","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4379854],"posted_on":"2015-08-10T10:35:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Phagepapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/554637481182629889\/S0W4QvZw_normal.jpeg","description":"Tweet bot that delivers new phage related papers and news!
