Here we demonstrate a new type of room-temperature and high-energy density sodium rechargeable battery using an SO2-based inorganic molten complex catholyte, which showed a discharge capacity of 153\u2009mAh g(-1) based on the mass of catholyte and carbon electrode with an operating voltage of 3\u2009V, good rate capability and excellent cycle performance over 300 cycles. In particular, non-flammability and intrinsic self-regeneration mechanism of the inorganic liquid electrolyte presented here can accelerate the realization of commercialized Na rechargeable battery system with outstanding reliability. Given that high performance and unique properties of Na-SO2 rechargeable battery, it can be another promising candidate for next generation energy storage system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Goojin Jeong","Goojin Jeong","Hansu Kim","Hyo Sug Lee","Young-Kyu Han","Jong Hwan Park","Jae Hwan Jeon","Juhye Song","Keonjoon Lee","Taeeun Yim","Ki Jae Kim","Hyukjae Lee","Young-Jun Kim","Hun-Joon Sohn"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep12827","first_seen_on":"2015-08-06T23:14:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1444727100,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/srep12827","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/srep12827"],"pmid":"26243052","pubdate":"2015-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Electrochemistry","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Batteries","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"A room-temperature sodium rechargeable battery using an SO2-based nonflammable inorganic liquid catholyte","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/roomtemperature-sodium-rechargeable-battery-using-so2based-nonflammable-inorganic-liquid-catholyte"},"altmetric_score":{"score":19.46,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":19.46},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6237522,"mean":5.9780720020044,"rank":290394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":5947150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6237522,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183022,"mean":9.0756343042603,"rank":14785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":168237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183022,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21981,"mean":13.912410009099,"rank":2384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":19597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21981,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1668,"mean":12.5430029994,"rank":180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":1488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1668,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
