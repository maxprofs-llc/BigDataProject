Of 57 putatively functional human CYPs, only about a dozen enzymes are responsible for xenobiotic metabolism. CYP2 family is the predominant epoxygenase isoform abundantly expressed in the endothelium, myocardium, and kidney in humans. Numerous studies have demonstrated the cardiovascular protective effects of CYP epoxygenases and eicosatrienoic acids ranging from vasodilation, antihypertensive, proangiogenesis, antiatherosclerosis, and cardiac protection. The roles of CYP2 family and their metabolites in inflammation and cancer biology have recently attracted great attention. Here, we review the recent progress on polymorphisms, distribution and function of CYP2 family, and their roles in inflammation and cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f6100068c7","authors":["Chen, Chen","Wang, Dao Wen"],"doi":"10.1016\/bs.apha.2015.04.005","first_seen_on":"2015-08-08T02:02:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-8925"],"journal":"Advances in Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1457332030,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26233908?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/bs.apha.2015.04.005"],"pmid":"26233908","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Cytochrome P450-CYP2 Family-Epoxygenase Role in Inflammation and Cancer.","type":"article","volume":"74","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cytochrome-p450cyp2-familyepoxygenase-role-inflammation-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7361241,"mean":6.3959791151997,"rank":1504851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5807765,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7361241,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225021,"mean":8.3945883743669,"rank":56281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":168075,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225021,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":1.968813559322,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.59,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
