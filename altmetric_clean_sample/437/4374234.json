The purpose of this review is to highlight the breadth of findings from this in-depth testing approach, and to propose changes to our traditional testing and diagnostic paradigms. Lessons learned from modern molecular testing suggest that the previous concept of inherited retinal dystrophies as a group of 'single gene diseases' may require a significant update.\nAll of the known retinal dystrophies genes can now be sequenced. In many cases, this nonhypothesis driven testing strategy is uncovering mutations in unsuspected genes, generating data that challenges established concepts of genetic mechanisms and provides insights regarding genes previously thought to be exclusively related to syndromic disease. Recent advances in testing have improved not only the breadth, but also the depth of genetic data. For example, deep intronic sequencing has uncovered many novel intronic mutations\/variations in the ABCA4 gene.\nCurrently, in approximately 50-60% of patients with nonsyndromic retinal dystrophy, the disease mechanism can be identified. The presence of pathogenic alleles in more than one gene is not uncommon. Retinal dystrophy, with relatively defined clinical presentations and a large but limited number of genes involved, is becoming a model for the next-generation study of molecular disease mechanisms.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License, where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
