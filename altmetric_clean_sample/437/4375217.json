Here, we identify the A. thaliana glycolate oxidase (GOX) paralogs GOX1, GOX2 and GOX3 as putative L-lactate metabolizing enzymes based on their homology to CYB2, the L-lactate cytochrome c oxidoreductase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that GOX3 uses L-lactate with a similar efficiency as glycolate; in contrast the photorespiratory isoforms, GOX1 and GOX2, which share similar enzymatic properties, use glycolate with much higher efficiencies than L-lactate. The key factor making GOX3 more efficient with L-lactate than GOX1 and GOX2 is a 5- to 10-fold lower Km for the substrate. Consequently, only GOX3 can efficiently metabolize L-lactate at low intracellular concentrations. Isotope tracer experiments as well as substrate toxicity tests using GOX3 loss-of-function and overexpressor plants indicate that L-lactate is metabolized in vivo by GOX3. Moreover, GOX3 rescues the lethal growth phenotype of a yeast strain lacking CYB2, which cannot grow on L-lactate as sole carbon source. GOX3 is predominantly present in roots and mature to aging leaves but is largely absent from young photosynthetic leaves, indicting that it plays a role predominantly in heterotrophic rather than autotrophic tissues, at least under standard growth conditions. In roots of plants grown under normoxic conditions, loss-of-function of GOX3 induces metabolic rearrangements that mirror wild-type responses under hypoxia. Thus, we identified GOX3 as the enzyme that metabolizes L-lactate to pyruvate in vivo and hypothesize that it may ensure the sustainment of low levels of L-lactate after its formation under normoxia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333b","authors":["Engqvist, Martin Km","Schmitz, Jessica","Gertzmann, Anke","Florian, Alexandra","Jaspert, Nils","Arif, Muhammad Arif","Balazadeh, Salma","Mueller-Roeber, Bernd","Fernie, Alisdair R","Maurino, Veronica G"],"doi":"10.1104\/pp.15.01003","first_seen_on":"2015-08-08T10:38:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-2548","00320889"],"journal":"Plant Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1468063100,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26246447?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/publications.lib.chalmers.se\/publication\/225811-glycolate-oxidase3-a-glycolate-oxidase-homolog-of-yeast-l-lactate-cytochrome-c-oxidoreductase-suppor"],"pmid":"26246447","pubdate":"2015-08-08T22:02:01+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"GLYCOLATE OXIDASE3, a Glycolate Oxidase Homolog of Yeast l-Lactate Cytochrome c Oxidoreductase, Supports l-Lactate Oxidation in Roots of Arabidopsis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glycolate-oxidase3-glycolate-oxidase-homolog-yeast-llactate-cytochrome-c-oxidoreductase-supports-lla"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8037685,"mean":6.8229478924494,"rank":4240532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2234835,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8037685,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229051,"mean":8.5874999519757,"rank":121292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":84947,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229051,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3809,"mean":4.0053702731092,"rank":2347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3809,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":3.7692295081967,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
