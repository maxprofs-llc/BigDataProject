Tax, which is the most important regulatory protein of HTLV-1, is associated with aggressive proliferation of host cells and is also a major target antigen for CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs). Recently, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has proven effective for ATL, and donor-derived Tax-specific CTL might contribute to graft-versus-ATL effects in some recipients who maintained complete remission after allo-HSCT. We, for the first time, analyzed the Tax-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, phenotypes and functions of Tax-specific CTLs at single-cell levels in HLA-A24(+) ATL patients who underwent allo-HSCT. We found that 1) a particular amino acid sequence motif (PDR) in the CDR3 region of TCR-\u03b2 was conserved in different patients and also within the same patient before and after allo-HSCT, and 2) the PDR(+) Tax-specific CTL clone selectively expanded in ATL long-term survivors as less-differentiated effector memory CTLs. Actually, the PDR(+) CTL showed not only strong binding activity for the Tax-tetramer but also strong killing activity against patients' HTLV-1-infected T-cells without any reaction against normal cells. We are presently evaluating the killing activities of PDR(+)TCR-transduced T-cells against Tax in immunodeficient mice, with the aim of developing a new immunotherapy for ATL.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd1e","authors":["Tanaka, Yukie","Kanda, Yoshinobu"],"doi":"10.11406\/rinketsu.56.815","first_seen_on":"2015-08-08T10:36:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0485-1439"],"issue":"7","journal":"[Rinsh\u014d ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology","last_mentioned_on":1439030181,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26251144?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pmid":"26251144","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Development of Tax-redirected T-cell immunotherapy using TCR gene transduction in patients with ATL.","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-taxredirected-tcell-immunotherapy-using-tcr-gene-transduction-patients-atl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5462231,"mean":6.3515210593466,"rank":3843776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":918068,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5462231,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191665,"mean":8.8973860714585,"rank":132604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":37971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191665,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133,"mean":1.0595303030303,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
