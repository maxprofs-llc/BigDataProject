The monitoring of metal concentrations in fish meat is therefore important to ensure compliance with food safety regulations and consequent consumer protection. The toxicity of these metals may be dependent on their chemical forms, which requires metal speciation processes for direct measurement of toxic metal species or the identification of prediction models in order to determine toxic metal forms from measured total metal concentrations. This review addresses various shortcomings in current knowledge and research on the accumulation of metal contaminants in commercially consumed marine fish globally and particularly in South Africa, affecting both the fishing industry as well as fish consumers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007ee9","authors":["Bosch, Adina C.","O'Neill, Bernadette","Sigge, Gunnar O.","Kerwath, Sven E.","Hoffman, Louwrens C.","Bosch, Adina C","Sigge, Gunnar O","Kerwath, Sven E","Hoffman, Louwrens C"],"doi":"10.1002\/jsfa.7360","endpage":"48","first_seen_on":"2015-08-08T13:21:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1097-0010"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture","last_mentioned_on":1439224534,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jsfa.7360\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jsfa.7360\/pdf","pmid":"26238481","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Nursing","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"32","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Heavy metals in marine fish meat and consumer health: a review","type":"article","volume":"96","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/heavy-metals-marine-fish-meat-consumer-health-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454259,"mean":7.1049607816478,"rank":3640325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4776631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454259,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230989,"mean":8.6948140596049,"rank":86075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":143300,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230989,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1479,"mean":3.191901217862,"rank":569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1479,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.6453076923077,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
