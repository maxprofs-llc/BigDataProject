Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells with the t(1:19) translocation express the WNT16 gene, which is thought to contribute to transformation.\nER-stress blocks processing of endogenous WNT16 protein in RCH-ACV and 697 ALL cells. Biochemical analysis showed an aggregation of WNT16 proteins in the ER of stressed cells. These large protein masses cannot be completely cleared by ER-associated protein degradation, and require for additional autophagic responses. Pharmacological block of autophagy significantly increased cell death in ER-stressed ALL. Furthermore, murine cells engineered to express WNT16 are similarly sensitized.\nALL cells expressing WNT16 are sensitive to ER stress, and show enhanced killing after addition of chloroquine. These findings suggest a potential clinical application of inducers of ER stress with inhibitors of autophagy in patients with high-risk ALL.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a66","authors":["Verras, Meletios","Papandreou, Ioanna","Denko, Nicholas C"],"first_seen_on":"2015-08-09T10:12:28+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1791-7530"],"issue":"9","journal":"Anticancer Research: International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1439115518,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26254351?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26254351","pubdate":"2015-08-09T22:00:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"WNT16-expressing Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Cells are Sensitive to Autophagy Inhibitors after ER Stress Induction.","type":"article","volume":"35"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5461682,"mean":6.3512561583122,"rank":3615575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1618175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5461682,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190644,"mean":8.9324292840545,"rank":122799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":58666,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190644,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1532,"mean":2.9836368386675,"rank":799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1532,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":1.6177674418605,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AutophagyPapers\/status\/630320692068626432","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4377663],"posted_on":"2015-08-09T10:12:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Autophagy Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/559405603697590273\/EoGNUIXe_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for #Autophagy papers.
