They display MIC values comprised between 25 and 12.5\u03bcM (close to ethambutol EMB) for the mono- and the hexa-substituted derivatives, and 0.8\u03bcM (close to isoniazid and streptomycin) for the tri-substituted derivative. The three bi- and the tetra-substituted analogs displayed MIC values of ca. 6.5-3.0\u03bcM. The latter were also evaluated against the isoniazid-resistant MYC5165 strain, resulting in highly interesting micromolar or sub-micromolar MIC, ca. 4-125 times more active than isoniazid. These preliminary results are attractive for the development of new anti-TB agents.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f1","authors":["Massimba-Dibama, Hugues","Mourer, Maxime","Constant, Patricia","Daff\u00e9, Mamadou","Regnouf-de-Vains, Jean-Bernard"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmc.2015.07.053","first_seen_on":"2015-08-10T10:02:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1464-3391"],"journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1439200956,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26254828?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26254828","pubdate":"2015-08-10T22:00:13+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Guanidinium compounds with sub-micromolar activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
