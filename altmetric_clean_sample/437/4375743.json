We report a rare case of a low-grade oligodendroglioma that arose in the pineal region. Clinical Presentation\u2003A young woman complaining of a headache underwent magnetic resonance imaging that showed a mass in the pineal region and mild hydrocephalus. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was performed followed by a near-total tumor removal, due to tumor invasion of the tectal plate and thalamus. The histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of a low-grade oligodendroglioma. The patient then underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy as adjuvant therapies. Conclusion\u2003Although the pineal region is a common place for a large number of tumoral lesions, low-grade oligodendrogliomas are extremely rare in this location. This case is only the second account of a benign oligodendroglioma of the pineal region reported in the literature.","altmetric_jid":"565496cd2a83ee7c2d8b4572","authors":["Lamis, Fabricio Correa","de Paiva Neto, Manoel Antonio","Stavale, Jo\u00e3o Norberto","Cavalheiro, Sergio"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0034-1396653","first_seen_on":"2015-08-08T13:52:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2193-6358"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Neurological Surgery REPORTS","last_mentioned_on":1439041925,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26251811?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26251811","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Low-Grade Oligodendroglioma of the Pineal Region: Case Report.","type":"article","volume":"76","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lowgrade-oligodendroglioma-pineal-region-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5462004,"mean":6.3513590516133,"rank":2902351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1857002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5462004,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191634,"mean":8.8977409945052,"rank":104489,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":68432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191634,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":2.133625,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":3.3785454545455,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TC_papers\/status\/630013613672042496","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4375743],"posted_on":"2015-08-08T13:52:05+00:00","author":{"name":"TC_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507539334375829504\/IcPjrJI3_normal.jpeg","description":"Pubmed twitterbot: arealization OR patterning OR somatosensory OR thalamus OR thalamocortical OR cortical development","id_on_source":"TC_papers","tweeter_id":"2789910212","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":180},"tweet_id":"630013613672042496"}]}}
