Materials and Methods This single-center retrospective study and meta-analysis was approved by the institutional review board. At a single institution from 2000 to 2013, 252 consecutive patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage at computed tomography (CT) and two DSA examinations negative for aneurysm within 10 days were evaluated for inclusion in the study, and 131 met CT criteria for PM nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (53 women; mean age, 53 years [range, 33-88 years]). DS angiographic reports were reviewed for causative abnormalities. Three reviewers searched MEDLINE and electronic databases for studies that reported detection of aneurysm in subjects with PM hemorrhage who had undergone multiple DSA examinations. Main inclusion criteria were PM hemorrhage at CT per van Gijn classification, head CT performed within 72 hours of symptom onset, initial DS angiographic results negative for aneurysm, and two DSA examinations within 10 days. Studies with fewer than 25 subjects were excluded. Methodology was assessed by using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The summary rate of aneurysm detection for subsequent DSA was calculated by using a fixed-effects model. Results Six studies with 298 subjects and a single-institution study with 131 subjects were included. No aneurysms were seen at follow-up DSA in the single-center study (0.0%). Three aneurysms were detected at follow-up DSA in three of six studies from the literature (one of 29 [3.4%], one of 65 [1.5%], and one of 34 [2.9%] patients). Two occurred in cases that likely preceded the use of the current DSA technique. The summary aneurysm detection rate at subsequent DSA was 1.6% (95% confidence interval: 0.7%, 3.8%; range of individual study detection rate: 0.0%-3.4%). Conclusion In patients with PM nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and initial DSA negative for aneurysms, the yield of follow-up DSA for detection of causative aneurysms is very low.
