The Jefferson Scale of Empathy Student Version (JSE-S) was administered at the beginning and end of an academic year in which humanities courses were offered. Changes in JSE-S scores among students who studied Medical Humanities were compared to changes in student who did not take any humanities coursework.\nMedical humanities coursework correlated with superior empathy outcomes among the medical students. Of students not enrolled in humanities courses, 71% declined or failed to increase in JSE-S score over the academic year. Of those who took humanities coursework 46% declined or failed to increase in JSE-S scores.. The difference was statistically significant (p=.03). The medical humanities curriculum correlated with favorable empathy outcomes as measured by JSE-S.\nElective medical humanities coursework correlated with improved empathy score outcomes in a group of U.S. medical students. This may reflect a direct effect of the humanities coursework. Alternately, students' elective choice to take medical humanities coursework may be a marker for students with a propensity to favorable empathy outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002203","authors":["Jeremy Graham","Lauren M.
