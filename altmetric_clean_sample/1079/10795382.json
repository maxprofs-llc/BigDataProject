This change in epidemiology is mainly due to recent migratory flows. Moreover it emphasized the needfor cultural action (aimed at Urologists, Dermatologists, General Practitioners and Emergency Medicine doctors) to provide the elements for a correct and timely diagnosis. But the most important issue raised by this paper is the call for a fast track supply of drugs (usually not available in Italy) to field operators for treating tropical diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000ce51","authors":["Cenderello, Giovanni","Di Biagio, Antonio","Riccardi, Niccol\u00f2","Taramasso, Lucia","De Maria, Andrea","Cassola, Giovanni","Viscoli, Claudio"],"first_seen_on":"2016-08-24T12:22:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1121-7138"],"issue":"3","journal":"new microbiologica","last_mentioned_on":1472554347,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27551726?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27551726"],"pmid":"27551726","pubdate":"2016-08-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Increasing use and accessibility of anti parasitic drugs for migrants with neglected diseases at a time of migratory emergency.","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increasing-accessibility-anti-parasitic-drugs-migrants-neglected-diseases-time-migratory-emergency"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":3547063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4741633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253940,"mean":12.400652534663,"rank":101688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":151755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253940,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":1.5982919708029,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.798,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":4},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/par_papers\/statuses\/768422668555071489","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10795382],"posted_on":"2016-08-24T12:20:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Parasitology papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/528615611803238400\/tFsCRNLw_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Parasitology papers in PubMed, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
