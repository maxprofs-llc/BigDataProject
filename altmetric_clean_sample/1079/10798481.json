Herein, a nitric oxide (NO) gas-enhanced chemosensitization strategy is proposed to overcome MDR by construction of a biodegradable nanomedicine formula based on BNN6\/DOX coloaded monomethoxy(polyethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (mPEG-PLGA). On one hand, the nanomedicine features high biocompatibility due to the high density of PEG and biodegradable PLGA. On the other hand, the nanoformula exhibits excellent stability under physiological conditions but exhibits stimuli-responsive decomposition of BNN6 for NO gas release upon ultraviolet-visible irradiation. More importantly, after NO release is triggered, gas molecules are generated that break the nanoparticle shell and lead to the release of doxorubicin. Furthermore, NO was demonstrated to reverse the MDR of tumor cells and enhance the chemosensitization for doxorubicin therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Jing Fan"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsami.6b03737","endpage":"13811","first_seen_on":"2016-08-24T15:36:25+00:00","issns":["1944-8252","1944-8244"],"issue":"22","journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1472133617,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1021\/acsami.6b03737"],"pmid":"27213922","pubdate":"2016-06-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
