PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"REACH evaluated ramucirumab in the second-line treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. In the intent-to-treat population (n\u00a0=\u00a0565), a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) was not observed. In patients with an elevated baseline \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) level (400\u00a0ng\/mL or greater), an improvement in OS was demonstrated. An analysis of the Japanese patients in REACH was performed.\nAn analysis was performed with the subset of the intent-to-treat population enrolled in Japan (n\u00a0=\u00a093).\nThe median OS was 12.9\u00a0months for the ramucirumab arm (n\u00a0=\u00a045) and 8.0\u00a0months for the placebo arm (n\u00a0=\u00a048) [hazard ratio (HR) 0.621 (95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI) 0.391-0.986); P\u00a0=\u00a00.0416]. The median progression-free survival was 4.1\u00a0months for the ramucirumab arm and 1.7\u00a0months for the placebo arm [HR 0.449 (95\u00a0% CI 0.285-0.706); P\u00a0=\u00a00.0004]. The objective response rates were 11\u00a0% for the ramucirumab arm and 2\u00a0% for the placebo arm (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0817). The grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in more than 5\u00a0% of patients with a higher incidence for the ramucirumab arm (n\u00a0=\u00a044) than for the placebo arm (n\u00a0=\u00a047) were ascites (7% vs 2\u00a0%), hypertension (7\u00a0% vs 2\u00a0%), and cholangitis (7\u00a0% vs 0\u00a0%). In patients with a baseline AFP level of 400\u00a0ng\/mL or greater, the median OS was 12.9\u00a0months for the ramucirumab arm (n\u00a0=\u00a020) and 4.3\u00a0months for the placebo arm (n\u00a0=\u00a022) [HR 0.464 (95\u00a0% CI 0.232-0.926); P\u00a0=\u00a00.0263].\nIn the Japanese patients in REACH, ramucirumab treatment improved OS, including in patients with a baseline AFP level of 400\u00a0ng\/mL or greater; improvements in progression-free survival and objective response rate were also demonstrated. The safety profile of ramucirumab was acceptable and well tolerated in Japanese patients.
