A great deal of effort has been invested in measuring sexual motivation using different behavioral models mainly because human behavior is more complex than any model can reproduce.\nTo compare different animal models of male and female behaviors that measure sexual motivation as a key element in sexual medicine and focus on models that use a combination of molecular techniques and behavioral measurements.\nWe review the literature to describe models that evaluate different aspects of sexual motivation.\nNo single test is sufficient to evaluate sexual motivation. The best approach is to evaluate animals in different behavioral tests to measure the motivational state of the subject.\nDifferent motivated behaviors such as aggression, singing in the case of birds, and sexual behavior, which are crucial for reproduction, are associated with changes in mRNA levels of different receptors in brain areas that are important in the control of reproduction.\nResearch in animal models is crucial to understand the complexity of sexual behavior and all the mechanisms that influence such an important aspect of human well-being to decrease the physiologic and psychological impact of sexual dysfunctions. In other cases, research in different models is necessary to understand and recognize, not cure, the variability of sexuality, such as asexuality, which is another form of sexual orientation.","altmetric_jid":"53222dc92a83ee27268b459f","authors":["Ventura-Aquino, Elisa","Paredes, Ra\u00fal G"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.sxmr.2016.07.003","first_seen_on":"2016-08-24T07:11:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["20500521","2050-0521"],"journal":"Sexual Medicine Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1478282400,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2050052116300294?np=y","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2050052116300294"],"pmid":"27566910","pubdate":"2016-08-28T22:01:25+00:00","title":"Animal Models in Sexual Medicine: The Need and Importance of Studying Sexual Motivation ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/animal-models-sexual-medicine-need-importance-studying-sexual-motivation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":3.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7644999,"mean":6.5733031223765,"rank":1696803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5936100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7644999,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246984,"mean":12.179194786685,"rank":74132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":172108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246984,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":6.1029795918367,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":3.1166666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1,"FI":1,"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DegenRolf\/statuses\/768344979555090432","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10790662],"posted_on":"2016-08-24T07:11:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Rolf Degen","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/u\/0\/101046916407340625977\/posts","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000073429129\/906bb91c9498fc18b2a1eca11d78c6e6_normal.jpeg","description":"Science writer and book author in psychology, neuroscience and evolution","id_on_source":"DegenRolf","tweeter_id":"1560875191","geo":{"lt":50.73438,"ln":7.09548,"country":"DE"},"followers":8905},"tweet_id":"768344979555090432"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/slutreplik\/statuses\/768348910209343488","license":"gnip","rt":["DegenRolf"],"citation_ids":[10790662],"posted_on":"2016-08-24T07:27:10+00:00","author":{"name":"TT","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/889794254456987650\/yRNJZgoS_normal.jpg","description":"Cognocenti -
