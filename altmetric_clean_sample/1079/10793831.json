The study and comprehension of callosal dysgenesis can provide remarkable insights into embryonic or fetal commissural development. The diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique allows the in\u00a0vivo analyses of the white-matter microstructure and is a valid tool to clarify the disturbances of brain connections in patients with dysgenesis of the corpus callosum (CC). The segmental callosal agenesis (SCAG) is a rare partial agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). In a newborn with SCAG the DTI and tractography analyses proved that the CC was made of two separate segments consisting respectively of the ventral part in the genu and body of the CC, connecting the frontal lobes, and the dorsal part in the CC splenium and the attached hippocampal commissure (HC), connecting the parietal lobes and the fornix. These findings support the embryological thesis of a separated origin of the ventral and the dorsal parts of the CC.","authors":["Scola, Elisa","Sirgiovanni, Ida","Avignone, Sabrina","Cinnante, Claudia Maria","Biffi, Riccardo","Fumagalli, Monica","Triulzi, Fabio"],"doi":"10.1177\/1971400916665390","first_seen_on":"2016-08-24T10:46:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2385-1996"],"journal":"The neuroradiology journal","last_mentioned_on":1472035565,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27549148?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27549148","pubdate":"2016-08-24T22:07:12+00:00","title":"Fetal development of the corpus callosum: Insights from a 3T DTI and tractography study in a patient with segmental callosal agenesis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fetal-development-corpus-callosum-insights-3t-dti-tractography-study-patient-segmental-callosal-agen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BrainDev_Papers\/statuses\/768398972096512000","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10793831],"posted_on":"2016-08-24T10:46:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Brain Devpt Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509753490235588608\/j_1bd6bb_normal.png","description":"twitterbot for #CorticalThickness #SurfaceArea #DTI #Neuroimaging  #cognition papers related to #humanBrainDevelopment (curated from #PubMed) by @shaili3","id_on_source":"BrainDev_Papers","tweeter_id":"2801984094","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":57},"tweet_id":"768398972096512000"}]}}
