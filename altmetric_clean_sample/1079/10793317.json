The modeled molecular structures contain a large number of photoreactive mesogens with linear orientation. Flexible side chains are interconnected through covalent bonds under periodic boundary conditions. A switchable dihedral potential was applied on a diazene moiety to describe the photochemical trans-to-cis isomerization. To quantify the photo-induced molecular reorientation and its effect on the macroscopic actuation of the neat PRP and PRP\/Au materials, we characterized the photo-strain and other material properties including elastic stiffness and thermal stability according to the photo-isomerization ratio of the reactive groups. We particularly examined the effect of nanoparticle size on the photo-thermal actuation by varying the diameter of the nanofiller (10 to 20 \u00c5) under the same volume fraction of 1.62%. The results indicated that the insertion of the gold nanoparticles enlarges the photo-strain of the material while enhancing its mechanical stiffness and thermal stability. When the diameter of the nanoparticle reaches a size similar to or smaller than the length of the mesogen, the interfacial energy between the nanofiller and the surrounding polymer matrix does not significantly affect the alignment of the mesogens, but rather the adsorption energy at the interface generates a stable interphase layer. Hence, these improvements were more effective as the size of the gold nanoparticle decreased. The present findings suggest a wider analysis of the nanofiller-reinforced PRP composites and could be a guide for the mechanical design of the PRP actuator system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Choi, Joonmyung","Chung, Hayoung","Yun, Jung-Hoon","Cho, Maenghyo"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsami.6b04818","first_seen_on":"2016-08-24T10:18:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1944-8252"],"journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1472033861,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27552297?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27552297","pubdate":"2016-08-24T22:01:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
