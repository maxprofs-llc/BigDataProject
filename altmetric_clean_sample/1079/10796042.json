We aimed to investigate sarcopenia in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent complete resection, and the relationship of sarcopenia with clinicopathological factors.\nAll consecutive patients who underwent lung resection between January 2005 and December 2008 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Eligible patients were assigned to one of 2 groups according to the presence or absence of sarcopenia, as assessed by the sum of cross-sectional areas of skeletal muscles in the region of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) on preoperative computed tomography (CT).\nSixteen of 52 male (30.8%) and 22 of 38 female (57.9%) patients were identified with sarcopenia (p=0.01). Patients with sarcopenia were more likely to have a low body mass index (BMI) (p<0.0001). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with sarcopenia had a significantly worse outcome than patients without sarcopenia (5-year-survival: 72.8% vs 85.8%, respectively, p=0.028). Multivariate analysis found that sarcopenia was a significant independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio: 7.09, p=0.0008).\nSarcopenia identified on a cross-sectional CT image of the L3 level was associated with poor outcome with completely resected early-stage NSCLC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fe3cf058f610003039","authors":["Yuzo Suzuki","Tatsuro Okamoto","Takatoshi Fujishita","Masakazu Katsura","Takaki Akamine","Shinkichi Takamori","Yosuke Morodomi","Tetsuzo Tagawa","Fumihiro Shoji","Yoshihiko Maehara"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.lungcan.2016.08.007","first_seen_on":"2016-08-24T13:00:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-8332","01695002"],"journal":"Lung Cancer (01695002)","last_mentioned_on":1472049227,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.lungcancerjournal.info\/retrieve\/pii\/S0169500216304482?sf33786656%253D1%2526cc%253Dy&rc=0&code=lung-site","http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0169500216304482?via=sd&cc=y&sf33786663=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.lungcancerjournal.info\/article\/S0169500216304482\/pdf","pmid":"27794415","pubdate":"2016-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Clinical implications of sarcopenia in patients undergoing complete resection for early non-small cell lung cancer","type":"article","volume":"101","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-implications-sarcopenia-patients-undergoing-complete-resection-early-nonsmall-cell-lung-can-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":4399221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2302968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253542,"mean":12.399376779298,"rank":139723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":88349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253542,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":864,"mean":8.1571286210892,"rank":476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":864,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":16.3728125,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NL":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OncologyAdvance\/statuses\/768432716064980992","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10796042],"posted_on":"2016-08-24T13:00:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Oncology Advance","url":"http:\/\/oncologyadvance.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/888294722263027712\/4fgo7f8y_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"OncologyAdvance","tweeter_id":"41114958","geo":{"lt":52.37403,"ln":4.88969,"country":"NL"},"followers":15525},"tweet_id":"768432716064980992"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CRWLibrary\/statuses\/768456275055222784","license":"gnip","rt":["OncologyAdvance"],"citation_ids":[10796042],"posted_on":"2016-08-24T14:33:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Library VCC","url":"http:\/\/www.wales.nhs.uk\/velindrelibrary","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/478464349476884480\/YlBsicot_normal.jpeg","description":"The only cancer specialist library service in Wales.
