There is a myriad of HS wound care management strategies implemented by clinicians and patients that is centered around which dressings to use. Many factors affect which HS wound care dressing is the most appropriate to use such as the type of HS wound, cost, ease of application, patient comfort, absorbency, and odor management among many others. In this work, the authors prepare a set of guidelines for optimal HS wound care dressing use based on a tier system, ideal characteristics of HS dressings, and the type of HS lesion. The dressing recommendations focus on cost-effectiveness for patients, ease of accessibility, and ultimately, improvement in the quality of life of patients suffering from HS. Silver-impregnated foam is considered the most optimal HS wound care dressing because it contains nearly all characteristics of an ideal wound care dressing. However, it is expensive and difficult to access for patients, so other HS wound care dressings must be considered prior to utilizing silver-impregnated foam.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fbc","authors":["Abrahem Kazemi","Kelly Carnaggio","Maureen Clark","Cynthia Shephard","Ginette A.
