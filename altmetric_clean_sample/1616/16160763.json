One year later, however, she developed symptoms of mumps and within two days was completely deaf in the right ear. Prompt surgical exploration excluded a complication of the otosclerosis and a perilymph fistula, but culture of a sample of perilymph grew mumps virus. The case provides direct evidence of a relation between mumps virus infection and inner-ear damage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000245c","authors":["G A Westmore","B H Pickard","H Stern"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmj.1.6155.14","first_seen_on":"2017-02-06T06:06:35+00:00","issns":["0959-8138","1468-5833"],"issue":"6155","journal":"British Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1356998400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/bmj.1.6155.14"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/bmj\/1\/6155\/14.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1597537","pmid":"760934","pubdate":"1979-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Isolation of mumps virus from the inner ear after sudden deafness.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.bmj.com\/cgi\/doi\/10.1136\/bmj.1.6155.14","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isolation-mumps-virus-inner-ear-after-sudden-deafness"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8098128,"mean":6.8916355638706,"rank":1319267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6708315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8098128,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259538,"mean":12.904414260779,"rank":64293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":194963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259538,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34043,"mean":23.016546618883,"rank":15069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":18404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34043,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":838,"mean":48.509474313023,"rank":486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":838,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Prevention of measles, rubella, congenital rubella syndrome, and mumps, 2013; summary recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)","url":"https:\/\/stacks.cdc.gov\/view\/cdc\/13713\/cdc_13713_DS1.pdf","license":"public","citation_ids":[16160636,14594119,16152499,3028253,16160640,15684134,16160643,2978910,16160644,15366353,3183562,16160646,1418729,1418727,16153430,15638847,15638846,1930323,16160647,16160649,16160650,16682488,677333,190318,909050,173620,15819245,3383091,4539522,16160651,3658517,4624897,3239898,16160652,3703960,1009611,16160654,4221891,4235699,2250032,16152870,16152878,16160658,16160660,3672493,16160663,1461447,16160664,14167205,16160666,15518543,16160667,965246,16149743,16149744,16152857,16152855,4476346,16160672,16160673,4630403,981306,16160675,16160676,16160677,16160678,233832,15638834,2990800,15365082,560740,16160680,16160681,560745,5943878,15365092,7836183,2990802,6231311,2990798,247656,632818,16160690,16160692,443869,4602904,598747,16160695,16160697,590439,16160702,16160704,16803749,16160706,16160708,16160709,16160711,16160713,16160716,3369256,16160718,16160720,16160721,16160723,16160726,16160728,16160731,16160732,16160733,16160735,16160737,3334077,16160738,6721213,15358023,16160739,16160740,16160741,15722930,16160742,15834939,3116095,3116057,2996647,2916894,15651154,16160744,16160745,2362401,16160746,3713667,16160747,18157643,9562331,4917572,16160748,15375599,16160750,16160751,16160752,16160754,16160758,16160761,16160763,16160766,16160768,16160770,16160772,2289403,408594,13865533,16160774,16682495,16160775,16160776,16160778,16160780,16160782,15359310,1414267,15359312,16160787,3644915,16160791,16160792,15655896,16160794,1592950,16152868,16160795,16160796,3849948,14512685,19189419,16160802,5851376,16160803,13378152,1101833,1471549,16712815,1471543,16160806,16160809,16160810,556002,3266824,16160813,16160814,16160817,1147179,1177658,16160820,2153735,1033979],"posted_on":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","source":{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","description":"CDC is America\u2019s leading public health agency, dedicated to saving and protecting the health of Americans.
