However, how photorespiration affects plant basal defense still remains largely unknown. Here, we studied the involvement of photorespiration in tomato-Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 interaction focusing on three photorespiratory genes. Inoculation with P. syringae increased photorespiration rate (Pr) and expression of GLYCOLATE OXIDASE (GOX2), SERINE GLYOXYLATE AMINOTRANSFERASE (SGT) and SERINE HYDROXYL METHYLTRANSFERASE (SHMT1), however, inhibition of photorespiration by isonicotinic acid hydrazide decreased tomato basal defense against P. syringae. Furthermore, silencing of GOX2, SGT or SHMT1 genes in tomato decreased Pr but increased susceptibility to P. syringae, whereas transient overexpression of GOX2, SGT or SHMT1 in tobacco increased basal defense. Further study revealed that salicylic acid (SA) signaling is involved in GOX2-, SGT- and SHMT1-mediated defense. Moreover, H2 O2 pretreatment remarkably alleviated the GOX2 silencing-induced depression in basal defense and SA signaling, whereas had no effect on that of SGT- and SHMT1-silenced plants. Taken together, these results suggest that H2 O2 is critical for GOX2- but not SGT- or SHMT1-modulated SA signaling and subsequent basal defense against P. syringae. This work deepens the understanding of photorespiration-involved defense responses to bacterial attack in plants.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003340","authors":["Ahammed, Golam Jalal","Li, Xin","Zhang, Guanqun","Zhang, Huan","Shi, Junying","Pan, Caizhe","Yu, Jingquan","Shi, Kai"],"doi":"10.1111\/pce.12932","first_seen_on":"2017-02-06T10:01:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1365-3040"],"journal":"Plant, Cell & Environment","last_mentioned_on":1486375278,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pce.12932\/abstract;jsessionid=13752A571F32F3EA6F152040912728B7.f01t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pce.12932\/pdf","pmid":"28164315","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","botany"],"title":"Tomato photorespiratory glycolate oxidase\u2010derived H2O2 production contributes to basal defense against Pseudomonas syringae","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tomato-photorespiratory-glycolate-oxidasederived-h-sub2sub-o-sub2sub-production-contributes-basal-de"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170298,"mean":6.9145785001388,"rank":7070691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170298,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263012,"mean":12.85898980651,"rank":218288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263012,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1198,"mean":2.8042472848789,"rank":1085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1198,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":2.8707843137255,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/828544084587511809","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16167646],"posted_on":"2017-02-06T10:01:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":964},"tweet_id":"828544084587511809"}]}}
