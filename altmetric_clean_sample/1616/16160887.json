Analyses are presented of 562 time-sampled morning commutes to work made by 363 randomly sampled people in three different Swedish cities asking them to use smartphones to report their mood in their home before and directly after the commutes. These reports as well as satisfaction with the commute obtained in summer and winter are linked to weather data and analyzed by means of fixed-effects regression analyses. The results reveal main effects of weather (temperature and precipitation) on mood and travel satisfaction (temperature, sunshine, precipitation, and wind speed). The effects of weather on mood and travel satisfaction differ depending on travel mode. Temperature leads to a more positive mood, wind leads to higher activation for public transport users, and sunshine leads to a more negative mood for cyclists and pedestrians. Sunshine and higher temperatures make travel more relaxed although not for cycling and walking, and rain and snow lead to a higher cognitive assessed quality of travel.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc1b","authors":["Ettema, Dick","Friman, Margareta","Olsson, Lars E.","G\u00e4rling, Tommy"],"doi":"10.3389\/fpsyg.2017.00140","first_seen_on":"2017-02-06T06:09:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-1078"],"journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1486477543,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2017.00140\/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Psychology&id=234097","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2017.00140"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2017.00140\/pdf","pmid":"28220100","pubdate":"2017-02-06T20:17:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Season and Weather Effects on Travel-Related Mood and Travel Satisfaction","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2017.00140\/full","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/season-weather-effects-travelrelated-mood-travel-satisfaction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.7,"score_history":{"1y":2.7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172683,"mean":6.9158600214652,"rank":3259700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4886982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172683,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263170,"mean":12.857538638669,"rank":100638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":161116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263170,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7595,"mean":10.942568606795,"rank":3436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7595,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":860,"mean":11.872961583236,"rank":424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":860,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
