Ether failed to raise the plasma ACTH level of rats in which an antero-lateral hypothalamic cut and adrenalectomy had been performed 7 to 8 days previously. Plasma ACTH was also unchanged in rats exposed to ether 2 h after an antero-lateral cut. These data suggest that intact neural pathways entering the medial basal hypothalamus from the antero-lateral direction are necessary for the ACTH releasing action of ether stress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002832","authors":["M.
