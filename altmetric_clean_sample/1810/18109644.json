Considering the recent reports about some hazardous effects of Wi-Fi signals on the nervous system, this study aimed to investigate the effect of 2.4\u00a0GHz Wi-Fi radiation on multisensory integration in rats. This experimental study was done on 80 male Wistar rats that were allocated into exposure and sham groups. Wi-Fi exposure to 2.4\u00a0GHz microwaves [in Service Set Identifier mode (23.6\u00a0dBm and 3% for power and duty cycle, respectively)] was done for 30\u00a0days (12\u00a0h\/day). Cross-modal visual-tactile object recognition (CMOR) task was performed by four variations of spontaneous object recognition (SOR) test including standard SOR, tactile SOR, visual SOR, and CMOR tests. A discrimination ratio was calculated to assess the preference of animal to the novel object. The expression levels of M1 and GAT1 mRNA in the hippocampus were assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Results demonstrated that rats in Wi-Fi exposure groups could not discriminate significantly between the novel and familiar objects in any of the standard SOR, tactile SOR, visual SOR, and CMOR tests. The expression of M1 receptors increased following Wi-Fi exposure. In conclusion, results of this study showed that chronic exposure to Wi-Fi electromagnetic waves might impair both unimodal and cross-modal encoding of information.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003197","authors":["Amin Hassanshahi","Seyed Ali Shafeie","Iman Fatemi","Elham Hassanshahi","Mohammad Allahtavakoli","Mohammad Shabani","Ali Roohbakhsh","Ali Shamsizadeh"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10072-017-2920-y","first_seen_on":"2017-03-25T08:12:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1590-1874","1590-3478"],"journal":"Neurological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1501149356,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10072-017-2920-y","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28332042","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10072-017-2920-y","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10072-017-2920-y"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10072-017-2920-y.pdf","pmid":"28332042","pubdate":"2017-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Milan","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neuroradiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"The effect of Wi-Fi electromagnetic waves in unimodal and multimodal object recognition tasks in male rats","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s10072-017-2920-y","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-wifi-electromagnetic-waves-unimodal-multimodal-object-recognition-tasks-male-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.3,"score_history":{"1y":8.3,"6m":8.3,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":1056423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7224570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244788,"mean":13.25605011704,"rank":47448,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":197215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244788,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1026,"mean":3.6724448780488,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1026,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":14.253260869565,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
