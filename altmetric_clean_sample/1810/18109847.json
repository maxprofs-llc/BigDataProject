The AMI network is a wireless sensor network that provides communication for metering devices in the neighborhood area of the smart grid. Recently, the applicability of a routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL) has been considered in AMI networks. Some studies in the literature have pointed out problems with RPL, including sub-optimal path selection and instability. In this paper, we defend the viewpoint that careful planning of the transmission power in wireless RPL networks can significantly reduce the pointed problems. This paper presents a method for planning the transmission power in order to assure that, after convergence, the size of the parent set of the RPL nodes is as close as possible to a predefined size. Another important feature is that all nodes in the parent set offer connectivity through links of similar quality.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Marcio Miguel","Edgard Jamhour","Marcelo Pellenz","Manoel Penna","Miguel, Marcio L F","Jamhour, Edgard","Pellenz, Marcelo E","Penna, Manoel C"],"doi":"10.3390\/s17040679","first_seen_on":"2017-03-25T08:25:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"4","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1490430314,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/4\/679?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28346339?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/4\/679\/pdf","pmid":"28346339","pubdate":"2017-03-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"A Power Planning Algorithm Based on RPL for AMI Wireless Sensor Networks","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/power-planning-algorithm-based-rpl-ami-wireless-sensor-networks-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":6385412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1142231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247712,"mean":13.344294996992,"rank":178117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247712,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3477,"mean":1.9895201380898,"rank":1906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":914,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3477,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":654,"mean":1.2851117917305,"rank":212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":654,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/845552142173691905","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18109847],"posted_on":"2017-03-25T08:25:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/891043583511470080\/FfBKDjay_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
