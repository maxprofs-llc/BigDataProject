However, a majority of previous studies that have evaluated this movement limited their analysis only to the rotational movement of segments, and translational motions were not examined. Therefore, in this study, correlations between translational motions in the 3 axes, which occur between the upper torso and pelvis, were also examined.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007e2","doi":"10.1186\/1475-925x-12-13","first_seen_on":"2013-02-12T18:35:25+00:00","issns":["1475-925X"],"issue":"1","journal":"BioMedical Engineering OnLine","last_mentioned_on":1360693679,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedical-engineering-online.com\/content\/12\/1\/13\/abstract"],"pmid":"23398693","pubdate":"2013-02-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"13","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Upper torso and pelvis linear velocity during the downswing of elite golfers","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/upper-torso-pelvis-linear-velocity-during-downswing-elite-golfers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3078800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":958504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287505,"mean":6.1099944418164,"rank":196802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":55857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287505,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":315,"mean":1.7197515923567,"rank":176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":315,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.83333333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
