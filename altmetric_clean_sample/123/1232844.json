Inhibition assessment generally depends on the assumption that inhibitors affect all PCR reactions to the same extent; i.e. that the reaction of interest and the control reaction are equally susceptible to inhibition. To test this assumption we performed inhibition assessment on DNA extracts from human urine samples, fresh urine and EDTA using different PCR reactions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000798","doi":"10.1186\/1756-0500-1-70","first_seen_on":"2013-02-11T20:59:22+00:00","issns":["1756-0500"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Research Notes","last_mentioned_on":1360615020,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1756-0500\/1\/70"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/bmcresnotes\/content\/pdf\/1756-0500-1-70.pdf","pmid":"18755023","pubdate":"2008-08-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"70","subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Differential susceptibility of PCR reactions to inhibitors: an important and unrecognised phenomenon","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differential-susceptibility-pcr-reactions-inhibitors-important-unrecognised-phenomenon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.168,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.168},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632901,"mean":4.9227823810231,"rank":570263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3061293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632901,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282662,"mean":5.8759834218375,"rank":52093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":230521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282662,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1061,"mean":3.3455622641509,"rank":149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1061,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":2.435593220339,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":34,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
