The mitochondrial inner membrane is equipped with an elaborate system of channels and transporters for Ca uptake and extrusion that allows for the decoding of cytosolic Ca signals, and the storage of Ca in the mitochondrial matrix compartment. Controversy, however remains whether the fast cytosolic Ca transients underlying ECC in the beating heart are transmitted rapidly into the matrix compartment or slowly integrated by the mitochondrial Ca transport machinery. This review summarizes established and novel findings on cardiac mitochondrial Ca transport and buffering, and discusses the evidence either supporting or arguing against the idea that Ca can be taken up rapidly by mitochondria during ECC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e5b","authors":["Dedkova EN","Blatter LA"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.yjmcc.2012.12.021","first_seen_on":"2013-02-11T18:54:04+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["00222828"],"journal":"Journal of Molecular & Cellular Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1360515116,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0022282813000023"],"pmid":"23306007","pubdate":"2013-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","cardiology"],"title":"Calcium signaling in cardiac mitochondria ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/calcium-signaling-cardiac-mitochondria-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685110,"mean":4.9302723403875,"rank":2947044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71979,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685110,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282910,"mean":5.8628180722427,"rank":226418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282910,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":399,"mean":2.1026582914573,"rank":248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":399,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.4455,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
