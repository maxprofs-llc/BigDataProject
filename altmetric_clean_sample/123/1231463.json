Glutamine has been found to be the preferential nutrient to the rapidly replicating intestinal mucosa, but whether this is a metabolic effect or due to other properties of this amino acid is not determined. To study the importance of glutamine on the growth of two enterocyte-like cell lines, the effects of depriving the media or supplementing it with glutamine were assessed in media with different serum and energy supplements.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b26","authors":["Wir\u00e9n, M","Magnusson, K E","Larsson, J"],"first_seen_on":"2013-02-11T07:04:18+00:00","issns":["1357-2725"],"issue":"12","journal":"International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1360558560,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9924802"],"pmid":"9924802","pubdate":"1998-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"The role of glutamine, serum and energy factors in growth of enterocyte-like cell lines.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-glutamine-serum-energy-factors-growth-enterocytelike-cell-lines"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.048,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.048},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635033,"mean":4.9228440290343,"rank":589380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3044142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635033,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282686,"mean":5.8751506588607,"rank":53363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":229306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282686,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":779,"mean":3.3678586118252,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":779,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.9895833333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
