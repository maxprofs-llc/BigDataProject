In prior experimentation, curcumin, a naturally occurring food substance and anticarcinogenic agent, inhibited cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma xenograft growth. We hypothesize curcumin will inhibit UVB radiation-induced skin cancer growth in mice, approximating a human chemopreventive model.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c01","authors":["Cherie-Ann O.
