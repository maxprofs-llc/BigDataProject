A comprehensive search was conducted to identify eligible studies. The fixed or random effect model was used based on heterogeneity test. The dose-response relationship was assessed by restricted cubic spline model and multivariate random-effect meta-regression. Overall, 31 studies with 63,786 cases were included, and the combined relative risk (RR) with 95\u00a0% CI of breast cancer was 0.88 (0.85-0.91). In subgroup analysis by activity type, data from 27 studies including 37,568 cases for non-occupational activity (including recreational activity and household activity) and seven studies including 28,268 cases for occupational activity were used, and the RR (95\u00a0% CI) of breast cancer was 0.87 (0.83-0.91) and 0.90 (0.83-0.97), respectively. The inverse association was consistent among all subgroups analyses. Stronger association was found for subjects with BMI <25\u00a0kg\/m(2) [0.72 (0.65-0.81)], premenopausal women [0.77 (0.72-0.84)], and estrogen and progesterone receptor-negative breast cancer [0.80 (0.73-0.87)]. Dose-response analysis suggested that the risk of breast cancer decreased by 2\u00a0% (P\u00a0<\u00a00.00) for every 25 metabolic equivalent (MET)-h\/week increment in non-occupational physical activity, 3\u00a0% (P\u00a0<\u00a00.00) for every 10 MET-h\/week (roughly equivalent to 4\u00a0h\/week of walking in 2 miles\/h or 1\u00a0h\/week of running in 6 miles\/h) increment in recreational activity, and 5\u00a0% (P\u00a0<\u00a00.00) for every 2\u00a0h\/week increment in moderate plus vigorous recreational activity, respectively. Physical activity could significantly reduce the risk of breast cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006cf8","authors":["Wu Y","Zhang D","Kang S","Yili Wu","Dongfeng Zhang","Shan Kang"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10549-012-2396-7","first_seen_on":"2013-02-11T09:58:14+00:00","issns":["1573-7217","0167-6806"],"issue":"","journal":"Breast Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1475013400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23274845","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10549-012-2396-7","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10549-012-2396-7?utm_content=buffer2189b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10549-012-2396-7?utm_content=buffer47d29&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10549-012-2396-7?wt_mc=Other.Other.2.CON417crscit6","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10549-012-2396-7"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10549-012-2396-7.pdf","pmid":"23274845","pubdate":"2013-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Physical activity and risk of breast cancer: a meta-analysis of prospective studies","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s10549-012-2396-7","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physical-activity-risk-breast-cancer-metaanalysis-prospective-studies-8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":49.64,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":49.64},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":192241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8247930,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":304724,"mean":7.0508567256163,"rank":7552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":297172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":304724,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1966,"mean":7.1359022900763,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":1934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1966,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":2.9152,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":25,"researcher":6,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":25,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
