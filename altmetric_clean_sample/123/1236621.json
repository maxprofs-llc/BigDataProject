However, one third of the identified alterations are missense variants with unclear clinical significance. The functionality of these variants can be tested in the laboratory, but the results cannot be used for clinical diagnosis. We therefore aimed to establish a laboratory test that can be applied clinically.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efa","authors":["Guido Plotz"],"doi":"10.1158\/1078-0432.ccr-12-3299","first_seen_on":"2013-02-13T11:41:33+00:00","issns":["1557-3265"],"journal":"Clinical Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1366719726,"links":["http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/02\/12\/1078-0432.CCR-12-3299.abstract.html?papetoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/02\/12\/1078-0432.CCR-12-3299.full.pdf","pmid":"23403630","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Expression defect size among unclassified MLH1 variants determines pathogenicity in Lynch syndrome diagnosis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-defect-size-among-unclassified-mlh1-variants-determines-pathogenicity-lynch-syndrome-diag"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3548863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287634,"mean":6.1101024221838,"rank":231804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287634,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3978,"mean":3.7395267789791,"rank":3433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3978,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":693,"mean":4.4422601156069,"rank":645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":693,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
