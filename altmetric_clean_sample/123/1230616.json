On the basis of the FDA's administrative records, I argue that the 1938 regulations on prescription drug labeling were initiated by industry and then agreed to by the FDA; that contemporaries understood and accepted the reasons for restricting the use of certain drugs; and that the subsequent evolution of these regulations is best understood as an FDA effort to limit industry abuses of the prescription labeling system. This decade-long war of position ended when drug manufacturers persuaded the US Congress to enshrine their version of prescription labeling in law in a highly politicized struggle over government's role in the economy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221a","authors":["H M Marks"],"first_seen_on":"2013-02-10T16:32:56+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1378750393,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1615280\/pdf\/amjph00439-0111.pdf"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1615280\/pdf\/amjph00439-0111.pdf","pmid":"7832245","pubdate":"1995-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Public Health Association","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"109","title":"Revisiting \"the origins of compulsory drug prescriptions\".","type":"article","volume":"85","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/revisiting-origins-compulsory-drug-prescriptions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5573821,"mean":6.3370304484133,"rank":1173360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":4392685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5573821,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":294009,"mean":6.4475052175448,"rank":66565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":226889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":294009,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4926,"mean":14.445505380711,"rank":1988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":2931,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4926,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":19.084574074074,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Ph.
