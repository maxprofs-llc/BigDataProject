[ISME J. 2013] - PubMed - NCBI","Plasmids...carry among the largest proportion of unknown gene pools so far detected in metagenomic DNA"],"citation":{"abstract":"Plasmids have long been recognized as an important driver of DNA exchange and genetic innovation in prokaryotes. The success of plasmids has been attributed to their independent replication from the host's chromosome and their frequent self-transfer. It is thought that plasmids accumulate, rearrange and distribute nonessential genes, which may provide an advantage for host proliferation under selective conditions. In order to test this hypothesis independently of biases from culture selection, we study the plasmid metagenome from microbial communities in two activated sludge systems, one of which receives mostly household and the other chemical industry wastewater. We find that plasmids from activated sludge microbial communities carry among the largest proportion of unknown gene pools so far detected in metagenomic DNA, confirming their presumed role of DNA innovators. At a system level both plasmid metagenomes were dominated by functions associated with replication and transposition, and contained a wide variety of antibiotic and heavy metal resistances. Plasmid families were very different in the two metagenomes and grouped in deep-branching new families compared with known plasmid replicons. A number of abundant plasmid replicons could be completely assembled directly from the metagenome, providing insight in plasmid composition without culturing bias. Functionally, the two metagenomes strongly differed in several ways, including a greater abundance of genes for carbohydrate metabolism in the industrial and of general defense factors in the household activated sludge plasmid metagenome. This suggests that plasmids not only contribute to the adaptation of single individual prokaryotic species, but of the prokaryotic community as a whole under local selective conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f18","authors":["Vladimir Sentchilo","Antonia P Mayer","Lionel Guy","Ryo Miyazaki","Susannah Green Tringe","Kerrie Barry","Stephanie Malfatti","Alexander Goessmann","Marc Robinson-Rechavi","Jan R van der Meer"],"doi":"10.1038\/ismej.2013.13","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-02-14T16:19:54+00:00","issns":["1751-7362","1751-7370"],"journal":"ISME Journal: Multidisciplinary Journal of Microbial Ecology","last_mentioned_on":1370515562,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ismej\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ismej201313a.html"],"pmid":"23407308","pubdate":"2013-02-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["environmentalhealth","microbiology"],"title":"Community-wide plasmid gene mobilization and selection","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/communitywide-plasmid-gene-mobilization-selection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7528769,"mean":6.5067992380654,"rank":1146758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6376730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7528769,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299738,"mean":6.7342721118848,"rank":54405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":245093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299738,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1450,"mean":11.178968944099,"rank":638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1450,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":8.3022068965517,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":8,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":8,"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":35,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
