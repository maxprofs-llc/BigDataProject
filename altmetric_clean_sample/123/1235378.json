Animal models have been used to elucidate asthma pathophysiology, and to identify and evaluate novel therapeutic targets. Several recent review articles (Epstein, 2004; Lloyd, 2007; Boyce and Austen, 2005; Zosky and Sly, 2007) have discussed the potential value of these models. Allergen challenge models reproduce many features of clinical asthma and have been widely used by investigators; however, the majority involve acute allergen challenge procedures. It is recognised that asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease resulting from continued or intermittent allergen exposure, usually via inhalation, and there has been a recent focus on developing chronic allergen exposure models, predominantly in mice. Here, we review the acute and chronic exposure mouse models, and consider their potential role and impact in the field of asthma research.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000714a","authors":["Anthony T.
