Conversely, covalent linkage formation is an important mechanism for a quantity of successful drugs in the market, which are discovered in most cases by hindsight instead of systematical design. In this article, the implementation of a docking-based virtual screening workflow for the retrieval of covalent binders is presented considering human cathepsin K as a test case. By use of the docking conditions that led to the best enrichment of known actives, 44 candidate compounds with unknown activity on cathepsin K were finally selected for experimental evaluation. The most potent inhibitor, 4-(N-phenylanilino)-6-pyrrolidin-1-yl-1,3,5-triazine-2-carbonitrile (CP243522), showed a K(i) of 21 nM and was confirmed to have a covalent reversible mechanism of inhibition. The presented approach will have great potential in cases where covalent inhibition is the desired drug discovery strategy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["J\u00f6rg Schr\u00f6der","Schroeder J","Klinger A","Oellien F","Marhoefer RJ","Duszenko M","Selzer PM"],"doi":"10.1021\/jm3013932","endpage":"1490","first_seen_on":"2013-02-12T23:36:20+00:00","issns":["0022-2623","1520-4804"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1361491200,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jm3013932","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/jm3013932"],"pmid":"23350811","pubdate":"2013-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AMER CHEMICAL SOC","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1478","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Docking-Based Virtual Screening of Covalently Binding Ligands: An Orthogonal Lead Discovery Approach","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dockingbased-virtual-screening-covalently-binding-ligands-orthogonal-lead-discovery-approach"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8059414,"mean":6.8395785174396,"rank":1946221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6074936,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8059414,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302832,"mean":6.9701902381196,"rank":83674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":217279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302832,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3963,"mean":4.3830378596668,"rank":942,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":2989,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3963,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":4.6422894736842,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":25,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
