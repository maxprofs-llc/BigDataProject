Both met US Food and Drug Administration log(10) reduction requirements after a single application and 10 consecutive applications. This is the first study to identify ABHR formulations capable of meeting efficacy requirements with a single-dispenser actuation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f610005980","authors":["Macinga DR","Edmonds SL","Campbell E","Shumaker DJ","Arbogast JW"],"doi":"10.1086\/669514","first_seen_on":"2013-02-14T10:07:47+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"Infection control and hospital epidemiology (Online)","last_mentioned_on":1360632221,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23388365"],"pmid":"23388365","pubdate":"2013-02-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nursing","hospitals","communicablediseases","epidemiology"],"title":"Efficacy of novel alcohol-based hand rub products at typical in-use volumes.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-novel-alcoholbased-hand-rub-products-typical-inuse-volumes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3624912,"mean":4.9343443616567,"rank":289170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":3322543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3624912,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282758,"mean":5.9127747288309,"rank":30602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":251374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282758,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":770,"mean":8.4472353706112,"rank":127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":770,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":6.0056428571429,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":3},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"How Hand Sanitizers Sans Alcohol Hold Up","url":"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB10001424127887324900204578286354195382458.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[1238855],"posted_on":"2013-02-12T01:23:41+00:00","summary":"For killing germs on your hands, alcohol has long been the go-to ingredient in many hand sanitizers.
