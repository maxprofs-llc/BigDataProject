Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4 Inhibitors) have been strongly associated with spending on the treatment of T2DM by the courts in Brazil. The aim of this study was to estimate the most cost-effective DPP-4 Inhibitor for T2DM treatment. A pharmacoeconomic study of cost-effectiveness was performed in a medium-sized municipality in Minas Gerais state, Brazil.\nThe data are from legalization in municipal health in 2013. The effectiveness of DPP-4 Inhibitors was measured by the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (A1c). The direct medical costs of drug and adverse drug reactions were identified. With these data, a cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) and construction of the decision tree for sensitivity analysis were performed.\nThe representative of the most effective in reducing A1c gliptins was sitagliptin in combination with metformin, it was able to reduce A1c by 1.16% (1.09 to 1.22, CI 95%). The drug with the lowest cost was linagliptin, with a cost per patient\/year of US$ 481.42. Sensitivity analysis performed by the decision tree shows that sitagliptin in association with metformin had the CER of US$ 1,506.75 per patient\/year, to reduce A1c by 1%.\nThe most cost-effective DPP-4 Inhibitor was sitagliptin with metformin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f6100070fa","authors":["Maur\u00edlio de Souza Cazarim","Estael Luzia Coelho da Cruz-Cazarim","Andr\u00e9 de Oliveira Baldoni","Thais Bueno Enes dos Santos","Paula Gon\u00e7alves de Souza","Ingrid de Almeida Silva","Roberta Niriam Reis Rodrigues","Alda Cristina Franco Correa Maia","Leonardo R\u00e9gis Leira Pereira","Cristina Sanches"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.dsx.2017.07.006","first_seen_on":"2017-09-11T17:46:04+00:00","issns":["18714021"],"journal":"Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1505148269,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28701284"],"pmid":"28701284","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Cost-effectiveness analysis of different dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitor drugs for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/costeffectiveness-analysis-different-dipeptidylpeptidase-4-inhibitor-drugs-treatment-type-2-diabetes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8397236,"mean":7.0723276090205,"rank":7258313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8397236,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122048,"mean":11.679890288168,"rank":98962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122048,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160,"mean":2.0701761006289,"rank":119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.825,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Instagram post by CPAFF-USP \u2022 Sep 11, 2017 at 3:50pm UTC","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1873050702711241&id=734166699932986","license":"public","citation_ids":[25115681],"posted_on":"2017-09-11T16:44:29+00:00","summary":"O Diabetes mellitus tipo 2 (DM2) \u00e9 uma doen\u00e7a que tem custado em torno de 500 bilh\u00f5es de d\u00f3lares por ano aos sistemas de sa\u00fade no mundo todo, sendo que a maior parte deste custo se deve a hospitaliza\u00e7\u00f5es e medicamentos utilizados para seu tratamento.
