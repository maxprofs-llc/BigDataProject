In fact, the hidden layer size is adaptive and can grow during training. This is obtained by first extending the RBM to be sensitive to the ordering of its hidden units. Then, with a carefully chosen definition of the energy function, we show that the limit of infinitely many hidden units is well defined. As with RBM, approximate maximum likelihood training can be performed, resulting in an algorithm that naturally and adaptively adds trained hidden units during learning. We empirically study the behavior of this infinite RBM, showing that its performance is competitive to that of the RBM, while not requiring the tuning of a hidden layer size.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f61000318b","authors":["Marc-Alexandre C\u00f4t\u00e9"],"doi":"10.1162\/neco_a_00848","endpage":"1288","first_seen_on":"2016-10-28T00:26:55+00:00","issns":["1530-888X","0899-7667"],"issue":"7","journal":"Neural Computation","last_mentioned_on":1477614401,"links":["http:\/\/www.mitpressjournals.org\/doi\/full\/10.1162\/NECO_a_00848#.WBKbL-oHU1M.twitter"],"pmid":"27171012","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1265","subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"An Infinite Restricted Boltzmann Machine","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/infinite-restricted-boltzmann-machine-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7607694,"mean":6.5509374902442,"rank":3933705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2132522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7607694,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235246,"mean":12.683759527301,"rank":128982,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":83760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235246,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":385,"mean":3.859953125,"rank":214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":385,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":13.91,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
