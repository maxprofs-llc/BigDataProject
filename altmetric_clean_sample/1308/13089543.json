However, this data can be used by machine learning and data mining techniques to predict patient outcomes. Learning finite-state transducers (FSTs) have been widely used in problems where sequences need to be manipulated and insertions, deletions and substitutions need to be modeled. In this paper, we learned the edit distance costs of a symbolic univariate time series representation through a stochastic finite-state transducer to predict patient outcomes in intensive care units. The Nearest-Neighbor method with these learned costs was used to classify the patient status within an hour after 10\u00a0h of data. Several experiments were developed to estimate the parameters that better fit the model regarding the prediction metrics. Our best results are compared with published works, where most of the metrics (i.e., Accuracy, Precision and F-measure) were improved.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f6100075e5","authors":["Patricia Ordo\u00f1ez","Nelson Schwarz","Adnel Figueroa-Jim\u00e9nez","Leonardo A.
