We sought to assess basal and insulin-stimulated endothelial signaling proteins (ET-1 and peNOS) in skeletal muscle from T2D patients. Ten obese T2D (glucose disposal rate (GDR): 6.6\u00b11.6 mg\/kg LBM\/min) and eleven lean insulin sensitive subjects (Lean GDR: 12.9\u00b11.2 mg\/kg LBM\/min), underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with vastus lateralis biopsies taken before and 60 min into the clamp. Basal biopsies were also taken in eleven medication- na\u00efve, obese, non-T2D subjects. ET-1, peNOS (ser1177), and eNOS protein and mRNA were measured from skeletal muscle samples containing native microvessels. Femoral artery blood flow was assessed by duplex Doppler ultrasound. Insulin-stimulated blood flow was reduced in obese T2D (Lean: +50.7\u00b16.5% baseline, T2D: +20.8\u00b15.2% baseline, p<0.05). peNOS\/eNOS content was higher in Lean under basal conditions and although not increased by insulin, remained higher in Lean during the insulin clamp than in obese T2D (p<0.05). ET-1 mRNA and peptide were 2.25\u00b10.50 and 1.52\u00b10.11 fold higher in obese T2D compared to Lean at baseline, and ET-1 peptide remained 2.02\u00b11.9 fold elevated in obese T2D after insulin infusion (p<0.05), but did not increase with insulin in either group (p>0.05). Obese non-T2D subjects tended to also display elevated basal ET-1 (p=0.06). In summary, higher basal skeletal muscle expression of ET-1 and reduced peNOS\/eNOS may contribute to a reduced insulin-stimulated leg blood flow response in obese T2D patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b71","authors":["Leryn J.
