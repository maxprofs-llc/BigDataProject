Sample treatment was optimized using protein precipitation and solid phase extraction. Chromatographic separation was carried out in a gradient mode using a core-shell C18 column (150\u2009\u00d7\u20094.6 mm, 3.6 \u00b5m) with mobile phases of acetonitrile and water containing trifluoroacetic acid at 1.0 mL\/min. The method was validated using methodology described by the Food and Drugs Administration guidelines for bioanalytical methods. Linearity was demonstrated within the 50-500 ng\/mL range and the lower limit of quantitation was 50 ng\/mL. Finally, a preliminary pharmacokinetic study after intraperitoneal injection of LR12 in rats was conducted to evaluate both LR12 monomer and its corresponding disulfide dimer, the main product of degradation. Beyond the fact that this paper describes the first fully validated method for LR12 analysis in blood samples, the approach followed here to optimize pre-analytical steps could be beneficial to develop HPLC and\/or MS methods for other pharmaceutical peptides.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c74","authors":["Parent, M.","Boudier, A.","Maincent, P.","Gibot, S.","Ait\u2010Oufella, H.","Boufenzer, A.","Jolly, L.","Derive, M.","Kouach, M.","Goossens, J.\u2010F.","Leroy, P.","Clarot, I."],"doi":"10.1002\/bmc.3877","first_seen_on":"2016-10-28T05:18:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1099-0801"],"journal":"Biomedical Chromatography","last_mentioned_on":1477631886,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bmc.3877\/abstract;jsessionid=6127B712F3F6D397205FEB42C48A012A.f01t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bmc.3877\/pdf","pmid":"27790740","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"LR12-peptide quantitation in whole blood by RP-HPLC and intrinsic fluorescence detection: validation and pharmacokinetic study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lr12peptide-quantitation-whole-blood-rphplc-intrinsic-fluorescence-detection-validation-pharmacokine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7607694,"mean":6.5509374902442,"rank":5756802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1020590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7607694,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235246,"mean":12.683706603753,"rank":162882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235246,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":638,"mean":2.4342323390895,"rank":324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":638,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/samplesprep\/statuses\/791871640598478849","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13089183],"posted_on":"2016-10-28T05:18:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Sample Preparation","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_5_normal.png","id_on_source":"samplesprep","tweeter_id":"3010341087","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":4},"tweet_id":"791871640598478849"}]}}
