One recently reported approach is the use of co-solvent systems to increase the as-obtained concentration of BNNS; the role of these solvents in aiding exfoliation and\/or aiding colloidal stability of BNNSs is difficult to distinguish. In this paper, we have investigated the use of a t-butanol\/water co-solvent to disperse BNNSs. We utilize solvent-exchange experiments to demonstrate that the t-butanol is in fact essential to colloidal stability; we then utilized molecular dynamics simulations to explore the mechanism of t-butanol\/BNNS interactions. Taken together, the experimental and simulation results show that the key to the success of t-butanol (as compared to the other alcohols of higher or lower molecular weight) lies in its ability to act as a \"liquid dispersant\" which allows it to favorably interact with both water and BNNSs. Additionally, we show that the stable dispersions of BNNS in water\/t-butanol systems may be freeze-dried to yield non-aggregated, redispersible BNNS powders, which would be useful in an array of industrial processes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fd3","authors":["Touseef Habib"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.langmuir.6b02611","first_seen_on":"2016-10-27T17:33:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5827","0743-7463"],"journal":"Langmuir","last_mentioned_on":1477615679,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.langmuir.6b02611"],"pmid":"27740775","pubdate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Cosolvents as Liquid Surfactants for Boron Nitride Nanosheet (BNNS) Dispersions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cosolvents-liquid-surfactants-boron-nitride-nanosheet-bnns-dispersions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7607694,"mean":6.5509374902442,"rank":3481953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3954223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7607694,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235498,"mean":12.671389495407,"rank":110463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":118503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235498,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2658,"mean":2.8677771923222,"rank":725,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":1868,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2658,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":4.965186440678,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
