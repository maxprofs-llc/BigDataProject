Immunity from OMVs comes from immunoglobulin (Ig), particularly IgG, in the milk of mucosally immunized dams. Anti-OMV IgG renders Vibrio cholerae immotile, thus they pass through the small intestine without colonizing. However, the importance of motility inhibition for protection, and the mechanism by which motility is inhibited, remain unclear. By using both in vitro and in vivo experiments, we found that IgG inhibits motility by specifically binding to the O-antigen of V. cholerae We demonstrate that the bivalent structure of IgG, although not required for binding to the O-antigen, is required for motility inhibition. Finally, we show using competition assays in suckling mice that inhibition of motility appears to responsible for most if not all of the protection engendered by OMV vaccination, thus providing insight into the mechanism of immune protection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007771","authors":["Zhu Wang","David W.
