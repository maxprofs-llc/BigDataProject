They run exclusively on woody biomass, which has favorable properties for conversion with fast pyrolysis. In order to increase the synergies of food production and the energetic and\/or material use of biomass, it is desirable to utilize residues from agricultural production, e.g., straw. The presented method is suitable for converting such a material on an industrial scale. The main features are presented and an example of mass balances from the conversion of several biomass residues is given. After conversion, fractionated condensation is applied in order to retrieve two condensates - an organic-rich and an aqueous-rich one. This design prevents the production of fast pyrolysis bio-oil that exhibits phase separation. A two phase bio-oil is to be expected because of the typically high ash content of straw biomass, which promotes the production of water of reaction during conversion. Both fractionated condensation and the use of biomass with high ash content demand a careful approach for establishing balances. Not all kind of balances are both meaningful and comparable to other results from the literature. Different balancing methods are presented, and the information that can be derived from them is discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f23","authors":["Axel Funke","Daniel Richter","Andreas Niebel","Nicolaus Dahmen","J\u00f6rg Sauer"],"doi":"10.3791\/54395","first_seen_on":"2016-10-27T18:01:14+00:00","issns":["1940-087X"],"issue":"115","journal":"Journal of Visualized Experiments","last_mentioned_on":1477591260,"links":["http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/54395\/fast-pyrolysis-of-biomass-residues-in-a-twin-screw-mixing-reactor"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jove.com\/pdf\/54395\/fast-pyrolysis-of-biomass-residues-in-a-twin-screw-mixing-reactor","pmid":"27684439","pubdate":"2016-09-09T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","biology"],"title":"Fast Pyrolysis of Biomass Residues in a Twin-screw Mixing Reactor","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fast-pyrolysis-biomass-residues-twinscrew-mixing-reactor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7601780,"mean":6.5482482934541,"rank":3930379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2130280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7601780,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235328,"mean":12.674040632821,"rank":129116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":83553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235328,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4011,"mean":3.22227680798,"rank":1869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4011,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211,"mean":4.6228476190476,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
