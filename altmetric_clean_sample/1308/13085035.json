We assessed expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), CD133, and CD44 as markers of CTCs with a tumor initiating cell (TIC) phenotype in PDAC patients and the relationship of this expression to patient outcomes.\nPeripheral blood from sixty consecutive PDAC patients undergoing surgical resection was obtained and processed using the Isolation by Size of Epithelial Tumor (ISET) method. Immunofluorescence was used to identify CTCs expressing cytokeratin, CD133, CD44 and ALDH.\nForty-seven patients (78%) had epithelial CTCs staining positive for pan-cytokeratin and at least one TIC marker. Forty-six patients (77%) had epithelial CTCs that labeled with antibodies to cytokeratin and ALDH. By separate analysis, 34 (57%) had cytokeratin-positive, CD133-positive, and CD44-positive (triple positive) CTCs while 40 (67%) had cytokeratin-positive, CD133-positive, CD44-negative CTCs. The remaining 13 patients did not have CTCs, as defined by cytokeratin expression. ALDH-positive CTCs and triple-positive CTCs were significantly associated with worse survival by univariate analysis, even when accounting for other significant prognostic factors (all, P<0.01). ALDH-positive CTCs, triple-positive CTCs, and dual cytokeratin- and CD133-positive CTCs were independent predictors of tumor recurrence by logistic regression analysis and associated with decreased disease free survival (all, P<0.03).\nCTCs labeling with one or more markers of TICs are found in a majority of PDAC patients and are independently predictive of decreased disease free and overall survival.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efa","authors":["Katherine E Poruk","Amanda L.
