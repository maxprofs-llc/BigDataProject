In the present study, the safety and immunogenicity of a human papillomavirus (HPV)--11 L1 VLP candidate vaccine were measured in a phase 1, dose-finding trial in humans. The vaccine was well tolerated and induced high levels of both binding and neutralizing antibodies. Marked increases in lymphoproliferation to HPV--11 L1 antigens were noted after the second vaccination. In addition, lymphoproliferation was induced after vaccination in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with heterologous L1 VLP antigens of HPV types 6 and 16. Statistically significant increases in HPV antigen--specific interferon--gamma and interleukin-5 production were measured from PBMC culture supernatants. This candidate HPV VLP vaccine induced robust B and T cell responses, and T cell helper epitopes appear to be conserved across HPV types.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","authors":["Thomas G.
