The purpose of this study is to find how nicotine may complicate myocardial ischemia by affecting the thromboxane\/prostacyclin (TXA(2)\/PGI(2)) balance. We used four groups (n=7 each) of isolated and perfused rabbit hearts according to Langendorff method: (i) control group; (ii) group submitted to 1 microM nicotine perfusion during 60 min; (iii) group submitted to a regional ischemia by ligation of the left descending coronary artery during 60 min and (iv) group submitted to nicotine perfusion during ischemia. Levels of TXB(2) and 6-keto PGF(1alpha), the stable metabolites of TXA(2) and PGI(2) were then determined in the microsomes of the hearts by radioimmunoassay. The results showed that (1) a TXA(2) synthetase activity is present in the myocardium, and this activity, as well as that of PGI(2) synthetase, is decreased by a 60min ischemia; (2) TXA(2) and PGI(2) activities are not affected by nicotine in the normal myocardium and (3) nicotine infusion during ischemia contributes to the increase of TXA(2)\/PGI(2) ratio further by decreasing PGI(2). Therefore, these results provide one explanation on how nicotine might worsen myocardial ischemia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008641","authors":["R Nemr","B Lasserre","R
