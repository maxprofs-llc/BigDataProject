Prevalence rates are the highest for adolescents. Despite the high prevalence rates, sequelae of genital warts, dysplasia, and cancer are rare developments. Knowledge about the natural history, virology, and cancerous transformation has lead to improved viral detection, including the use of HPV DNA detection tests, screening efforts for HPV-related precancerous and cancerous lesions, and clinical interventions and treatments, including both therapeutic and prophylactic vaccinations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005cd7","authors":["Marcia L.
