We sought to assess the relationship between TL and risk of future MI in 915 healthy participants (51.7% women) 65 years or older from a population-based prospective cohort (the HUNT 2 study, Norway). Mean TL was measured by quantitative PCR expressed as relative T (telomere repeat copy number) to S (single copy gene number) ratio, and log-transformed. During a mean follow up of 13.0 (SD, 3.2) years and 11 923 person-years, 82 participants were diagnosed with MI. We used Cox proportional hazard regressions to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Relative TL was associated with age in women (P=0.01), but not in men (P=0.43). Using relative TL as a continuous variable, we observed a higher risk of MI in participants with longer telomeres with HRs of 2.46 (95% CI; 1.13 to 4.54) in men, and 2.93 (95% CI; 1.41 to 6.10) in women. Each 1-SD change in relative TL was associated with a HR of 1.54 (95% CI; 1.15 to 2.06) and 1.67 (95% CI; 1.18 to 2.37) in men and women, respectively. Compared with the bottom tertile of relative TL, HR of incident MI in top tertile was 2.71 (95% CI; 1.25 to 5.89) in men, and 3.65 (95% CI; 1.35 to 9.90) in women. Longer telomeres in healthy participants 65 years or older are associated with a high risk of incident MI. Future large scale prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the potential association between TL and MI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c61","authors":["Ida Beate \u00d8yen \u00d8sthus","Stian Lydersen","H\u00e5vard Dalen","Javaid Nauman","Ulrik Wisl\u00f8ff"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pcad.2017.04.001","first_seen_on":"2017-05-16T07:46:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00330620"],"journal":"Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1494920785,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S003306201730052X"],"pmid":"28442329","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Association of Telomere Length with Myocardial Infarction: A Prospective Cohort from the Population Based HUNT 2 study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-telomere-length-myocardial-infarction-prospective-cohort-population-based-hunt-2-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8213437,"mean":6.9553152651275,"rank":7107779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8213437,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238575,"mean":12.362843034027,"rank":193957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238575,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":317,"mean":12.071430379747,"rank":276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":317,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":12.125,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FitGreyStrong\/statuses\/864386539870052356","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20181507],"posted_on":"2017-05-16T07:46:25+00:00","author":{"name":"FitGreyStrong","url":"http:\/\/www.FitGreyStrong.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/895851067702878208\/loXgH5ZF_normal.jpg","description":"Fusing theory, science & know-how | Gen X & Baby Boomers | Sean Wilson | Exercise Scientist | Researcher | Blogger | Trainer | Lifter | tweets \u2260 advice","id_on_source":"FitGreyStrong","tweeter_id":"4034760860","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":931},"tweet_id":"864386539870052356"}]}}
