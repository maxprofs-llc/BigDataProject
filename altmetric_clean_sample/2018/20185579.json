The replacement of oxygen atoms in sugars with sulfur forms thio-sugars, which are potentially useful for the treatment of diabetes and some bacterial and viral infections. Here, we evaluated the antibacterial activity of thio-functionalized carbohydrate derivatives. A set of 21 compounds was screened against acid-fast Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), gram-negative Escherichia coli and gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The tested carbohydrate derivatives were most effective against tubercle bacilli, with as many as five compounds (thioglycoside 6, thiosemicarbazone 16A, thiosemicarbazone 20, aminothiadiazole 23, and thiazoline 26) inhibiting its growth with MIC50 \u2264 50 \u00b5M\/CFU. Only two compounds (aminothiadiazole 23 and thiazoline 26) were able to inhibit the growth of E. coli at concentrations below 1 mM, and one of them, aminothiadiazole 23, inhibited the growth of S. aureus at a concentration \u22641 mM. The five compounds affecting the growth of mycobacteria were either thiodisaccharides (6, 16A, and 20) or thioglycosides (23 and 26). All of these compounds (6, 16A, 20, 23, and 26) were able to inhibit the growth of Mtb deposited within human macrophages. However, three of the five selected compounds (6, 23, and 26) exhibited relatively high cytotoxicity in mouse fibroblasts at micromolar concentrations. The selected thio-sugars are very promising compounds, thus making them candidates for further modifications that would decrease their cytotoxicity against eukaryotic cells without affecting their antimycobacterial potential.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Ma\u0142gorzata Korycka-Macha\u0142a","Anna Brzostek","Bo\u017cena Dziadek","Malwina Kawka","Tomasz Pop\u0142awski","Zbigniew Witczak","Jaros\u0142aw Dziadek","Korycka-Macha\u0142a, Ma\u0142gorzata","Brzostek, Anna","Dziadek, Bo\u017cena","Kawka, Malwina","Pop\u0142awski, Tomasz","Witczak, Zbigniew","Dziadek, Jaros\u0142aw"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules22050812","first_seen_on":"2017-05-16T11:32:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"5","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1495017788,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/5\/812?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28509874?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/5\/812\/pdf","pmid":"28509874","pubdate":"2017-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Evaluation of the Mycobactericidal Effect of Thio-functionalized Carbohydrate Derivatives","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-mycobactericidal-effect-thiofunctionalized-carbohydrate-derivatives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":4132463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3877037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238801,"mean":12.375448869347,"rank":120820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":107814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238801,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3843,"mean":2.166276418532,"rank":999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":2673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3843,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":356,"mean":1.0996901408451,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":356,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
