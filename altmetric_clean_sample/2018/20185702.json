Here, we fabricate a hybrid organic tandem solar cell whose top and bottom subcells have polymer:fullerene and small molecules active layers, respectively, by a solvent-free process based on transferring the polymer:fullerene layer from an elastomeric stamp onto a vacuum-deposited bottom subcell. The interface between small-molecule and transferred polymer:fullerene layers is void-free at the nanoscale, allowing for efficient charge transport across the interface. Consequently, the transfer-fabricated tandem cell has an open-circuit voltage (V OC) almost identical to the sum of V OC values for the single-junction devices. The short-circuit current density (J SC) of the tandem cell is maximized by current matching achieved by varying the thickness of the small-molecule active layer in the bottom subcell, which is verified by numerical simulations. The optimized transfer-fabricated tandem cell, whose active layers are composed of poly[2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl]]:[6,6]-Phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester and Di-[4-(N,N-di-p-tolyl-amino)-phenyl]cyclohexane:C70, has V OC\u2009=\u20091.46\u2009V, J SC\u2009=\u20098.48\u2009mA\/cm(2), a fill factor of 0.51, leading to the power-conversion efficiency of 6.26%, the highest among small molecule-polymer:fullerene hybrid tandem solar cells demonstrated so far.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Yoonseok Ka","Hyejin Hwang","Changsoon Kim"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-02181-6","first_seen_on":"2017-05-16T11:42:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1494935092,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-02181-6?WT.feed_name=subjects_materials-science"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-02181-6.pdf","pmid":"28512333","pubdate":"2017-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"1942","subjects":["science"],"title":"Hybrid Organic Tandem Solar Cell Comprising Small-Molecule Bottom and Polymer:Fullerene Top Subcells Fabricated by Thin-Film Transfer","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hybrid-organic-tandem-solar-cell-comprising-smallmolecule-bottom-polymerfullerene-top-subcells-fabri"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8213437,"mean":6.9553152651275,"rank":5944884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1976673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8213437,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238575,"mean":12.362775759303,"rank":154908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":69779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238575,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34750,"mean":14.836212610435,"rank":23488,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":9507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34750,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2985,"mean":16.919452412869,"rank":1899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2985,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
