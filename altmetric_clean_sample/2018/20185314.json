The FO nanoprobe was created by constructing arrays of metallic nanostructures on the end facets of optical fibers utilizing nanofabrication technologies, including electron beam lithography and lift-off processes. The LSPR-FO nanoprobe device offers real-time, label-free, and low-sample-volume quantification of single-strand DNA in water with high sensitivity and selectivity, achieving a limit of detection around 10 fM. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the LSPR-FO nanoprobe device as a compact and low-cost biosensor for detection of short-strand DNA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002247","authors":["Savannah Kaye","Zheng Zeng","Mollye Sanders","Krishnan Chittur","Paula M Koelle","Robert Lindquist","Upender Manne","Yongbin Lin","Jianjun Wei"],"doi":"10.1039\/c7an00249a","first_seen_on":"2017-05-16T11:17:22+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"handles":[],"issns":["0003-2654","1364-5528"],"journal":"Analyst","last_mentioned_on":1494933426,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28504795?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28504795","pubdate":"2017-05-16T22:02:26+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Label-Free Detection of DNA Hybridization with A Compact LSPR-based Fiber-Optic Sensor","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8213437,"mean":6.9553152651275,"rank":7107768,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8213437,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238575,"mean":12.362778483825,"rank":193952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238575,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2115,"mean":2.943302743614,"rank":1706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2115,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":3.9716666666667,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BiosensorPapers\/statuses\/864439561551622144","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20185314],"posted_on":"2017-05-16T11:17:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Biosensor Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/706647650213363712\/BpK5-z3e_normal.jpg","description":"Pubmed Twitterbot for #biosensor papers.
