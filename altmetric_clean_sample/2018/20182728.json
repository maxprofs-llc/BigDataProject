Our study aimed to establish correlations between oxidative stress biomarkers and key reproductive fitness parameters in the temperate sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus following exposure to dietary polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAH-exposed adults exhibited total gonad tissue concentrations of PAHs in excess of 4 and 5 times baseline levels, for females and males respectively. Antioxidant enzymes were upregulated and oxidative lipid and protein damage to gonad tissues occurred. In addition, early stage offspring reflected maternal antioxidant status, with progeny derived from exposed females demonstrating significantly higher baselines than those derived from control females. Maternal exposure history enhanced the capacity of embryos to minimise oxidative damage to lipids and proteins following exposure to additional PAHs, but provided less of an advantage in protection against oxidative DNA damage. Abnormal embryonic development was largely independent of oxidative damage, remaining high in all embryo populations regardless of parental PAH-history. Overall, results document evidence for maternal transfer of antioxidant potential in E. chloroticus, but imply that a short-term inherited resilience against oxidative stress may not necessarily translate to a fitness or survival gain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Kathryn N.
