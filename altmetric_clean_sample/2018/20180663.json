However, the exact prevalence of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is largely unknown as underdiagnosis and underreporting are common.\nTo evaluate epidemiological, clinico-pathological and microbiological aspects of CL cases occurring in the Bologna province, north-eastern Italy.\nWe performed a retrospective, observational study on CL cases diagnosed in the Bologna province between January 2013 and December 2015.\nDuring 2013-2015, 30 cases of CL were identified in the Bologna province with an average incidence of 1.00\/100,000, with an increase of 4-12 fold as compared to previous years. 16\/30 (53%) CL cases presented as single, typical lesions. CL diagnosis was carried out by histological and molecular techniques, although in 6 out of 29 (21%) PCR-positive cases amastigotes were not visible on histology.\nWe report new evidence of CL cases in a focal area of north-eastern Italy in 2013-2015. Our study highlights the importance of CL surveillance in the Mediterranean basin and emphasizes the need for the molecular laboratory surveillance of CL in endemic areas.
