In addition, the present study provides further evidence of the involvement of circulating vasopressin and cardiac sympathetic activity in cardiovascular responses to hemorrhage. Systemic treatment with the V1-vasopressin receptor antagonist dTyr(CH2)5(Me)AVP (50\u03bcg\/kg, i.v.) increased the latency to the onset of hypotension during hemorrhage and slowed post-bleeding recovery of blood pressure. Systemic treatment with the \u03b21-adrenergic receptor antagonist atenolol (1mg\/kg, i.v.) also increased the latency to the onset of hypotension during hemorrhage. Moreover, atenolol reversed the hemorrhage-induced tachycardia into bradycardia. Bilateral microinjection of the selective NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist LY235959 (2nmol\/100nL) into the PVN blocked the hypotensive response to hemorrhage and reduced the tachycardia during the post-hemorrhage period. Systemic treatment with dTyr(CH2)5(Me)AVP inhibited the effect of LY235959 on hemorrhage-induced hypotension, without affecting the post-bleeding tachycardia. PVN treatment with the selective non-NMDA receptor antagonist NBQX (2nmol\/100nL) reduced the recovery of blood pressure to normal levels in the post-bleeding phase and reduced hemorrhage-induced tachycardia. Combined blockade of both NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptors in the PVN completely abolished the hypotensive response in the hemorrhage period and reduced the tachycardiac response in the post-hemorrhage period. These results indicate that local PVN glutamate neurotransmission is involved in the neural pathway mediating cardiovascular responses to hemorrhage, via an integrated control involving autonomic nervous system activity and vasopressin release into the circulation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031aa","authors":["Busnardo, Cristiane","Crestani, Carlos C","Fassini, Aline","Resstel, Leonardo B M","Corr\u00eaa, Fernando M A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuroscience.2016.02.003","first_seen_on":"2016-02-11T12:01:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-7544"],"journal":"Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1455191888,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26861418?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26861418"],"pmid":"26861418","pubdate":"2016-02-11T22:01:17+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptors in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus modulate different stages of hemorrhage-evoked cardiovascular responses in rats.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nmda-nonnmda-glutamate-receptors-paraventricular-nucleus-hypothalamus-modulate-different-stages-hemo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7182236,"mean":6.3148176187464,"rank":6189728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7182236,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320133,"mean":9.5767467607109,"rank":265861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320133,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3024,"mean":3.7693933178961,"rank":2532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3024,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154,"mean":3.7915816993464,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
