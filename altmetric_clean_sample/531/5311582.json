Declines in milk production and composition are caused by multiple factors, including cow factors, microorganisms and treatments, but the influence of each factor has not been determined. To investigate risk factors for milk loss after treatment for acute coliform mastitis, multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted in 53 clinical cases. Systemic administration of fluoroquinolone was significantly associated with recovery of marketable milk production. The time to slaughter was significantly shorter in cows with complete loss of quarter milk production than in cows that produced marketable milk. In this study, we identified factors associated with increased risk of milk production loss.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f1f","authors":["Shinozuka, Yasunori","Kaneko, Sohei","Kurose, Tomoyasu","Watanabe, Aiko","Kuruhara, Kana","Kawai, Kazuhiro"],"doi":"10.1292\/jvms.15-0689","first_seen_on":"2016-02-11T12:37:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1347-7439"],"journal":"Journal of Veterinary Medical Science","last_mentioned_on":1455194168,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26860356?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26860356","pubdate":"2016-02-11T22:01:51+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Factors associated with marketable milk production recovery after treatment of naturally occurring acute coliform mastitis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factors-associated-marketable-milk-production-recovery-after-treatment-naturally-occurring-acute-col"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7182236,"mean":6.3148176187464,"rank":5403103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":992655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7182236,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320133,"mean":9.5767681581345,"rank":222015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":54269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320133,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1375,"mean":0.98156768558952,"rank":546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1375,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171,"mean":0.94105882352941,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jvms_japan\/statuses\/697761030307315712","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5311582],"posted_on":"2016-02-11T12:36:08+00:00","author":{"name":"jvms_japan","url":"http:\/\/jsvetsci.jp\/jvms\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1898235853\/twitter-icon_normal.gif","id_on_source":"jvms_japan","tweeter_id":"524151017","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":35},"tweet_id":"697761030307315712"}]}}
