All consenting participants were screened for cough and by chest X-ray. Participants with presumptive TB submitted two sputum samples for smear microscopy, culture, and molecular testing if needed. The TB prevalence estimates were adjusted for missing data and the cluster design.\nOf 131,329 eligible individuals, 105,913 (81%) participated in the survey, of whom 10,471 (9.9%) were eligible for sputum examination. We found 341 bacteriologically positive TB cases of whom 233 had sputum smear-positive TB. The adjusted prevalence estimates for smear and bacteriologically positive TB were 270\/100,000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 217-323), and 398\/100,000 (95% CI 333-463), respectively. Only 61% of the diagnosed TB cases screened positive on symptoms (cough >2wks), whereas the other TB cases were detected based on X-ray abnormalities. The TB prevalence increased with age and was 1.8 times higher among men than women. The prevalence-to-notification ratio of smear-positive TB was 3.1 (95% CI 2.5-3.7), was higher among men than women, and increased with age.\nOur data suggest that there is under-detection and\/or -notification of TB, especially among men and elderly. TB control should be strengthened specifically in these risk groups. X-ray examination should be combined with symptom screening to enhance case detection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Ejaz Qadeer","Razia Fatima","Aashifa Yaqoob","Sabira Tahseen","Mahboob Ul Haq","Abdul Ghafoor","Muhammad Asif","Masja Straetemans","Edine W.
