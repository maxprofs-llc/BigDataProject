In sex-specific models, independent correlates of weekly NMPO use were identified via modified stepwise Poisson regression.\nOf 199 participants, the mean age was 24.6, and 65.3% were male. The racial composition was 16.6% black, 60.8% white, and 22.1% mixed or other race. A total of 119 (59.8%) participants reported weekly or greater NMPO use. The majority of male (86.2%) and female (84.1%) participants reported ever experiencing severe pain. A majority of males (72.3%) and females (81.2%) reported that they engaged in NMPO use to treat their physical pain, and one-quarter (26.9%) of males and one-third (36.2%) of females had been denied a prescription from a doctor to treat severe pain. Among males, frequent NMPO use was independently associated with white race (P\u200a<\u200a0.001) and reporting greater physical pain (P\u200a=\u200a0.002). Among females, older age (P\u200a=\u200a0.002) and monthly or greater nonmedical benzodiazepine use (P\u200a=\u200a0.001) were independently associated with weekly NMPO use.\nAmong young men in Rhode Island, physical pain may be related to frequent NMPO use. More research is needed to identify sex-specific, pain-related factors that are linked with NMPO use to improve harm reduction and pain management interventions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b40","authors":["Evans, Tristan I.","Liebling, Elliott J.","Green, Traci C.","Hadland, Scott E.","Clark, Melissa A.","Marshall, Brandon D.L.","Tristan I Evans","Elliott J Liebling","Traci C Green","Scott E Hadland","Melissa A Clark","Brandon D L Marshall"],"doi":"10.1097\/adm.0000000000000318","first_seen_on":"2017-05-17T20:07:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1932-0620","1935-3227"],"journal":"Journal of Addiction Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1499022610,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/journaladdictionmedicine\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Associations_Between_Physical_Pain,_Pain.99553.aspx","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28514234\/","http:\/\/insights.ovid.com\/crossref?an=01271255-900000000-99553&utm_content=buffer7a778&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/journaladdictionmedicine\/9000\/00000\/Associations_Between_Physical_Pain,_Pain.99553.pdf","pmid":"28514234","pubdate":"2017-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Associations Between Physical Pain, Pain Management, and Frequency of Nonmedical Prescription Opioid Use Among Young Adults","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/journaladdictionmedicine\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Associations_Between_Physical_Pain,_Pain.99553.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/associations-between-physical-pain-pain-management-frequency-nonmedical-prescription-opioid-among-yo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":54.45,"score_history":{"1y":54.45,"6m":54.45,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":54.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":175693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8278348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246594,"mean":12.702322361137,"rank":11119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":235469,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246594,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":683,"mean":12.616401759531,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":683,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":36.45,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":15,"researcher":3,"practitioner":9,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":9,"Members of the public":15,"Scientists":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":17,"CA":1,"GB":1,"ZA":1,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Pain linked to non-medical prescription opioid use in young adults","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=30602521718&p=1pl&v=1&x=8cJJcnAWbMmVKZ0C61NQDA","license":"public","citation_ids":[20240809,20240809],"posted_on":"2017-05-17T04:00:00+00:00","summary":"May 17, 2017 -
