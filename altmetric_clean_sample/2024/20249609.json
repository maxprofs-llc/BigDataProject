The consequences emphasize the need to screen systematically for an increased fall risk and a\u00a0targeted multifactorial and multidisciplinary approach. This study describes the extent to which fall prevention strategies are applied by primary healthcare workers in Flanders. Insight in barriers is provided.\nAn online survey was collected by the Centre of Expertise for Falls and fracture Prevention Flanders.\n1483 respondents are included. 93% are confronted monthly with falls. 96% believe they can make a\u00a0positive contribution to fall prevention. At least once a\u00a0year, respondents inquire about falls (62%) and screen for gait\/balance problems (84%). A\u00a0multifactorial assessment is performed in case of a\u00a0recent fall (95%) or an increased fall risk (76%). Most frequently respondents give advice on safe environment\/behaviour (93%), walking aid (91%), personal alarm system (89%) and footwear (85%). Unmotivated older persons (75%) who ignore their fall risk (85%), insufficient time (60%), financial compensation (54%), staff (50%), communication (31%) and knowledge (23%) are important barriers.\nAlthough respondents are aware of the importance of fall prevention, these results reveal a\u00a0necessity of sufficient knowledge, structured multidisciplinary cooperation and a\u00a0clear policy. Raising awareness of older persons remains crucial.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b81","authors":["Greet Leysens","Ellen Vlaeyen","Deborah Vanaken","Elise Janssens","Eddy Dejaeger","Dirk Cambier","Evelien Gielen","Stefan Goemaere","Olivia Vandeput","Koen Milisen"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12439-017-0215-7","first_seen_on":"2017-05-18T03:47:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0167-9228","1875-6832"],"journal":"Tijdschrift voor Gerontologie en Geriatrie","last_mentioned_on":1495079251,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28466244"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12439-017-0215-7.pdf","pmid":"28466244","pubdate":"2017-05-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Bohn Stafleu van Loghum","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Geriatrics\/Gerontology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Het toepassen van valpreventiemaatregelen bij thuiswonende ouderen: een survey onderzoek in Vlaanderen","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/het-toepassen-van-valpreventiemaatregelen-bij-thuiswonende-ouderen-een-survey-onderzoek-vlaanderen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":4135905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3877908,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234025,"mean":12.379532663316,"rank":118171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":105901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234025,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":4.3422857142857,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":18.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NoFalls_SMC\/statuses\/865051197245345792","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20249609],"posted_on":"2017-05-18T03:47:31+00:00","author":{"name":"NoFalls","url":"http:\/\/www.smcfallprevention.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/733862838502969346\/rim17Udh_normal.jpg","description":"The Fall Prevention Coalition of San Mateo County informs, collaborates and raises awareness to prevent falls among older adults living in our community.","id_on_source":"NoFalls_SMC","tweeter_id":"3323152152","geo":{"lt":37.56299,"ln":-122.32553,"country":"US"},"followers":237},"tweet_id":"865051197245345792"}],"facebook":[{"title":"[The use of fall prevention strategies in home care: a\u00a0survey in Flanders]. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1531991926820291&id=139337489419082","license":"public","citation_ids":[20249609,20249609],"posted_on":"2017-05-18T03:47:03+00:00","summary":"Tijdschr Gerontol Geriatr. 2017 May 2. doi: 10.1007\/s12439-017-0215-7.
