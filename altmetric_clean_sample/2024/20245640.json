This review summarizes these associations and in particular the role of the viral latent genes in the transformation process.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d03","authors":["K R Baumforth","L S Young","K J Flavell","C Constandinou","P G Murray"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-17T23:35:36+00:00","issns":["1366-8714"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Clinical Pathology -- Molecular Pathology Edition","last_mentioned_on":1495055076,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC395716\/"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC395716\/pdf\/520307.pdf","pmcid":"PMC395716","pmid":"10748864","pubdate":"1999-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"307","subjects":["molecularbiology","pathology"],"title":"The Epstein-Barr virus and its association with human cancers.","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epsteinbarr-virus-association-human-cancers-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":1193653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6951152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233550,"mean":12.370892737712,"rank":48522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":183139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233550,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":11.314756756757,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
