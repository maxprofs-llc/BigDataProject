We are presently witnessing, presently, major transformations in western societies. Chronic diseases affect a growing proportion of the population, leading a transition from the ascendancy of acute care to an ascendancy of chronic care. Other societal factors such as the consumerism, the individualism, the democratization of the medical information (accelerated by the advent of Internet) and the casualization of a growing part of citizens influence this evolution. In this context, where the nature and the level of patients and their families needs are changing as their expectations towards healthcare systems, one of the promising ways to answer these stakes is a greater participation of patients in their own care. Since 2010, a new relational model, based on the partnership of care between patients and healthcare professionals, was developed in the medicine Faculty of the University of Montreal. This model leans on the recognition of the experiential knowledge of the patients in complementarity with the scientific knowledge of the healthcare professionals. It's the continuity of the participation and the engagement of patients which can be applied to the whole healthcare system, in individual or collective relationship in interdisciplinary. This model is presently in implementation phase in Quebec in the training of the healthcare professionals, in healthcare organisations, as well as in the medical education and in research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8663cf058f61000c608","authors":["Flora, Luigi","Berkesse, Alexandre","Payot, Antoine","Dumez, Vincent","Karazivan, Philippe"],"first_seen_on":"2016-06-19T15:11:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1145-0762"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Journal International de Bio\u00e9thique","last_mentioned_on":1467794641,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27305793"],"pmid":"27305793","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["ethics"],"title":"[THE APPLICATION OF AN INTEGRATED MODEL OF PARTNERSHIP- PATIENT IN THE PROFESSIONALS OF THE HEALTH TRAINING: TOWARDS NEW ONE HUMANIST PARADIGM AND ETHICS OF CO-CONSTRUCTION KNOWLEDGES IN HEALTH].","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/application-integrated-model-partnership-patient-professionals-health-training-towards-new-one-human"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002013,"mean":6.750266627688,"rank":3733215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4090762,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002013,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263518,"mean":11.516925086427,"rank":119554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":135452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263518,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.18,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
