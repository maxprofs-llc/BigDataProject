The mean age (SD) in years was 46.1 (14.9) for CLE, 52.2 (14.5) for DM, 51.8 (13.5) for PV, 71.44 (11.8) for BP, and 48.2 (18.2) for healthy control subjects. The incidence of zoster was significantly higher in the CLE (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0177) and DM (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0070) groups than the healthy control subjects, all of whom were of a similar mean age.\nThe limitations of this study are the sample size, referral bias, and retrospective nature.\nThe incidence of zoster in patients with CLE and, particularly, DM was significantly higher than that of the healthy control subjects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e8d","authors":["Robinson, Elizabeth S","Payne, Aimee S","Pappas-Taffer, Lisa","Feng, Rui","Werth, Victoria P","Elizabeth S.
