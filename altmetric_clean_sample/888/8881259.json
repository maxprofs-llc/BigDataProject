However, how patient immune profiles are associated with clinical outcomes has not yet been completely elucidated. In this study, 37 MS patients were assessed for neurological outcomes, thymic function and long-term immune reconstitution after AHSCT. Patients were followed for a mean (SD) of 68.5 (13.9) months post-transplantation and were retrospectively clustered into progression- and non-progression groups, based on Expanded Disease Status Scale (EDSS) outcomes at last visit. After AHSCT, both patient groups presented increased regulatory T-cell subset counts, early expansion of central- and effector-memory CD8(+)T-cells and late thymic reactivation. However, the non-progression group presented early expansion of PD-1-expressing CD8(+)T-cells. Here, we suggest that along with increased numbers of regulatory T-cell subsets, PD-1 inhibitory signaling is one possible immunoregulatory mechanism by which AHSCT restores immune tolerance in MS patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255c","authors":["Arruda, Lucas C M","de Azevedo, J\u00falia T C","de Oliveira, Gislane L V","Scortegagna, Gabriela T","Rodrigues, Evandra S","Palma, Patr\u00edcia V B","Brum, Doralina G","Guerreiro, Carlos T","Marques, Vanessa D","Barreira, Amilton A","Covas, Dimas T","Sim\u00f5es, Belinda P","Voltarelli, J\u00falio C","Oliveira, Maria Carolina","Malmegrim, Kelen C R","Lucas C.M.
