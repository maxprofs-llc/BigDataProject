High-affinity and specific aptamers for a variety of mycotoxins have been reported over the past decade. Increasingly, these molecular recognition elements are finding applications in biosensors and assays for the detection of mycotoxins in a variety of complex matrixes. This review article highlights the mycotoxin aptamers that are available for mycotoxin detection and the array of biosensing platforms into which they have been incorporated. Key advantages that aptamers have over analogous technology, and areas in which these advantages may be applied for the benefit of practical mycotoxin detection, are also discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c8b","authors":["Goudreau, Daniel N","Ruscito, Annamaria","Smith, McKenzie","DeRosa, Maria C"],"doi":"10.5740\/jaoacint.16-0114","first_seen_on":"2016-06-19T10:24:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1060-3271"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of AOAC International","last_mentioned_on":1466331760,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27318356?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27318356","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Current Status and Future Prospects for Aptamer-Based Mycotoxin Detection","type":"article","volume":"99","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/current-status-future-prospects-aptamerbased-mycotoxin-detection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7917108,"mean":6.6979661075636,"rank":6854462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7917108,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262523,"mean":11.512048255003,"rank":219775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262523,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248,"mean":5.090032388664,"rank":180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":148.35,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
