Val d'Agri features various oil processing centers which are potentially a significant source of environmental pollution, making it essential to perform studies that will outline the state of the art on which any recovery plans and interventions may be developed. The analysis was carried out using official and accredited analytical methods based on inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and the measurements were statistically processed in order to give a contribution to risk assessment. Even though five samples showed Pb and Cd concentrations above the limits defined in the European Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881\/2006, the mean concentrations of most elements suggest that contamination in this area is low. Consequently, these results also suggest that there is no particular risk for human exposure to toxic trace elements. Nevertheless, the findings of this work confirm that element accumulation in ovine species is correlated with geographical livestock area. Therefore, ovine-specific organs might be used as bioindicators for monitoring contamination by specific toxic elements in exposed areas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006531","authors":["Miedico, Oto","Iammarino, Marco","Paglia, Giuseppe","Tarallo, Marina","Mangiacotti, Michele","Chiaravalle, A Eugenio"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10661-016-5317-0","first_seen_on":"2016-06-19T19:18:14+00:00","issns":["1573-2959","0167-6369"],"issue":"6","journal":"Environmental Monitoring & Assessment","last_mentioned_on":1466363877,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27165602"],"pmid":"27165602","pubdate":"2016-05-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atmospheric Protection\/Air Quality Control\/Air Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecotoxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Management","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Monitoring\/Analysis","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Environmental monitoring of the area surrounding oil wells in Val d\u2019Agri (Italy): element accumulation in bovine and ovine organs","type":"article","volume":"188","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/environmental-monitoring-area-surrounding-oil-wells-val-dagri-italy-element-accumulation-bovine-ovin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7917108,"mean":6.6979661075636,"rank":4152438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2208240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7917108,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262522,"mean":11.511995543213,"rank":142397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":93984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262522,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":884,"mean":2.6738505096263,"rank":401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":884,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":2.17675,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Environmental Science":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"PL":1,"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DanielaBeatrici\/statuses\/744610187097542656","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8885721],"posted_on":"2016-06-19T19:17:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Daniela Beatrici","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3297423138\/4f912dce13311d86b9e056cc0eb62430_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"DanielaBeatrici","tweeter_id":"1063230986","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":609},"tweet_id":"744610187097542656"}]}}
