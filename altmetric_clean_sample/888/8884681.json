Sixty-two female undergraduates were randomly paired and they engaged in a 6-min unstructured conversation. Interpersonal synchrony was evaluated by calculating the cross-wavelet coherence of the time-series movement data, extracted using a video-image analysis software. The existence of synchrony was tested using a pseudo-synchrony paradigm. In addition, the frequency at which the synchrony occurred and the distribution of the relative phase was explored. The results showed that the value of cross-wavelet coherence was higher in the experimental participant pairs than in the pseudo pairs. Further, the coherence value was higher in the frequency band under 0.5 Hz. These results support the validity of evaluating interpersonal synchron Behavioral mimicry and interpersonal syyby using wavelet transform even in an unstructured conversation. However, the role of relative phase was not clear; there was no significant difference between each relative-phase region. The theoretical contribution of these findings to the area of interpersonal coordination is discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc1b","authors":["Fujiwara, Ken","Daibo, Ikuo"],"doi":"10.3389\/fpsyg.2016.00516","first_seen_on":"2016-06-19T16:45:27+00:00","issns":["1664-1078"],"journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1466708869,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2016.00516\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2016.00516\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4828427","pmid":"27148125","pubdate":"2016-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Evaluating Interpersonal Synchrony: Wavelet Transform Toward an Unstructured Conversation","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluating-interpersonal-synchrony-wavelet-transform-toward-unstructured-conversation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7936934,"mean":6.7106933012983,"rank":3934238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3800486,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7936934,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262764,"mean":11.512910189029,"rank":130692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":121429,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262764,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7311,"mean":10.793436662107,"rank":4714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":2306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7311,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":341,"mean":14.275641176471,"rank":226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":341,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
