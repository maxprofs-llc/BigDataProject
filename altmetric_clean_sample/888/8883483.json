Lymphocyte stimulation testing was conducted. Periprosthetic tissue specimens underwent immunohistochemical studies.\nLymphocyte stimulation testing showed that five patients were nickel-sensitive, and one patient was also cobalt-sensitive. Immunohistochemical studies showed that T cells were dominant in five hips, and B cells were dominant in 10 hips. In four of the five patients with a positive lymphocyte stimulation test, the dominant lymphocytes were T cells, suggesting type IV hypersensitivity. The major cause of ARMD was not type IV hypersensitivity in the remaining nine patients.\nMetal hypersensitivity does not appear to be the dominant biological reaction involved in the occurrence of ARMD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ca","authors":["Masahiro Hasegawa","Masahiro Hasegawa","Takahiro Iino","Akihiro Sudo"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12891-016-1069-9","first_seen_on":"2016-06-19T14:25:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2474"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1466346304,"links":["http:\/\/bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12891-016-1069-9"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12891-016-1069-9?site=http:\/\/bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"27209084","pubdate":"2016-05-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Epidemiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rehabilitation","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sports Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["orthopedics","physiology"],"title":"Immune response in adverse reactions to metal debris following metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immune-response-adverse-reactions-metal-debris-following-metalonmetal-total-hip-arthroplasty"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7917108,"mean":6.6979661075636,"rank":6003505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1062717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7917108,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262522,"mean":11.512023540974,"rank":183907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262522,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2049,"mean":4.9725791015625,"rank":1623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2049,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":3.9717297297297,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
