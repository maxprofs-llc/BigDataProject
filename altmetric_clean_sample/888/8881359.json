A 65 year-old woman with recurrent left breast cancer presented with a non-functioning chemotherapy port in the right deltopectoral groove. She had undergone right mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). After port removal and wound closure she developed right upper extremity lymphedema. Patients who have undergone ALND may depend solely on this pathway for upper extremity lymphatic drainage.\nlevel V.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006cfb","authors":["Turfe, Zaahir","Pettinga, Jane","Leduc, Olivier","Leduc, Albert","Komorowska-Timek, Ewa"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.breast.2016.05.008","endpage":"147","first_seen_on":"2016-06-19T10:26:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-3080","09609776"],"journal":"The Breast","last_mentioned_on":1466333767,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27318169?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27318169","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"145","subjects":["neoplasms","endocrinology"],"title":"Chemotherapy port related lymphedema after axillary lymph node dissection","type":"article","volume":"28"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7917108,"mean":6.6979661075636,"rank":6003505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1062707,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7917108,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262522,"mean":11.512071156212,"rank":183911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262522,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":602,"mean":3.1562396006656,"rank":403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":602,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":2.2317857142857,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/744475997647470592","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8881359],"posted_on":"2016-06-19T10:24:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"744475997647470592"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/744483898122395648","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8881359],"posted_on":"2016-06-19T10:56:07+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"744483898122395648"}]}}
