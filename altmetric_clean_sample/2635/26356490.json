To date, the focus of registries of drugs that elicit mitochondrial toxicity has been largely restricted to those that either inhibit the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) or uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Less appreciated are the toxicities that are secondary to the drug affecting the molecular regulation, assembly or incorporation of the ETC into the inner mitochondrial membrane or those that limit substrate availability. The current article describes the complexities of molecular events and biochemical pathways required to sustain mitochondrial fidelity and substrate homeostasis with examples of drugs that interfere which the various pathways. The principal objective of this review is to shed light on the broader scope of drug-induced mitochondrial toxicities and how these secondary targets may account for a large portion of drug failures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002693","authors":["Wallace, Kendall B"],"first_seen_on":"2017-09-20T13:49:41+00:00","issns":["1875-533X"],"journal":"Current Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1505916336,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25973981"],"pmid":"25973981","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Multiple Targets for Drug-induced Mitochondrial Toxicity.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiple-targets-druginduced-mitochondrial-toxicity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0.75,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8463828,"mean":7.1089465141397,"rank":6117929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2042125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8463828,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126482,"mean":11.79459798705,"rank":81498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":37212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126482,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1078,"mean":3.3742154131848,"rank":670,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1078,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.43055555555556,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
