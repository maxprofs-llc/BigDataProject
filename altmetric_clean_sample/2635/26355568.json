When fats mobilize during pregnancy and breastfeeding, OPs could affect foetal and neonatal development, respectively.\nThe main aim of this review is to deal with pre- and post-natal external exposure to organic pollutants and their effects on health, proposing prevention measures to reduce their risk. The goal is the development of a biomonitoring framework program to estimate their impact on human health, and prevent exposure by recommending some changes in personal lifestyle habits.\nIt has been shown that new studies should be developed taking into account their cumulative effect and the factors affecting their body burden. In conclusion, several programs should continuously be developed by different health agencies to have a better understanding of the effect of these substances and to develop a unified public policy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027e3","authors":["Tania Fern\u00e1ndez-Cruz","Elena Mart\u00ednez-Carballo","Jes\u00fas Simal-G\u00e1ndara"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.envint.2017.01.001","first_seen_on":"2017-09-20T13:26:26+00:00","issns":["01604120"],"journal":"Environment International","last_mentioned_on":1505901444,"links":["http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0160412016308935"],"pmid":"28089279","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Perspective on pre- and post-natal agro-food exposure to persistent organic pollutants and their effects on quality of life","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/perspective-pre-postnatal-agrofood-exposure-persistent-organic-pollutants-effects-quality-life"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440508,"mean":7.0976499018281,"rank":4509705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2351285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440508,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113922,"mean":11.84626693937,"rank":61416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":40601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113922,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1395,"mean":10.578942611191,"rank":1041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1395,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":18.8103125,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
