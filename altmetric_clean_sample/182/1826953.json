Recent data show that fewer short forms of the D2 receptor protein are synthesized if there is a genetic variant in the D2 receptor (with a T in rs 1076560 in intron 6). At the same time, at least six publications report that the binding of radioactive benzamides is reduced in the schizophrenia thalamus. A review of the benzamide pharmacology of the short and long forms of the D2 receptor shows that benzamides have a 2.4-fold higher affinity for the D2Short receptor relative to the D2Long form. Hence, the reduced amount of benzamide binding to the D2 receptors in the schizophrenia thalamus suggests that there is a reduced amount of D2Short receptors in this diseased region, and may possibly also mean fewer presynaptic terminals because that is where D2Short receptors mostly reside. If so, fewer presynaptic dopamine terminals in various brain regions may be the basis of the known behavioural dopamine supersensitivity in schizophrenia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d3","authors":["Philip Seeman"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pscychresns.2013.09.013","first_seen_on":"2013-10-15T11:41:38+00:00","issns":["1872-7123"],"journal":"Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging Section","last_mentioned_on":1385558789,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24120301?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0925492713002692"],"pmid":"24120301","pubdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Schizophrenia thalamus imaging: Low benzamide binding to dopamine D2 receptors suggests fewer D2Short receptors and less presynaptic terminals.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/schizophrenia-thalamus-imaging-low-benzamide-binding-dopamine-d2-receptors-suggests-fewer-d2short-re"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2922474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1435969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101224,"mean":7.7249754897604,"rank":66129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":32394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101224,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250,"mean":2.7266666666667,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.6982142857143,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
