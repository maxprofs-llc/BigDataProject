Despite their advantages, which include greater improvement in negative symptoms, cognitive function, prevention of deterioration, quality of life, and fewer extrapyramidal symptoms, the concern regarding metabolic abnormalities which might cause cardiovascular diseases during treatment with SGAs have been rising. Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is an enzyme mostly located on high-density lipoprotein particles, and has been shown to protect or inhibit lipoprotein oxidation. Growing evidence suggests that PON1 plays a key role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082a9","authors":["Yakup Albayrak","C\u00fcneyt \u00dcnsal","Neslihan Albayrak","Murat Kuloglu","Kenji Hashimoto"],"doi":"10.2147\/ndt.s52463","first_seen_on":"2013-10-15T01:55:55+00:00","issns":["1176-6328"],"journal":"Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1381802147,"links":["http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=14659","http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/reduced-serum-paraoxonase-1-pon1-activity-in-patients-with-schizophren-peer-reviewed-article-NDT"],"pmid":"24143103","pubdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1545","title":"Reduced serum paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity in patients with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine but not quetiapine","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reduced-serum-paraoxonase-1-pon1-activity-patients-schizophrenia-treated-olanzapine-not-quetiapine-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":1988324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101226,"mean":7.7258822030134,"rank":41354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":57100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101226,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":908,"mean":3.2913406835722,"rank":439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":908,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":2.8765862068966,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ThihaSwe_dr\/status\/388493743927885824","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1826040],"posted_on":"2013-10-11T02:38:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Psychiatry Updates","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PsychiatryUpdates.by.DrThihaSwe","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3471096253\/6b7bd3fc313986902cd1574474364bae_normal.jpeg","description":"[RSS Updates from Psychiatry Journals globally, plus some mental health related news] \/ Should follow only if you are interested in Mental Health","id_on_source":"ThihaSwe_dr","tweeter_id":"1259166031","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":974},"tweet_id":"388493743927885824"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psychopharmacol\/status\/389932586035716096","license":"public","citation_ids":[1826040],"posted_on":"2013-10-15T01:55:47+00:00","author":{"name":"PfOL","url":"http:\/\/pfol.byethost32.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/499594941207564290\/vOaCe2P-_normal.jpeg","description":"PfOL offers updated information on psychopharmacology.
