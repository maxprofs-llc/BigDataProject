Urinary GAGs were measured in 47 athletic horses, 20 healthy and 27 with osteoarthritis. The effects of CS and GlcN were investigated in mild osteoarthritis. In comparison to normal, urinary GAGs were increased in osteoarthritis, including mild osteoarthritis affecting only one joint. Treatment with CS+GlcN led to a long lasting increase in the urinary CS and keratan sulfate (KS), and significant improvement in flexion test of tarsocrural and metacarpophalangeal joints was observed. In conclusion, urinary CS and KS seems to reflect the turnover rates of cartilage matrix proteoglycans, and the measurement of these compounds could provide objective means of evaluating and monitoring joint diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f61000346b","authors":["Raquel Y A Baccarin","Tha\u00eds S L Machado","Ana P Lopes-Moraes","Fabiana A C Vieira","Yara M Michelacci","Raquel Y.A.
