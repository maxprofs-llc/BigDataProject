Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) represent the strongest and most reproducible genetic associations with diabetes. We investigated the association of tag SNPs in TCF7L2 with thiazide-induced NOD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f6100084d9","authors":["Karnes, Jason H.","Gong, Yan","Pacanowski, Michael A.","McDonough, Caitrin W.","Arwood, Meghan J.","Langaee, Taimour Y.","Pepine, Carl J.","Johnson, Julie A.","Cooper-DeHoff, Rhonda M."],"doi":"10.1097\/fpc.0000000000000012","first_seen_on":"2013-10-16T03:02:14+00:00","funders":["nigms","nhlbi"],"issns":["1744-6872"],"issue":"12","journal":"Pharmacogenetics and Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1387803706,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jpharmacogenetics\/9000\/00000\/Impact_of_TCF7L2_single_nucleotide_polymorphisms.99495.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jpharmacogenetics\/Abstract\/2013\/12000\/Impact_of_TCF7L2_single_nucleotide_polymorphisms.6.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jpharmacogenetics\/9000\/00000\/Impact_of_TCF7L2_single_nucleotide_polymorphisms.99495.pdf","pmid":"24128935","pubdate":"2013-10-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"","subjects":["geneticsmedical","pharmacology"],"title":"Impact of TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms on hydrochlorothiazide-induced diabetes","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jpharmacogenetics\/Fulltext\/2013\/12000\/Impact_of_TCF7L2_single_nucleotide_polymorphisms.6.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-tcf7l2-single-nucleotide-polymorphisms-hydrochlorothiazideinduced-diabetes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230817,"mean":5.9681223701699,"rank":4607959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230817,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112395,"mean":7.8729783084507,"rank":74821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":20323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112395,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":583,"mean":1.6817972508591,"rank":294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":583,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.3329090909091,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
