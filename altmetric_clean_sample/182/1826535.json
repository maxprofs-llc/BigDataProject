Twelve patients presenting with undisplaced fractures were initially treated nonoperatively; of these, five displaced, requiring fixation. The remaining seven patients, all children, united uneventfully. Sixty-two patients presenting with displaced fractures were treated with internal fixation using a single lag screw through a lateral approach. The patients were treated semi-electively on a day surgery unit. Twenty-seven patients with unicondylar fractures, all operated on within 2 weeks of injury, regained full range of movement. Thirty-eight patients had loss of extension (range 10-35\u00b0) with fixed flexion contractures at the proximal interphalangeal and thumb interphalangeal joints and extensor lag at the distal interphalangeal joints (overall mean extension loss 10\u00b0). Although fixation was technically easier during the first week, a delay of 2 weeks before fixation made little difference to the outcome. In our experience, fractures can be taken down and fixed internally even 8 weeks after injury. If nonoperative treatment is initially embarked upon, close monitoring is required with weekly radiographs up to 3 weeks, as these fractures will frequently displace.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e4f","authors":["D.
