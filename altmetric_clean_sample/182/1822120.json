As the use of hematopoietic transplant has expanded, so too has the source of stem and progenitor cells. The predominate source of stem and progenitors today, particularly in settings of autologous transplantation, is mobilized peripheral blood. This review will highlight the historical advances which led to the widespread use of peripheral blood stem cells for transplantation, with a look toward future enhancements to mobilization strategies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f610008a36","authors":["Hoggatt, Jonathan","Speth, Jennifer M.","Pelus, Louis M."],"doi":"10.1002\/stem.1574","endpage":"2606","first_seen_on":"2013-10-12T19:07:00+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["1549-4918","1066-5099"],"issue":"12","journal":"Stem Cells","last_mentioned_on":1381604740,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/stem.1574\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/stem.1574\/pdf","pmid":"24123398","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2599","subjects":["embryology","cellbiology"],"title":"Sowing the seeds of a fruitful harvest: Hematopoietic stem cell mobilization","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/concise-review-sowing-seeds-fruitful-harvest-hematopoietic-stem-cell-mobilization-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6691269,"mean":6.1588115935552,"rank":5714636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6691269,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137051,"mean":6.9604763954763,"rank":110200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137051,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1636,"mean":5.9985394495413,"rank":1509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1636,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.5625,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
