This conclusion was explicitly confirmed by the structure of the monohydride intermediate intercepted in the low temperature NMR hydrogenation experiments. DFT analysis of the origin of enantioselection showed that it takes place via obstructing the proper coordination of the double bond in the S-enantioselective pathway.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Ilya Gridnev","Christina Kohrt","Yuanyuan Liu","Ilya D.
