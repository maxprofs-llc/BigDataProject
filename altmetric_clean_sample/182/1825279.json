Clinical features include diabetes, hypertension, obesity, skin atrophy, immune suppression and delayed wound healing. We report a patient with iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome, in whom long-term topical steroid therapy was used to treat varicose eczema, which contributed to the development of type 2 diabetes, morbid obesity, sleep apnoea and chronic wound sepsis. In this case, repeated hospital admissions and systemic antibiotics were associated with considerable comorbidity. Aggressive local treatment, consisting of potassium permanganate soaks and irrigating gels, was highly effective in reducing the amount of exudate, pain and preventing from further deterioration of the patient's legs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e83cf058f6100059c4","authors":["Biswas, Moushmi","Gibby, Owain","Ivanova\u2010Stoilova, Tzvetanka","Harding, Keith","Biswas M","Gibby O","Ivanova-Stoilova T","Harding K"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1742-481x.2010.00746.x","endpage":"102","first_seen_on":"2013-10-14T20:47:55+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1742-481X","1742-4801"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Wound Journal","last_mentioned_on":1454746339,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1742-481X.2010.00746.x\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1742-481X.2010.00746.x\/pdf","pmid":"21078130","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"99","title":"Cushing's syndrome and chronic venous ulceration \u2013 a clinical challenge","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cushings-syndrome-chronic-venous-ulceration-clinical-challenge"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7108255,"mean":6.3028542255213,"rank":2834543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4170474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7108255,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138816,"mean":6.9067869610634,"rank":45346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":91291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138816,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":335,"mean":4.2385748502994,"rank":106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":335,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.0416666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"googleplus":[{"title":"Cushing's syndrome and chronic venous ulceration \u2013 a clinical challenge http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com...","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/101068850358271508284\/posts\/Ntb6qDLNciF","citation_ids":[1825279],"posted_on":"2013-10-14T06:48:49+00:00","summary":"Cushing's syndrome and chronic venous ulceration \u2013 a clinical challenge http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com...
