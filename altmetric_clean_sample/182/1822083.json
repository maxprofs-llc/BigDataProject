The Health Education teacher can frequently be at a loss to decipher what theoretical principles could or should permeate sexuality education curricula, which may be both detracting and distracting from the educational process. This paper explores and analyses a suggested selection of sexuality education pedagogies integrating the theoretical framework of Anderson and Krathwohl and Gardner's Inter-personal Intelligence theories. In response to the earlier maturation of girls and boys, and the concomitant need for better and earlier sexuality education, pedagogies relevant for three age groups, elementary\/primary school (7-9 years), middle school (10-12 years) and high school (13-15 years), are identified and analysed as appropriate for these students' cognitive abilities. The integration of these two educational theories has implications for Health Education practitioners, whereby this approach may be useful to assist sexuality educators in identifying and anchoring pedagogies in a more theoretical and structured approach. Providing theoretical starting points, and directions to achieve students' learning goals, may enhance the quality of Health teachers' conceptualizing and planning for implementing quality sexuality education knowledge and skills' teaching and learning.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f61000591d","authors":["Juliette D.
