This review seeks to summarize what is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying Li's actions in the brain in response to stress, particularly how Li is able to facilitate plasticity through regulation of the glutamate system and cytoskeletal components.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002163","authors":["Gray, J.
