PCPE-1 interacts with several proteins in addition to procollagens and BMP-1, suggesting that it could be involved in biological processes other than collagen maturation. We thus searched for additional partners of PCPE-1 in the extracellular matrix, which could provide new insights into its biological roles. We identified 17 new partners of PCPE-1 by SPR (surface plasmon resonance) imaging. PCPE-1 forms a transient complex with the \u03b2-amyloid peptide, whereas it forms high or very high affinity complexes with laminin-111 (KD=58.8 pM), collagen VI (KD=9.5 nM), TSP-1 (thrombospondin-1) (KD1=19.9 pM, KD2=14.5 nM), collagen IV (KD=49.4 nM) and endostatin, a fragment of collagen XVIII (KD1=0.30 nM, KD2=1.1 nM). Endostatin binds to the NTR (netrin-like) domain of PCPE-1 and decreases the degree of superstimulation of PCPE-1 enhancing activity by heparin. The analysis of the PCPE-1 interaction network based on Gene Ontology terms suggests that, besides its role in collagen deposition, PCPE-1 might be involved in tumour growth, neurodegenerative diseases and angiogenesis. In vitro assays have indeed shown that the CUB1CUB2 (where CUB is complement protein subcomponents C1r\/C1s, urchin embryonic growth factor and BMP-1) fragment of PCPE-1 inhibits angiogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c1","authors":["Salza R","Romain Salza","Franck Peysselon","Emilie Chautard","Clement Faye","Laura Moschcovich","Tali Weiss","Laure Perrin-Cocon","Vincent Lotteau","Efrat Kessler","Sylvie Ricard-Blum"],"doi":"10.1042\/bj20130295","first_seen_on":"2013-10-14T14:29:48+00:00","issns":["0264-6021"],"journal":"Biochemical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1387303465,"links":["http:\/\/www.biochemj.org\/bj\/imps\/abs\/BJ20130295.htm","http:\/\/www.biochemj.org\/bj\/457\/bj4570137.htm"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biochemj.org\/bj\/imps\/pdf\/BJ20130295.pdf","pmid":"24117177","publisher":"Portland Press Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Extended interaction network of Procollagen C-Proteinase Enhancer-1 in the extracellular matrix","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extended-interaction-network-procollagen-cproteinase-enhancer1-extracellular-matrix"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2302967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1599479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101027,"mean":7.7620243501675,"rank":50121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":36101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101027,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4115,"mean":2.1625401069519,"rank":2645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4115,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":4.5375,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
