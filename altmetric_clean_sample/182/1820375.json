The aglycon segment, a vineomycinone B2 derivative, and the glycon segment, an \u03b1-L-acurosyl-L-rhodinose derivative, were prepared via C-glycosylation using an unprotected sugar and powerful chemoselective O-glycosylation using a 2,3-unsaturated sugar, respectively, as the key steps. Furthermore, effective and simultaneous introduction of the two glycon moieties to the aglycon part by concentration-controlled glycosylation led to the total synthesis of 1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Shunichi Kusumi","Satoshi Tomono","Shunsuke Okuzawa","Erika Kaneko","Takashi Ueda","Kaname Sasaki","Daisuke Takahashi","Kazunobu Toshima"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja407827n","first_seen_on":"2013-10-11T19:11:54+00:00","issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1381524758,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja407827n"],"pmid":"24074200","pubdate":"2013-10-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"131011102144000","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Total Synthesis of Vineomycin B2.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/total-synthesis-vineomycin-b2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.264,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.264},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6290856,"mean":5.8077092509686,"rank":544028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":5746757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6290856,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110797,"mean":7.9876483808081,"rank":12982,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":97814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110797,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16100,"mean":4.8198618547736,"rank":1486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":14612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16100,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":457,"mean":4.8648903508772,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":457,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
