Our findings of the unprecedentedly fast Li ion transport and reversible formation-decomposition of discharge products attributed to the modified surface arrangement of \u03b1-MnO2 NWs suggest a strategy for achieving high-power Li-air batteries in combination with nano-architecture tailoring.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ee3","authors":["Kyeong-Se Song","Jeapyeong Jung","Yoon Uk Heo","Yoon Cheol Lee","Kyeongjae Cho","Yongmook Kang","Kyeongse Song","Jaepyeong Jung","Yoon-Uk Heo","Yong-Mook Kang"],"doi":"10.1039\/c3cp53754d","first_seen_on":"2013-10-11T17:52:21+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1463-9084","1463-9076"],"issue":"46","journal":"Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics (PCCP)","last_mentioned_on":1381745662,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/CP\/C3CP53754D"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2013\/cp\/c3cp53754d","pmid":"24154608","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"20075","subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"\u00ce\u00b1-MnO2 nanowire catalysts with ultra-high capacity and extremely low overpotential in lithium-air Batteries through tailored surface arrangement","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/%CE%B1mno2-nanowire-catalysts-ultrahigh-capacity-extremely-low-overpotential-lithiumair-batteries-through"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":2310629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1579774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100997,"mean":7.8247280486358,"rank":50647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":34606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100997,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2114,"mean":1.8869597728348,"rank":646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":1081,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2114,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.285,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
