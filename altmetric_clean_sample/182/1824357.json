To determine if the propensity to eat placenta varies with reproductive status in the biparental California mouse, we presented placenta to virgin (housed with a same-sex pairmate), expectant (pregnant with their first litter), and multiparous adult males and females. Liver was presented identically, 3-7 days later, as a control. Multiparous females were more likely to eat placenta than expectant and virgin females (p-values <0.016), whereas both multiparous and expectant males had higher incidences of placentophagia than virgins (p-values <0.016). Liver consumption did not differ among groups within either sex. These results suggest that propensity to eat placenta increases with maternal\/birthing experience in females, and with paternal experience and\/or cohabitation with a pregnant female in males.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f6100070f6","authors":["Juan P Perea-Rodriguez","Wendy Saltzman"],"doi":"10.1002\/dev.21154","first_seen_on":"2013-10-14T12:23:46+00:00","issns":["1098-2302"],"journal":"Developmental Psychobiology","last_mentioned_on":1381753401,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24114333"],"pmid":"24114333","pubdate":"2013-09-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","pediatrics"],"title":"Differences in Placentophagia in Relation to Reproductive Status in the California Mouse (Peromyscus californicus).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differences-placentophagia-relation-reproductive-status-california-mouse-peromyscus-californicus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3562425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101026,"mean":7.7620828705768,"rank":80245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101026,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":366,"mean":3.1513150684932,"rank":275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":366,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.275,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Loose_Lab_Rat\/status\/389728129167949824","license":"public","citation_ids":[1824357],"posted_on":"2013-10-14T12:23:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Kelly A.
