Activation of kainate (KA) and \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptors (GluRs) increase interleukin-6 (IL-6) release and cause arthritic pain, respectively. We hypothesised that AMPA and KA GluRs are expressed in human arthritis, and that intra-articular NBQX (AMPA\/KA GluR antagonist) prevents pain and pathology in antigen-induced arthritis (AIA).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a32","authors":["Cleo S Bonnet","Anwen S Williams","Sophie J Gilbert","Ann K Harvey","Bronwen A Evans","Deborah J Mason"],"doi":"10.1136\/annrheumdis-2013-203670","first_seen_on":"2013-10-15T18:08:17+00:00","funders":["aruk"],"issns":["1468-2060"],"journal":"Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1383677237,"links":["http:\/\/ard.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2013\/10\/15\/annrheumdis-2013-203670.short?rss=1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24130267"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ard.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2013\/10\/15\/annrheumdis-2013-203670.full.pdf","pmid":"24130267","pubdate":"2013-10-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and European League Against Rheumatism","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"annrheumdis-2013-203670","subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"AMPA\/kainate glutamate receptors contribute to inflammation, degeneration and pain related behaviour in inflammatory stages of arthritis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ampakainate-glutamate-receptors-contribute-inflammation-degeneration-pain-related-behaviour-inflamma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2305094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1593511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101224,"mean":7.7251444236984,"rank":50508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":35260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101224,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2290,"mean":5.3255797291394,"rank":1422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2290,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":10.901925,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
