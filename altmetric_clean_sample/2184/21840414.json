Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) treat inborn coagulation disorders and reverse oral anticoagulants, but are proposed for use in \"factor-based\" resuscitation strategies. Few studies exist for this indication in acidosis, or that compare 3-factor (3PCC) versus 4-factor (4PCC) products. We aimed to assess and compare their safety and efficacy in a porcine model of severe hemorrhagic shock and coagulopathy.\nTwenty-five adult Yorkshire swine underwent 35% volume hemorrhage, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and protocolized crystalloid resuscitation. Seventeen animals were randomized at 4 hours following model creation to receive a 45-IU\/kg dose of either 3PCC or 4PCC. An additional 8 animals received autologous plasma transfusion prior to 4PCC to better characterize response to PCC. Individual factor levels were drawn at 4 and 6 hours.\nThe model created significant acidosis with mean pH 7.21 and lactate of 9.6 mmol\/L. Following PCC, 66.7% of 3PCC animals and 25% of 4PCC animals (regardless of plasma administration) developed consumptive coagulopathy. The animals that developed consumptive coagulopathy had manifested the \"lethal triad\" with lower temperatures (36.3 vs. 37.8\u00b0C), increased acidosis (pH 7.14 vs. 7.27, base excess -12.1 vs. -6.5 mEq\/L), and worse coagulopathy (prothrombin time 17.1 vs. 14.6 seconds, fibrinogen 87.9 vs. 124.1 mg\/dL) (all p<0.05). In the absence of a consumptive coagulopathy, 3PCC and 4PCC improved individual clotting factors with transient improvement of prothrombin time, but there was significant depletion of fibrinogen and platelets with no lasting improvement of coagulopathy.\nPCC failed to correct coagulopathy and was associated with fibrinogen and platelet depletion. Of greater concern, PCC administration resulted in consumptive coagulopathy in the more severely ill animals. The incidence of consumptive coagulopathy was markedly increased with 3PCC versus 4PCC, and these products should be used with caution in this setting.\nII, therapeutic.","altmetric_jid":"5523eeb22a83ee005f8b4573","authors":["Moe, Donald Michael","Lallemand, Michael Scott","McClellan, John Mason","Smith, Joshua Porter","Marko, Shannon T.","Eckert, Matthew J.","Martin, Matthew J."],"doi":"10.1097\/ta.0000000000001646","first_seen_on":"2017-07-13T10:06:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2163-0755","2163-0763"],"journal":"Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, The","last_mentioned_on":1499940377,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28700408?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28700408","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health)","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Three versus four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates for \u201cfactor-based\u201d resuscitation in a porcine hemorrhagic shock model","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/three-versus-fourfactor-prothrombin-complex-concentrates-factorbased-resuscitation-porcine-hemorrhag"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204513,"mean":6.9458687178401,"rank":7099887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204513,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179354,"mean":11.445204150474,"rank":146298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179354,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2607,"mean":6.5995863392172,"rank":2273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2607,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":5.3793181818182,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TraumaMankin\/statuses\/885440235579949056","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21840414],"posted_on":"2017-07-13T10:06:17+00:00","author":{"name":"James Mankin","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"TraumaMankin","tweeter_id":"3194362700","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":8},"tweet_id":"885440235579949056"}]}}
