The present study aimed to explore the cisternal segment of the AChA using magnetic resonance imaging.\nA total of 50 sides of the AChA obtained from 25 patients were included in this study. A constructive interference in steady-state (CISS) sequence was performed in thin-sliced axial sections. Furthermore, the cisternal AChA and relevant neurovascular structures were observed through cadaveric dissections in two heads.\nIn the cadaveric dissections, all the AChAs were exposed only in the proximal part even after extensive arachnoid dissections and cerebral retraction. In the examinations with the CISS sequence, the original site of the AChA was identified on the right side in 88% and on the left side in 96%. In 70% of the 50 sides, the AChA arose from the posterolateral wall of the internal carotid artery, distally to that of the posterior communicating artery. The cisternal course of the AChA was delineated on the right side in 96% and on the left side in 100%; it crossed over the optic tract in variable manners with the middle third as the most frequent site found in 60% of the sides.\nThe cisternal AChA shows a morphological variability. The CISS sequence is useful for delineating the cisternal AChA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002511","authors":["Tsutsumi, Satoshi","Ono, Hideo","Yasumoto, Yukimasa"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00381-017-3525-8","first_seen_on":"2017-07-13T14:04:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0256-7040","1433-0350"],"journal":"Child's Nervous System","last_mentioned_on":1500053590,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28698909?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28698909","pubdate":"2017-07-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology","pediatrics"],"title":"The cisternal segment of the anterior choroidal artery: an anatomical study using magnetic resonance imaging","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":1.1,"6m":1.1,"3m":1.1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8208212,"mean":6.9507561304097,"rank":4333519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3846715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8208212,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180351,"mean":11.458240133075,"rank":97318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":81695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180351,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1005,"mean":1.9084262948207,"rank":303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1005,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":0.93382352941176,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PedNeurBriefs\/statuses\/885496046738055172","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21849641],"posted_on":"2017-07-13T13:48:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Ped Neurology Briefs","url":"http:\/\/www.pediatricneurologybriefs.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/763925960097800192\/QpZJcQcD_normal.jpg","description":"Pediatric Neurology Briefs (PNB) is the leading journal review focusing on child neurology since 1987. #OpenAccess on #PubMed & #PubMedCentral.","id_on_source":"PedNeurBriefs","tweeter_id":"759957720","geo":{"lt":41.85003,"ln":-87.65005,"country":"US"},"followers":2023},"tweet_id":"885496046738055172"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Aravind8\/statuses\/885915086979686400","license":"gnip","rt":["PedNeurBriefs"],"citation_ids":[21849641],"posted_on":"2017-07-14T17:33:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Aravind Sai","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/623377040335437824\/11KuW8l2_normal.jpg","description":"General Surgeon,Nationalist,Sickulars stayaway,Janani Janma Bhoomischa,Swargadapi gariyasi .Meru,Dakshinadighbhage ,Srisaila Esanya pradeshe,krishna nadi Sameep","id_on_source":"Aravind8","tweeter_id":"103348134","geo":{"lt":20,"ln":77,"country":"IN"},"followers":780},"tweet_id":"885915086979686400"}]}}
