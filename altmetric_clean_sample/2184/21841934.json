We had previously hypothesized that the morphological, biological and clinical differences between these carcinomas are due to histotype-specific mutations. Although some mutations and genomic landscape features are more likely to be found in one of these histotypes, we were not able to identify a single class of mutations that was exclusively present in one histotype and not the other. This lack of genomic differences led us to an alternative hypothesis that these cancers could arise from distinct cells of origin within endometrial tissue, and it is the cellular context that accounts for their differences. In a proteomic screen, we have identified CTH as a marker for clear cell carcinoma, as it is expressed at high levels in clear cell carcinomas of the ovary and endometrium. In the current study, we analyze normal M\u00fcllerian tissues and find that cystathionine gamma lyase (CTH) is expressed in ciliated cells of endometrium (both eutopic endometrium and endometriosis) and fallopian tube. We then demonstrate that other ciliated cell markers are expressed in clear cell carcinomas whereas endometrial secretory cell markers are expressed in endometrioid carcinomas. The same differential staining of secretory and ciliated cells was demonstrable in a 3D organoid culture system, in which stem cells are stimulated to differentiate into an admixture of secretory and ciliated cells. These data suggest that endometrioid carcinomas are derived from cells of secretory cell lineage whereas clear cell carcinomas are derived from, or have similarities to, cells of ciliated cell lineage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dc7","authors":["Cochrane, Dawn R","Tessier\u2010Cloutier, Basile","Lawrence, Katherine M","Nazeran, Tayyebeh","Karnezis, Anthony N.","Salamanca, Clara","Cheng, Angela S.","McAlpine, Jessica N","Hoang, Lien N","Gilks, C Blake","Huntsman, David G"],"doi":"10.1002\/path.4934","first_seen_on":"2017-07-13T11:20:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-3417","1096-9896"],"journal":"The Journal of Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1500310878,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/path.4934\/full","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/path.4934\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/path.4934\/pdf","pmid":"28678427","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Clear Cell and Endometrioid Carcinomas: are their differences attributable to distinct cells of origin?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clear-cell-endometrioid-carcinomas-differences-attributable-distinct-cells-origin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223669,"mean":6.9683210333815,"rank":3889635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4151320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223669,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188393,"mean":11.543825119963,"rank":85963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":96694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188393,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1189,"mean":3.5190606060606,"rank":658,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1189,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.1307692307692,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CO":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jaimearturomc\/statuses\/885458962765799424","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21841934],"posted_on":"2017-07-13T11:20:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Dyslexior","url":"http:\/\/www.mjnco.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2634204328\/e5dadf2c168e5a0cb5d3643ec81a9a62_normal.jpeg","description":"MD Dyslexic Sesquipedalian Pathologist.","id_on_source":"jaimearturomc","tweeter_id":"37845266","geo":{"lt":3.43722,"ln":-76.5225,"country":"CO"},"followers":484},"tweet_id":"885458962765799424"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ScienceVancity\/statuses\/886994230878621696","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21841934],"posted_on":"2017-07-17T17:01:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Science in the City","url":"http:\/\/www.scienceinthecity.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/834883505314156544\/ZJrAAuh1_normal.jpg","description":"Your complete source for all the life science news, events, and jobs in Vancouver!","id_on_source":"ScienceVancity","tweeter_id":"4261695254","geo":{"lt":49.24966,"ln":-123.11934,"country":"CA"},"followers":230},"tweet_id":"886994230878621696"}]}}
