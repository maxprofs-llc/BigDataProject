Very interesting!"],"citation":{"abstract":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a strongly conserved DNA virus, of which high-risk types can cause cervical cancer in persistent infections. The most common type found in HPV-attributable cancer is HPV16, which can be subdivided into four lineages (A-D) with different carcinogenic properties. Studies have shown HPV16 sequence diversity in different geographical areas, but only limited information is available regarding HPV16 diversity within a population, especially at the whole genome level. We have analyzed HPV16 major variant diversity, conservation in persistent infections and performed a SNP comparison between persistent and clearing infections. Materials were obtained in the Netherlands from a cohort study with longitudinal follow-up for up to three years. Our analysis shows a remarkably large variant diversity in the population. Whole genome sequences were obtained for 57 persistent and 59 clearing HPV16 infections, resulting in 109 unique variants. Interestingly, persistent infections were completely conserved through time. One reinfection event was identified, where the initial and follow-up sample clustered differently. Non-A1\/A2 variants seemed to clear preferentially (p=0.02). Our analysis shows population-wide HPV16 sequence diversity is very large. In persisting infections the HPV16 sequence is fully conserved. Sequencing can identify HPV16 reinfections, although occurrence is rare. SNP comparison identified no strong acting effect of the viral genome affecting HPV16 infection clearance or persistence in up to three years of follow-up. These findings suggest progression of an early HPV16 infection could be host-related.IMPORTANCE Human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 is the predominant type found in cervical cancer. Progression of initial infection to cervical cancer has been linked to sequence properties; however, knowledge on variants circulating in European populations is limited, especially with longitudinal follow-up. By sequencing a number of infections with known follow-up for up to three years, we gain initial insights in the genetic diversity of HPV16 and effects of the viral genome on the persistence of infections. A SNP comparison between sequences obtained from clearing and persisting infections did not identify strong-acting DNA variations responsible for these infection outcomes. In addition, we have identified a HPV16 reinfection event, where sequencing of initial and follow-up samples showed different HPV16 variants. Based on conventional genotyping, this infection would incorrectly be considered a persistent HPV16 infection. In the context of vaccine efficacy and monitoring studies, such infections could potentially cause reduced reported efficacy or efficiency.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Pascal van der Weele","Chris J.
