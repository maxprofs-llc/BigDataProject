In this study the authors assessed whether DM2 and DM2 associated factors were associated with a higher risk of developing GBM and also determined if DM2 impacted the survival of GBM patients.\nA cross sectional case-control study of 1144 GBM cases diagnosed between 2000-2013 of which 969 patients matched for age and sex was done to assess the association between DM2, hyperlipidemia and obesity to the incidence of GBM. A longitudinal study in the GBM patients was also done to assess the association between the effect of DM2 on GBM survival.\nNo association was seen between DM2, hyperlipidemia, obesity and GBM. DM2 was associated with poorer survival in univariate testing yet not in multivariate testing. Diabetic GBM patients had good glycemic control. Lastly, older patients had poorer survival and overall survival improved over years of study.\nDM2, hyperlipidemia and obesity were not associated with increased risk of developing GBM and DM2 itself does not seem to influence survival amongst these patients. This might be related to good glycemic control in this cohort. Survey of the literature consistently shows that hyperglycemia is associated with poorer survival. Our findings suggest that rather than the presence or absence of DM2, glycemic control appears to be more important in the survival of GBM patients warranting future investigation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d13","authors":["Barami, Kaveh","Lyon, Liisa","Conell, Carol"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.wneu.2017.06.164","first_seen_on":"2017-07-13T10:32:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1878-8750","1878-8769"],"journal":"World Neurosurgery","last_mentioned_on":1499941926,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28698089?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28698089","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus and glioblastoma multiforme: assessing risk and survival: results of a large retrospective study and systematic review of the literature","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/type-2-diabetes-mellitus-glioblastoma-multiformeassessing-risk-survival-results-large-retrospective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204513,"mean":6.9458687178401,"rank":7099885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204513,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179354,"mean":11.445207495832,"rank":146297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179354,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":987,"mean":3.1249878296146,"rank":727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":987,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":1.4918421052632,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
