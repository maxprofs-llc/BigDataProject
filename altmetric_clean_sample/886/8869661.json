Sensing the host is a key aspect of pathogen proliferation during disease, and signal transduction pathways are critically important for detecting environmental conditions and facilitating adaptation. This review focuses on the contributions of the cAMP\/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway in Cryptococcus neoformans, a species that causes meningitis in humans, and Ustilago maydis, a model phytopathogen that causes a smut disease on maize. Environmental sensing by the cAMP\/PKA pathway regulates the production of key virulence traits in C. neoformans including the polysaccharide capsule and melanin. For U. maydis, the pathway controls the dimorphic transition from budding growth to the filamentous cell type required for proliferation in plant tissue. We discuss recent advances in identifying new components of the cAMP\/PKA pathway in these pathogens and highlight an emerging theme that pathway signaling influences iron acquisition.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008b26","authors":["Choi, Jaehyuk","Jung, Won Hee","Kronstad, James W"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12275-015-5247-5","endpage":"587","first_seen_on":"2016-06-18T20:18:29+00:00","funders":["niaid","cihr"],"issns":["1976-3794","1225-8873"],"issue":"9","journal":"The Journal of Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1466281091,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26231374?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26231374","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"579","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"The cAMP\/protein kinase A signaling pathway in pathogenic basidiomycete fungi: Connections with iron homeostasis","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/campprotein-kinase-signaling-pathway-pathogenic-basidiomycete-fungi-connections-iron-homeostasis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7912542,"mean":6.6949158185663,"rank":6850387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7912542,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263161,"mean":11.527178780969,"rank":220197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263161,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":295,"mean":1.6495714285714,"rank":229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":295,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.5691666666667,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
