Dental floss clip traction (DFC), a new traction method, is proposed to reduce the difficulty of ESD. The objective of this pilot study was to investigate the efficacy of DFC for gastric ESD.\nFrom August to November 2014, a total of 95 patients with 104 gastric epithelial neoplasms underwent DFC-ESD (DFC group). Historical controls treated by conventional ESD (control group) were individually matched to cases at a 1:1 ratio by lesion location, ulcer findings, resected specimen size, and the proficiency of the operator (trainee\/expert). The outcomes of the procedure in the two groups were then compared.\nThe mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD procedure time was 43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024\u00a0min in the DFC group and 52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030\u00a0min in the control group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Fewer lesions in the DFC group needed >80\u00a0min compared with the control group (3-vs-16 cases, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). There were no significant differences in adverse events between the groups. Perforation and delayed bleeding occurred in one and four lesions, respectively, in the DFC group, and three and nine in the control group. En bloc resection was achieved in all cases. No significant differences were found regarding curability of ESD between the groups.\nDFC effectively reduced ESD procedure time without increasing adverse events. DFC is helpful for rapid, safe ESD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035f7","authors":["Masao Yoshida","Kohei Takizawa","Hiroyuki Ono","Kimihiro Igarashi","Shinya Sugimoto","Noboru Kawata","Masaki Tanaka","Naomi Kakushima","Sayo Ito","Kenichiro Imai","Kinichi Hotta","Hiroyuki Matsubayashi"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00464-015-4580-4","endpage":"3106","first_seen_on":"2016-06-18T15:43:35+00:00","issns":["1432-2218"],"issue":"7","journal":"Surgical Endoscopy","last_mentioned_on":1466295414,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00464-015-4580-4","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s00464-015-4580-4"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00464-015-4580-4.pdf","pmid":"26487208","pubdate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Abdominal Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gynecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hepatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proctology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"3100","subjects":["generalsurgery","diagnosticimaging","gastroenterology"],"title":"Efficacy of endoscopic submucosal dissection with dental floss clip traction for gastric epithelial neoplasia: a pilot study (with video)","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-endoscopic-submucosal-dissection-dental-floss-clip-traction-gastric-epithelial-neoplasia-pi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7917108,"mean":6.6979661075636,"rank":6003527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1062681,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7917108,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263226,"mean":11.528032831228,"rank":184353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263226,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3173,"mean":2.6215687263556,"rank":2123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":738,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3173,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":2.4678125,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Other":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SurgEndosc\/statuses\/744193783852576768","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8865805],"posted_on":"2016-06-18T15:43:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Surgical Endoscopy","url":"http:\/\/www.springer.com\/medicine\/surgery\/journal\/464","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000013288750\/ca66ce36b5667e0eed3bf3c7d2ab6903_normal.jpeg","description":"Official Journal of SAGES and EAES.
