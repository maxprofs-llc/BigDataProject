The overall survival (OS) of patients was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and statistical significance was assessed using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses of Cox proportional hazards regression were used to evaluate the prognostic impact for survival in relapsed or refractory mCRC patients.\nOf the patients, 62.5% had liver metastases, 74.1% underwent greater than second-line chemotherapy, and 80.8% underwent surgery. Median OS was 7.6 months for all patients after the initiation of KM treatment, which was begun 13.7 months, on average, after mCRC diagnosis. Concerning prognostic factors such as the presence of liver metastasis (p = 0.024), high carcinoembryonic antigen level (CEA > 5 ng\/mL, p = 0.044), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP \u2265 10.0 mg\/L, p = 0.000), high absolute monocyte count (AMC > 413.3 cells\/\u03bcL, p = 0.034), elevated serum ferritin (ferritin \u2265 150 ng\/mL, p = 0.002), low hemoglobin level (Hb < 12 g\/dL, p = 0.026) and low albumin (albumin < 3.5 g\/dL, p = 0.003) were associated with increased hazard ratios and poor survival. According to the multivariate proportional hazards model with backward and forward manners, albumin (albumin < 3.5 g\/dL; hazard ratio (HR) 2.218, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.135 - 3.990, p = 0.019), CRP (CRP \u2265 10.0 mg\/L; HR 2.506, 95% CI 1.644 - 3.822, p = 0.000), CEA (CEA > 5 ng\/mL; HR 2.040, 95% CI 1.203 - 3.460, p = 0.008), and serum ferritin (ferritin \u2265 150 ng\/mL; HR 1.763, 95% CI 1.169 - 2.660, p = 0.007) were independent prognostic biomarkers of survival in mCRC patients.\nThese results indicate that serum ferritin acts as an independent prognostic biomarker for survival in relapsed or refractory mCRC patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc3c","authors":["Lee, Sookyung","Song, Anna","Eo, Wankyu"],"doi":"10.7150\/jca.14797","endpage":"964","first_seen_on":"2016-06-18T13:28:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1837-9664"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1466251995,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27313786?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4910588","pmid":"27313786","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"957","title":"Serum Ferritin as a Prognostic Biomarker for Survival in Relapsed or Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serum-ferritin-prognostic-biomarker-survival-relapsed-refractory-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7912542,"mean":6.6949158185663,"rank":6850406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7912542,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263161,"mean":11.527280240158,"rank":220205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263161,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238,"mean":1.9505400843882,"rank":164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":2.2,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
