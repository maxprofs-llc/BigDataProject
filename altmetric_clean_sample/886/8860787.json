The pooled odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI (Confidence interval) were used to judge the value of biomarkers.\nA total of 28 studies were included in this meta-analysis, comprising a total of 3573 patients. MALAT-1 was significantly linked with over survival (OS) (HR=1.58, 95%CI: 1.12-2.23), recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR=2.32, 95% CI: 1.68-3.19) and death-free survival (DFS) (HR=3.28, 95% CI: 1.52-7.09). We found that MALAT-1 was a risk factor in the prognoses of lung cancer (HR=1.54, 95%CI: 1.01-2.34), digestive system cancer (HR=2.16, 95% CI: 1.34-3.48) and ovarian cancer (HR=3.98, 95% CI: 1.54-10.25). In contrast, MALAT-1 was a safe factor in the prognosis of B cell lineage cancer (HR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.33-0.61). MALAT-1 was also a risk factor of RFS in breast cancer (HR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.25-3.09) and the TNM stage in pancreatic cancer (OR=3.65, 95% CI: 1.86-7.18) and glioma (OR=4.30, 95% CI: 1.90-9.73) and was a safe factor in colorectal cancer (OR=0.17, 95% CI: 0.08-0.35). MALAT-1 was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis in clear cell carcinoma (OR=5.04, 95% CI: 2.36-10.78) and distant metastasis in pancreatic cancer (OR=11.64, 95% CI: 2.13-63.78).\nMALAT-1 can serve as a molecular marker in different types of cancers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc3c","authors":["Wang, Yumin","Xue, Dan","Li, Yuwei","Pan, Xuya","Zhang, Xueying","Kuang, Biao","Zhou, Ming","Li, Xiaoling","Xiong, Wei","Li, Guiyuan","Zeng, Zhaoyang","Yang, Tubao"],"doi":"10.7150\/jca.14663","endpage":"1001","first_seen_on":"2016-06-18T12:05:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1837-9664"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1466258170,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27313790?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4910592","pmid":"27313790","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"991","title":"The Long Noncoding RNA MALAT-1 is A Novel Biomarker in Various Cancers: A Meta-analysis Based on the GEO Database and Literature","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/long-noncoding-rna-malat1-novel-biomarker-various-cancers-metaanalysis-based-geo-database-literature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7912542,"mean":6.6949158185663,"rank":5717769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1912306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7912542,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263161,"mean":11.52723369053,"rank":169152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":78839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263161,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238,"mean":1.9505400843882,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":2.2,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
