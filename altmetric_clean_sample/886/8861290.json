ARPE-19 is an RPE cell line established as an in vitro model for the study of AMD pathogenesis. Oxidative stress is an AMD pathogenesis factor that induces DNA damage. Thus, the oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) of ARPE-19 cells can be important in AMD pathogenesis. The metabolism of retinoids-which regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and the visual cycle in the retina-was reported to be disturbed in AMD patients. In the present work, we studied the effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, a retinoid) on DDR in ARPE-19 cells subjected to oxidative stress. We observed that ATRA increased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alkali-labile sites in DNA, DNA single-strand breaks, and cell death evoked by oxidative stress. ATRA did not modulate DNA repair or the distribution of cells in cell cycle in the response of ARPE-19 cells to oxidative stress. ATRA induced autophagy in the absence of oxidative stress, but had no effect on this process in the stress. ATRA induced over-expression of proliferation marker MKI67 and neovascularization marker VEGF-A. In conclusion, ATRA increased oxidative stress in ARPE-19 cells, resulting in more lesions to their DNA and cell death. Moreover, ATRA can modulate some properties of these cells, including neovascularization, which is associated with the exudative form of AMD. Therefore, ATRA can be important in the prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of AMD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Tokarz, Paulina","Piastowska-Ciesielska, Agnieszka Wanda","Kaarniranta, Kai","Blasiak, Janusz","Paulina Tokarz"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms17060898","first_seen_on":"2016-06-18T12:12:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"6","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1483118960,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27314326?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27314326?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/17\/6\/898\/htm?utm_source=LinkedIn&utm_medium=YouTube&utm_campaign=Daisy%20%26%20Magda%20Video%20Testimonial%20SensiFAST"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/17\/6\/898\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4926432","pmid":"27314326","pubdate":"2016-06-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"898","title":"All-Trans Retinoic Acid Modulates DNA Damage Response and the Expression of the VEGF-A and MKI67 Genes in ARPE-19 Cells Subjected to Oxidative Stress","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alltrans-retinoic-acid-modulates-dna-damage-response-expression-vegfa-mki67-genes-arpe19-cells-subje"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":2.95,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7958342,"mean":6.7226589717569,"rank":1855552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6093076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7958342,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263656,"mean":11.530722322732,"rank":78623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":184422,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263656,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5010,"mean":2.2800618886005,"rank":576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":4423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5010,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":377,"mean":1.9403617021277,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":377,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
