A single 8-mm diameter filter paper disc containing about 13 microL blood was used. IGFBP-3 was efficiently extracted in a buffer within 1 h of incubation. IGF-I extraction involved incubation in buffer followed by acidification and neutralization steps. Blood spot assays showed intra- and interassay coefficients of variation (including interspot variations) of 5.4-16.7% for IGF-I and 6.6-11.7% for IGFBP-3; recoveries were 97 +\/- 7.1% and 101 +\/- 8.7%, respectively. Recoveries of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in response to 4- to 8-fold variations in extraction buffer volume were 97 +\/- 8.2% and 107 +\/- 6.1%, respectively. Dried blood spot IGF-I and IGFBP-3 showed greater than 1-month stability at -20 C, 4 C, and room temperature and retained more than 65% of the immunoreactivity after approximately 1 month at 37 C. Both IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were contained within the plasma fraction of whole blood, and variations (mean +\/- SD) in IGF-I (204 +\/- 29 micrograms\/L) and IGFBP-3 (4.4 +\/- 0.48 mg\/L) measured in extracts of dried blood spot with adjusted hematocrit of 0.2-0.62 were acceptable. IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in paired plasma and dried blood spot extracts of random samples (n = 46) showed excellent correlation (r > 0.94) with slopes of near unity. Compared to conventional methods, the filter paper procedures were equally effective in distinguishing IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels in untreated GH receptor-deficient (n = 11) and age-matched normal controls (n = 16). We conclude that blood collected on filter paper is ideal for IGF-I and IGFBP-3 analysis and may find applications in pediatric and large scale infant screening programs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be1","authors":["Diamandi, A","Khosravi, M J","Mistry, J","Martinez, V","Guevara-Aguirre, J"],"doi":"10.1210\/jcem.83.7.4923","endpage":"2301","first_seen_on":"2016-06-18T18:06:28+00:00","issns":["0021-972X","1945-7197"],"issue":"7","journal":"The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1360079640,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9661598"],"pmid":"9661598","pubdate":"1998-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2296","subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Filter Paper Blood Spot Assay of Human Insulin-Like Growth Factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-Binding Protein-3 and Preliminary Application in the Evaluation of Growth Hormone Status","type":"article","volume":"83","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/filter-paper-blood-spot-assay-human-insulinlike-growth-factor-i-igfi-igfbinding-protein3-preliminary-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.44,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.44},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5248254,"mean":6.1854664479802,"rank":918040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":4329876,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5248254,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92999,"mean":10.589927869417,"rank":18317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":74681,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92999,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5387,"mean":6.5026086149276,"rank":931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":4456,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5387,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":22.128103448276,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Insulin-like growth factor and autism","url":"http:\/\/questioning-answers.blogspot.com\/2016\/06\/a-study-to-watch-probiotics-for-autism.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[1211544,3250594,1895449,1211057,8867789,8867790,8867792,3145222,8867794,8867797,1218834,8324582,385215,8867802,8867804,8867805,1211544,5298145,8476773,6218824,3887829,8796674,8476773],"posted_on":"2013-02-05T15:54:00+00:00","summary":"I admit to being a tiny bit sceptical\/skeptical whenever I read a press release about hypothesis-only papers.
