Furthermore, several exciting novel therapeutic approaches specifically focused on HIV clearance from non-CD4 T-cell populations are being developed.\nAlthough reservoir validity in these non-CD4 T cells continues to remain debated, this review will highlight recent advances and make an argument as to their clinical relevancy as we progress towards an HIV cure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007070","authors":["Sacha, Jonah B.","Ndhlovu, Lishomwa C."],"doi":"10.1097\/coh.0000000000000283","endpage":"382","first_seen_on":"2016-06-18T20:31:31+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["1746-6318","1746-630X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Current Opinion in HIV & AIDS","last_mentioned_on":1466281870,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-hivandaids\/Fulltext\/2016\/07000\/Strategies_to_target_non_T_cell_HIV_reservoirs.5.aspx?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/co-hivandaids\/2016\/07000\/Strategies_to_target_non_T_cell_HIV_reservoirs.5.pdf","pmid":"27023285","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"376","subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Strategies to target non-T-cell HIV reservoirs","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-hivandaids\/Fulltext\/2016\/07000\/Strategies_to_target_non_T_cell_HIV_reservoirs.5.aspx","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/strategies-target-nontcell-hiv-reservoirs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7912542,"mean":6.6949158185663,"rank":6000133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1062082,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7912542,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263160,"mean":11.527214984097,"rank":184310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42964,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263160,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":385,"mean":2.7199114583333,"rank":244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":385,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":3.809375,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
