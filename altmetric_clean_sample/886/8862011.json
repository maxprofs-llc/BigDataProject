To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with high levels of CYFRA21-1 to date. We herein report a case of a 79-year-old man with a large subcutaneous tumor of the left shoulder, which was diagnosed as primary cutaneous poorly differentiated SCC. The tumor nests were composed of poorly differentiated atypical squamous cells exhibiting high-grade malignancy and mitotic figures; multinuclear cells were also identified inside lymph vessels. Keratin 19 (K19) was intensely expressed in tumor cells. A significantly elevated level of CYFRA21-1 (33 ng\/ml) was observed preoperatively. After surgery, the level of CYFRA21-1 was significantly decreased (from 33 to 5.0 ng\/ml). Our case demonstrated that K19-positive primary cutaneous undifferentiated SCC induced high levels of CYFRA21-1 in the serum. Thus, CYFRA 21-1 may be a marker indicative of poorly differentiated cutaneous SCC exhibiting K19 expression.","authors":["Ueda, Misato","Yasuda, Michinori","Shibaoka, Yoshie","Kurokawa, Ichiro","Kakuno, Ayako","Tsubura, Airo"],"doi":"10.3892\/mco.2016.834","first_seen_on":"2016-06-18T12:23:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2049-9450","2049-9469"],"issue":"6","journal":"Molecular and clinical oncology","last_mentioned_on":1466245572,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27313859?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4888029","pmid":"27313859","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Keratin 19\u2011positive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma with elevated serum cytokeratin 19 fragment 21-1 level: A case report","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/keratin-19positive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma-elevated-serum-cytokeratin-19-fragment-211-leve"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dermatologyf\/statuses\/744113980566736896","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8862011],"posted_on":"2016-06-18T10:26:12+00:00","author":{"name":"dermatologyf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2046835740\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Dermatology News","id_on_source":"dermatologyf","tweeter_id":"546505902","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":58},"tweet_id":"744113980566736896"}]}}
