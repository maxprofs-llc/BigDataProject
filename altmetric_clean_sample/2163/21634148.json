No patient had any clinically apparent heart disease. Analyses of ST-segment depressions > or = 0.1 mV from 24 h ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings revealed horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depressions in seven of the patients. The serum concentration of creatine kinase (CKMB) the day after admission correlated with the urinary excretion of adrenaline (r = 0.74, P < 0.001) and noradrenaline (r = 0.71, P < 0.001). In the two patients with the highest adrenaline excretion and the highest serum concentrations of CKMB and cardiac troponin T, horizontal ST-segment depressions were detected as well. The left ventricular ejection fraction was > or = 0.65 (range 0.65-0.79) in all of the 17 alcoholic men who were examined by echocardiography. Our study shows that alcohol withdrawal is frequently associated with ST-segment abnormalities in men without impairment of heart function and that sympatho-adrenergic activation during withdrawal seems to influence the release of myocardial enzymes. Alcohol withdrawal should thus be considered a condition in which acute cardiac complications may be expected in susceptible individuals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021c6","authors":["HANS DENISON","SVERKER JERN","RUDOLF JAGENBURG","CHRISTER WENDESTAM","SVEN WALLERSTEDT"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-08T04:17:06+00:00","issns":["0735-0414","1464-3502"],"issue":"2","journal":"Alcohol & Alcoholism","last_mentioned_on":1388473200,"links":["http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/32\/2\/185.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/32\/2\/185.full.pdf","pmid":"9105513","pubdate":"1997-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"ST-segment changes and catecholamine-related myocardial enzyme release during alcohol withdrawal.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stsegment-changes-catecholaminerelated-myocardial-enzyme-release-during-alcohol-withdrawal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8021290,"mean":6.7878544007037,"rank":1542700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6444670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8021290,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104545,"mean":10.738960208142,"rank":24406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":79987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104545,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1091,"mean":6.6234036697248,"rank":299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1091,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.73125,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
