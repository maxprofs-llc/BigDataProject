Apneas, hypopneas, and snoring were eliminated by CPAP in OSA subjects, but there was no significant change in MSLT scores. Periodic limb movements were eliminated with pramipexole. One of 3 narcolepsy subjects and 1 of 2 PTH subjects had resolution of hypersomnia with modafinil. There was no significant change in FOSQ, POMS, or PVT results after treatment.\nTreatment of sleep disorders after TBI may result in polysomnographic resolution without change in sleepiness or neuropsychological function.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bf1","authors":["Richard J.
