In the present study, the fliA gene was cloned and sequenced. The fliA coding region consisted of 717 nucleotides beginning with the GTG initiation codon and the conserved sequence specific to promoters for flagellar operons was found to exist upstream of the coding region. The fliA gene product deduced from the nucleotide sequence was a protein with 239 amino acid residues and the calculated molecular mass was 27,470 dalton. The deduced amino acid sequence was homologous with that of sigma 28, a flagellar specific sigma factor of Bacillus subtilis. The fliA gene product was identified as a protein of molecular mass 29 kDa in the in vitro transcription-translation system, while three proteins of 29 kDa, 31 kDa and 32 kDa were found in the products programmed by the fliA gene in minicells and in maxicells. The 29 kDa FliA protein was purified from the FliA overproducing strain which carried the ptac-fliA fusion. This protein activated the in vitro synthesis of flagellin, the fliC gene product. RNA polymerase containing the purified FliA protein was shown to transcribe the fliC gene. These results indicate that FliA protein functions as an alternative sigma factor specific for S. typhimurium flagellar operons.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081db","authors":["Ohnishi, K","Kutsukake, K","Suzuki, H","Iino, T"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-08T06:03:20+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0026-8925"],"issue":"2","journal":"Molecular and General Genetics MGG","last_mentioned_on":1362749968,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2196428"],"pmid":"2196428","pubdate":"1990-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["molecularbiology","genetics"],"title":"Gene fliA encodes an alternative sigma factor specific for flagellar operons in Salmonella typhimurium.","type":"article","volume":"221","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gene-flia-encodes-alternative-sigma-factor-specific-flagellar-operons-salmonella-typhimurium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8021884,"mean":6.7888390820419,"rank":896561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7080767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8021884,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104689,"mean":10.744505731316,"rank":16469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":88030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104689,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210,"mean":3.1365645933014,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
