By using a multi-stage cluster sampling method, they were selected from rural and urban areas of 30 provinces of Iran. ST and PA were assessed by self-administered validated questionnaires. Height, weight, hip and waist circumferences (WC) were measured according to standard protocols, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. ST of <2 h per day was categorized as \"low\" and \u22652 h per day as \"high\". PA levels were obtained by a 7-day recall of sports or activities that made participants sweat or make their legs feel tired, or games that made them breathe heavily. Using this questionnaire, the score of 1-1.9 was categorized as \"low\" and scores between 2 and 5 as \"high\" PA. Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the joint association of PA and ST categories with odds of anthropometric measures.\nIn both genders, those students categorized as \"Low PA & High ST\" had the highest levels of BMI z-scores (boys: 0.15\u00b11.12, girls: 0.17\u00b11.08), WC (boys: 69.93\u00b113.89 cm, girls: 67.30\u00b111.26 cm), and hip circumference (boys: 82.41\u00b113.90 cm, girls: 84.05\u00b113.7 cm), as well as the highest prevalence of overweight (boys: 15.32%, girls: 14.04%) (p<0.001 in all comparisons). In linear multivariate model, students with \"High PA & High ST had significant increased levels of z-scores for BMI, WC and hip circumference (p<0.05).\nThe current findings underscore the importance of reducing ST along with increasing PA for prevention and control of excess weight in children and adolescents.","authors":["Djalalinia, Shirin","Qorbani, Mostafa","Rezaei, Negar","Sheidaei, Ali","Mahdavi-Gorabi, Armita","Kasaeian, Amir","Motlagh, Mohammad Esmaeil","Asayesh, Hamid","Safiri, Saeid","Kelishadi, Roya"],"doi":"10.1515\/jpem-2016-0486","first_seen_on":"2017-07-08T05:50:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2191-0251","0334-018X"],"journal":"Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM","last_mentioned_on":1499915586,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28672741?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28693117?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"28672741","pubdate":"2017-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Walter de Gruyter GmbH","subjects":["endocrinology","pediatrics"],"title":"Joint association of screen time and physical activity with anthropometric measures in Iranian children and adolescents: the weight disorders survey of the CASPIAN-IV study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/joint-association-screen-time-physical-activity-anthropometric-measures-iranian-children-adolescents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Joint association of screen time and physical activity with anthropometric measures in Iranian children and adolescents: the weight disorders survey of the CASPIAN-IV study.","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1455659461161232&id=202426883151169","license":"public","citation_ids":[21637665],"posted_on":"2017-07-05T20:05:05+00:00","summary":"Joint association of screen time and physical activity with anthropometric measures in Iranian children and adolescents: the weight disorders survey of the CASPIAN-IV study. \n\nJ Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2017 Jun 23;: \n\nAuthors: Djalalinia S, Qorbani M, Re","author":{"name":"Mrs. Video Game","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/202426883151169","facebook_wall_name":"Mrs. Video Game","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/202426883151169\/picture","id_on_source":"202426883151169"}},{"title":"Joint association of screen time and physical activity with anthropometric measures in Iranian children and adolescents: the weight disorders survey of the CASPIAN-IV study.","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1462609177132927&id=202426883151169","license":"public","citation_ids":[21637665],"posted_on":"2017-07-13T03:13:06+00:00","summary":"Related Articles\n\nJoint association of screen time and physical activity with anthropometric measures in Iranian children and adolescents: the weight disorders survey of the CASPIAN-IV study. \n\nJ Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2017 Jun 23;: \n\nAuthors: Djalalini","author":{"name":"Mrs. Video Game","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/202426883151169","facebook_wall_name":"Mrs. Video Game","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/202426883151169\/picture","id_on_source":"202426883151169"}}]}}
