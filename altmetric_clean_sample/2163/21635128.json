EMT refers to epithelial cells under physiological and pathological conditions that are specific to mesenchymal transition. Curcumin inhibits EMT progression via Wnt signaling. The Wnt signaling pathway is a conservative EMT\u2011related signaling pathway that is involved in the development of various tumors. In the present study, MTS assays were employed to analyze the proliferation of curcumin\u2011treated cells. Naked cuticle homolog\u00a02\u00a0(NKD2), chemokine receptor 4\u00a0(CXCR4) and antibodies associated with EMT were examined in SW620 colorectal cancer cell lines using western blot analysis and real\u2011time qPCR. NKD2 small\u2011interfering RNA\u00a0(siRNA) and CXCR4 expression plasmid was synthesized and transfected into the colorectal cancer cell lines, and NKD2 and CXCR4 expression levels were detected. The results showed that curcumin significantly inhibited the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells and upregulated the expression of NKD2 in SW620 colorectal cancer cells and in the xenograft, resulting in the downregulation of key markers in the Wnt signaling. In addition, the progression of ETM was inhibited due to the overexpression of E\u2011cadherin as\u00a0well\u00a0as the downregulation of vimentin. Curcumin also inhibited tumor metastasis by downregulating the expression of CXCR4 significantly. The results suggested involvement of the NKD2\u2011Wnt\u2011CXCR4 signaling pathway in colorectal cancer cells. In addition, curcumin is inhibit this signaling and the development of colorectal cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000837e","authors":["Zewei Zhang","Haitao Chen","Chao Xu","Lu Song","Lulu Huang","Yuebiao Lai","Yuqi Wang","Hanlu Chen","Danlin Gu","Lili Ren","Qinghua Yao"],"doi":"10.3892\/or.2016.4669","first_seen_on":"2017-07-08T04:38:41+00:00","issns":["1021-335X","1791-2431"],"journal":"Oncology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1473794626,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26985708"],"pmid":"26985708","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Curcumin inhibits tumor epithelial\u2011mesenchymal transition by downregulating the Wnt signaling pathway and upregulating NKD2 expression in colon cancer cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/curcumin-inhibits-tumor-epithelialmesenchymal-transition-downregulating-wnt-signaling-pathway-upregu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":7237643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229134,"mean":12.80527608856,"rank":188166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229134,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1636,"mean":1.6381529051988,"rank":961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1636,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":0.48511904761905,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
