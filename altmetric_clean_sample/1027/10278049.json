For anisotropic particles with no spatial gradient in the order parameter under external parameters, they exhibit either a continuous phase transition or \"freezing\" of the order parameter fluctuation. They are known as the collective soft-mode, which has a finite cutoff dispersion where the relaxation time diverges. From microscopic dynamics of charged chiral fd-viruses, the soft-mode is revealed with a rotation restoring \"twist\", obtained from both polarized (VV) and depolarized (VH) small angle dynamic light scattering. Here, I have found the minimum spatial coherence length at a lower I-N binodal concentration, which is due to the reverse of electrostatic repulsive forces with an increase in the concentration of charged chiral rods.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f61000898b","authors":["Kyongok Kang"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6sm00528d","endpage":"6399","first_seen_on":"2016-08-05T08:01:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-6848","1744-683X"],"issue":"30","journal":"Soft Matter","last_mentioned_on":1470384085,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2016\/sm\/c6sm00528d","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1039\/C6SM00528D"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/sm\/c6sm00528d","pmid":"27414163","pubdate":"2016-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"6385","title":"Soft-mode of charged chiral fibrous viruses (fd)","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/softmode-charged-chiral-fibrous-viruses-fd"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170298,"mean":6.9145785001388,"rank":6204843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1099531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170298,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257062,"mean":11.980735335192,"rank":182375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":39998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257062,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2438,"mean":2.4156389002872,"rank":1341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":467,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2438,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":2.4603448275862,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"KR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/softmatter\/statuses\/761472161399902208","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10278049],"posted_on":"2016-08-05T08:01:25+00:00","author":{"name":"Soft Matter","url":"http:\/\/www.rsc.org\/softmatter","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/485088826600067072\/WX3coNme_normal.jpeg","description":"Where physics meets chemistry meets biology for fundamental soft matter research.
