Methods A cross-sectional face-to-face survey was conducted with 320 married postpartum women at a large public health center in Lusaka, Zambia, in 2014. Variables were measured using previously validated instruments\u00a0from the Demographic and Health Survey. Data were analyzed using simple and multivariate logistic regression in Stata 12. Results Thirty-seven percent of women report early mixed infant feeding\u00a0prior to six months. Women who experienced intimate partner violence have 2.8 higher adjusted odds of early mixed infant feeding (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Women who experienced emotional violence, specifically, have 1.9 higher adjusted odds of early mixed infant feeding (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while women who experienced sexual violence have 2.3 higher adjusted odds (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). There is also a dose-response relationship between IPV and early mixed infant feeding\u00a0(p < 0.05). Lastly, disclosing one's HIV-positive status to the husband is associated with at least 67\u00a0% lower adjusted odds of early mixed feeding (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Conclusions Intimate partner violence against HIV-positive women, in particular emotional and sexual violence, increases the likelihood of early mixed infant\u00a0feeding, putting infants at greater risk for both mother-to-child transmission of HIV and other infant morbidities. Intimate partner violence should thus\u00a0be given increased attention within the context of infant feeding and HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5013cf058f610003065","authors":["Hampanda, Karen"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10995-016-2087-9","first_seen_on":"2016-08-05T03:55:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-6628","1092-7875"],"journal":"Maternal & Child Health Journal","last_mentioned_on":1471959966,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27449651"],"pmid":"27449651","pubdate":"2016-07-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Gynecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Maternal and Child Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Population Economics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sociology, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["perinatology"],"title":"Intimate Partner Violence Against HIV-Positive Women is Associated with Sub-Optimal Infant Feeding Practices in Lusaka, Zambia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intimate-partner-violence-against-hivpositive-women-associated-suboptimal-infant-feeding-practices-l-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":5977190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1994598,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258276,"mean":11.978595295712,"rank":167102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":75738,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258276,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1077,"mean":7.5227267657993,"rank":807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1077,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":19.233655913978,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HIV_Insight\/statuses\/761410182735945728","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10275593],"posted_on":"2016-08-05T03:55:08+00:00","author":{"name":"HIV Insight","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/587408973\/INSIGHT_ICON_normal.gif","description":"HIV, AIDS, STI, STD, HPV, Sexuality, LGBT, et al.
