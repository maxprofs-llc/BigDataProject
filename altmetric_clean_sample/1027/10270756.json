To date, empirical research on the martial arts has lacked sophistication in the questions it has posed and in the methodology adopted to answer them. Whilst not entirely consistent, findings from studies of martial artists' personalities, outlooks and behaviour have generally indicated positive psychological effects of training. Clinical and psychotherapeutic applications are at an exploratory stage but appear promising. As an exemplar the psychological facets of the art of Aikido are discussed, and prospective uses of martial arts principles as systemic or adjunctive therapies are considered.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000244a","authors":["Fuller, J R"],"first_seen_on":"2016-08-04T20:38:28+00:00","issns":["0007-1129"],"journal":"British Journal of Medical Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1470329460,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3155357"],"pmid":"3155357","pubdate":"1988-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Martial arts and psychological health.","type":"article","volume":"61 ( Pt 4)","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/martial-arts-psychological-health-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166192,"mean":6.9129712202356,"rank":1553596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6593044,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166192,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257712,"mean":11.992068836797,"rank":64284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":192867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257712,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":3.5848764044944,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
