The YchF subfamily, interestingly, possesses the unique ability to bind both ATP and GTP, and is possibly an ancestral form of G proteins based on phylogenetic studies and is present in all kingdoms of life. However, the biological significance of such a relaxed ligand specificity has long eluded researchers. Here, we have elucidated the different conformational changes caused by the binding of a YchF homolog in rice (OsYchF1) to ATP versus GTP by X-ray crystallography. Furthermore, by comparing the 3D relationships of the ligand position and the various amino acid residues at the binding sites in the crystal structures of the apo-bound and ligand-bound versions, a mechanism for the protein's ability to bind both ligands is revealed. Mutation of the noncanonical G4 motif of the OsYchF1 to the canonical sequence for GTP specificity precludes the binding\/hydrolysis of ATP and prevents OsYchF1 from functioning as a negative regulator of plant-defense responses, while retaining its ability to bind\/hydrolyze GTP and its function as a negative regulator of abiotic stress responses, demonstrating the specific role of ATP-binding\/hydrolysis in disease resistance. This discovery will have a significant impact on our understanding of the structure-function relationships of the YchF subfamily of G proteins in all kingdoms of life.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Cheung, Ming-Yan","Li, Xiaorong","Miao, Rui","Fong, Yu-Hang","Li, Kwan-Pok","Yung, Yuk-Lin","Yu, Mei-Hui","Wong, Kam-Bo","Chen, Zhongzhou","Lam, Hon-Ming"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1522966113","endpage":"2653","first_seen_on":"2016-08-04T20:00:25+00:00","issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"issue":"10","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1470340808,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26912459?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26912459","pubdate":"2016-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"2648","subjects":["science"],"title":"ATP binding by the P-loop NTPase OsYchF1 (an unconventional G protein) contributes to biotic but not abiotic stress responses","type":"article","volume":"113","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/atp-binding-ploop-ntpase-osychf1-unconventional-g-protein-contributes-biotic-not-abiotic-stress-resp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166192,"mean":6.9129712202356,"rank":4327731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2267225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166192,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257712,"mean":11.992005587654,"rank":141473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":90418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257712,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46189,"mean":23.913703949078,"rank":35567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":4579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46189,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":922,"mean":63.140095548317,"rank":770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":922,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
