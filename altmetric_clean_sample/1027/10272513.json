When conservative treatment fails, a lumbar discectomy can be performed. Surgical treatment via lumbar discectomy is not always successful and may depend on a variety of pre-operative factors. It remains unclear which, if any, pre-operative factors can predict postsurgical clinical outcomes.\nTo determine pre-operative predictors that are associated with postsurgical clinical outcomes in patients undergoing lumbar discectomy.\nA systematic review.\nThis systematic review of the scientific literature followed the PRISMA guidelines. MEDLINE and PubMed were systematically searched through June 2014. Results were screened for relevance independently, and full-text studies were assessed for eligibility. Reporting quality was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Quality of evidence was assessed using a modified version of Sackett's Criteria of Evidence Support. No financial support was provided for this study. No potential conflict of interest-associated biases were present from any of the authors.\nThe search strategy yielded 1,147 studies, of which a total of 40 high quality studies were included. There were 17 positive predictors, 20 negative predictors, 43 non-significant predictors and 15 conflicting predictors determined. Pre-operative predictors associated with positive post-operative outcomes included: more severe leg pain, better mental health status, shorter duration of symptoms, and younger age. Pre-operative predictors associated with negative post-operative outcomes included: intact annulus fibrosus, longer duration of sick leave, worker's compensation, and greater severity of baseline symptoms. Several pre-operative factors including motor deficit, side and level of herniation, presence of type 1 modic changes and degeneration, age, and gender had non-significant associations with post-operative clinical outcomes.\nIt may be possible for certain pre-operative factors to be targeted for clinical evaluation by spine surgeons to assess the suitability of patients for lumbar discectomy surgery; the hope being to thereby improve post-operative clinical outcomes. Prospective cohort studies are required to increase the level of evidence with regards to significant predictive factors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a8","authors":["Courtney A.
