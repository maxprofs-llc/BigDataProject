Recent work has highlighted how immune-inflammatory processes and their interactions with oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&amp;NS), couple to drive changes in neuroregulatory tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT), with consequences for serotonin availability for the melatonergic pathways. Such work significantly questions the validity and utility of non-biologically based current classification systems for psychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions. The biological underpinnings of Alzheimer&amp;#039;s disease, Parkinson&amp;#039;s disease and multiple sclerosis are reviewed and overlapped with the biological changes associated with MDD. This is done in the context of integrating alterations in immune-inflammation, O&amp;NS, TRYCATs and the melatonergic pathways. Such a model better integrates wider aspects of current research, including the role of the gut-brain axis, which involves alterations in gut microbiota and increases in the levels of gut permeability in driving changes centrally.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002584","authors":["Guidi, Sandra","Bianchi, Patrizia","Stagni, Fiorenza","Giacomini, Andrea","Emili, Marco","Trazzi, Stefania","Ciani, Elisabetta","Bartesaghi, Renata"],"first_seen_on":"2016-08-05T10:03:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1996-3181"],"journal":"CNS & Neurological Disorders - Drug Targets","last_mentioned_on":1471043664,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27488422?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27488422?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27488422"],"pmid":"27488422","pubdate":"2016-08-05T22:04:28+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Lithium Restores Age Related Olfactory Impairment in the Ts65Dn Mouse Model of Down Syndrome.","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204367,"mean":6.945700472644,"rank":873362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7324882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204367,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257328,"mean":11.984289483808,"rank":39729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":217173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257328,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":491,"mean":4.6392571428571,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":491,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":3.8055555555556,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Lithium Restores Age Related Olfactory Impairment in the Ts65Dn Mouse Model of Down Syndrome.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=27596152007&p=1pl&v=1&x=BDqzBQCwyCq_Y0CBtEnxAg","license":"public","citation_ids":[10279607],"posted_on":"2016-08-12T23:14:24+00:00","summary":"Guidi S, Bianchi P, Stagni F, Giacomini A, Emili M, Trazzi S, Ciani E, Bartesaghi R.","author":{"name":"Alzforum","url":"http:\/\/www.alzforum.org","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/355\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-04-08_at_12.16.09_1.png?1428491784"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MicrobiomePaper\/statuses\/761502812790370304","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10279607],"posted_on":"2016-08-05T10:03:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Microbiome Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585212126173732865\/jEvg1KpB_normal.jpg","description":"The latest PubMed publications on Microbiome Research delivered direct to your Twitter Feed.
