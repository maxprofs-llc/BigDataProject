Subjects who screened positive then underwent confirmatory oral salt load testing (OSLT).\nOf the 296 patients, 14 screened positive for PA, an overall prevalence of 4.7%. Six of the 14 cases underwent confirmatory OSLT, upon which 2 were confirmed positive, for a prevalence of 0.7%. Overall, patients with confirmed PA were more likely to have resistant hypertension (42.9% vs. 18.1% (P = .0334)) and require more antihypertensive agents (2.8 \u00b1 1.2 agents vs. 2.1 \u00b1 1.1 agents, P = .0213). There was a trend toward lower potassium values in the cases.\nThe prevalence of PA in our clinic is much lower than in reports from certain \"at-risk\" populations. PA screening is indicated in patients with resistant hypertension, regardless of serum potassium levels.\nARR = aldosterone:renin ratio ACTH = adrenocorticotropic hormone AVS = adrenal venous sampling BP = blood pressure MRA = mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist OSLT = oral salt load confirmatory test PA = primary aldosteronism PAC = plasma aldosterone concentration PCP = primary care provider PRA = plasma renin activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f61000727c","authors":["Sandi-Jo Galati","Khadeen C.
