Meta-analyses demonstrated association of a broad array of fasting and 1-h metabolites, including lipids and amino acids and their metabolites, with maternal BMI, glucose levels, and insulin sensitivity before and after adjustment for the different phenotypes. At fasting and 1 h, a mix of metabolites was identified that were common across phenotypes or associated with only one or two phenotypes. Partial correlation estimates, which allowed comparison of the strength of association of different metabolites with maternal phenotypes, demonstrated that metabolites most strongly associated with different phenotypes included some that were common across as well as unique to each phenotype.\nMaternal BMI and glycemia have metabolic signatures that are both shared and unique to each phenotype. These signatures largely remain consistent across different ancestry groups and may contribute to the common and independent effects of these two phenotypes on adverse pregnancy outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f8","authors":["Saya Jacob","Michael Nodzenski","Anna C.
