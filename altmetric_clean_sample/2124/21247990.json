Parental supervision and monitoring of adolescent diabetes management have been shown to promote better diabetes management among adolescents, but parents typically decrease their oversight during the transition to independent diabetes care.\nThe purpose of the study was to conduct a randomized clinical trial to test the feasibility and efficacy of a three-session, computer-delivered motivational intervention (The 3Ms) to promote increased parental monitoring among primary caregivers of young African American adolescents with T1D. The intervention was brief and optimized for delivery during routine diabetes clinic visits.\nSixty-seven adolescents with T1D aged 11-14 and their primary caregiver were randomly assigned to one of three arms: adolescent and parent motivational intervention (Arm 1), adolescent control and parent motivational intervention (Arm 2), or adolescent and parent control (Arm 3). Intervention effects were assessed 1 month after intervention completion.\nParents in Arm 1 and Arm 2 had significant increases in knowledge of the importance of monitoring adolescents' diabetes care. Parents in Arm 2 also had trend to significant increases in direct observation and monitoring of adolescent diabetes care, and adolescents in Arm 2 had significant improvements in glycemic control.\nFindings from the present study provide preliminary support for the efficacy of a brief, computer-delivered parenting intervention for improving family management practices and adolescent health outcomes among African American adolescents with T1D and their caregivers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008aff","authors":["EllisDeborah A.","Idalski CarconeApril","OndersmaSteven J.","Naar-KingSylvie","DekelbabBassem","MoltzKathleen"],"doi":"10.1089\/tmj.2016.0182","first_seen_on":"2017-06-21T22:05:28+00:00","issns":["1530-5627","1556-3669"],"journal":"Telemedicine Journal (now called Telemedicine Journal and e-Health)","last_mentioned_on":1498082711,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1089\/tmj.2016.0182"],"pmid":"28061319","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":" Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.  140 Huguenot Street, 3rd Floor New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA  ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["healthservices","medicalinformatics"],"title":"Brief Computer-Delivered Intervention to Increase Parental Monitoring in Families of African American Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes: A Randomized Controlled Trial","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/brief-computerdelivered-intervention-increase-parental-monitoring-families-african-american-adolesce-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":6377675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1140368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237167,"mean":12.930729927561,"rank":168343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237167,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":856,"mean":5.0218339181287,"rank":676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":856,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":3.2674418604651,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Telemedicine_Jn\/statuses\/877648618898980865","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21247990],"posted_on":"2017-06-21T22:05:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Telemedicine Journal","url":"http:\/\/www.liebertpub.com\/tmj","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3109423521\/4852ae7f0632af5451b34532d2487388_normal.jpeg","description":"Telemedicine and e-Health provides innovative solutions in patient care and records management, peer-reviewed applications, industry news, and product reviews.","id_on_source":"Telemedicine_Jn","tweeter_id":"71105920","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5317},"tweet_id":"877648618898980865"}]}}
