Despite many efforts to protect against ischemic stroke, its incidence and related permanent disabilities continue to increase. In this study, we found that pretreatment with phlorofucofuroeckol (PFF), isolated from brown algae species, significantly increased cell viability in glutamate-stimulated PC12 cells. Additionally, glutamate-stimulated cells showed irregular morphology, but PFF pretreatment resulted in improved cell morphology, which resembled that in cells cultured under normal conditions. We further showed that PFF pretreatment effectively inhibited glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death in a caspase-dependent manner. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by oxidative stress are closely associated with ischemia-induced neurological diseases. Exposure of PC12 cells to glutamate induced abundant production of intracellular ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction, which was attenuated by PFF in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo studies revealed that PFF-mediated prevention was achieved predominantly through inhibition of apoptosis and mitochondrial ROS generation. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility of PFF as a neuroprotective agent in ischemic stroke.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Jwa-Jin Kim","Yoon-Joong Kang","Sun-Ae Shin","Dong-Ho Bak","Jae Won Lee","Kyung Bok Lee","Yung Choon Yoo","Do-Kyung Kim","Bong Ho Lee","Dong Woon Kim","Jina Lee","Eun-Kyeong Jo","Jae-Min Yuk"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0163433","first_seen_on":"2016-09-26T17:40:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1474914956,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0163433&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0163433"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0163433.PDF","pmid":"27669570","pubdate":"2016-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0163433","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Phlorofucofuroeckol Improves Glutamate-Induced Neurotoxicity through Modulation of Oxidative Stress-Mediated Mitochondrial Dysfunction in PC12 Cells","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phlorofucofuroeckol-improves-glutamate-induced-neurotoxicity-through-modulation-oxidative-stressmedi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":6400845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1146702,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252952,"mean":12.697091752948,"rank":177067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":45216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252952,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116243,"mean":10.657954353848,"rank":84919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":18288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116243,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4133,"mean":10.12690125847,"rank":3149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":584,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4133,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/neuropapersbot\/statuses\/780461953307127808","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12223819],"posted_on":"2016-09-26T17:40:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Neuroscience Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"hi there, I am a twitter bot who tweets new papers in neuroscience","id_on_source":"neuropapersbot","tweeter_id":"757895584317440000","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":23},"tweet_id":"780461953307127808"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aprendedorweb\/statuses\/780476011502833664","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12223819],"posted_on":"2016-09-26T18:35:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Alex","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/877344770355494917\/nOWNu028_normal.jpg","description":"Aprende de todo, Aprende de todos.","id_on_source":"aprendedorweb","tweeter_id":"2806836826","geo":{"lt":32.65002,"ln":-115.46107,"country":"MX"},"followers":1278},"tweet_id":"780476011502833664"}]}}
