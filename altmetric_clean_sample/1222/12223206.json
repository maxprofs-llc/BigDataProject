This therapy kills cancer cells by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) after irradiation with specific laser wavelengths. Being a potential photosensitizer, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) quantum dots (QDs) are noncytotoxic. Although the use of g-C3N4 QDs is challenged by the limited tissue penetration of UV light, g-C3N4 QDs display excellent ultraviolet (UV) light-triggered cytotoxicity. The g-C3N4 QDs were synthesized using a solid-phase hydrothermal method. The well-distributed hydrophilic g-C3N4 can be combined with NaYF4:Yb(3+)\/Tm(3+) upconversion nanoparticles via the positive ligand poly(l-lysine) to produce the final nanocomposite, NaYF4:Yb\/Tm-PLL@g-C3N4. Upconversion nanoparticles can transfer IR light into UV light and promote g-C3N4 to release blue-to-green visible light to generate different images. Moreover, g-C3N4 is a promising photosensitizer in PDT because g-C3N4 can transfer oxygen into toxic ROS. The singlet oxygen formed by g-C3N4 displays great potential for use in the treatment of cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Ming-Hsien Chan"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b01522","first_seen_on":"2016-09-26T16:58:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1474909089,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b01522"],"pmid":"27667449","pubdate":"2016-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Near-Infrared Light-Mediated Photodynamic Therapy Nanoplatform by the Electrostatic Assembly of Upconversion Nanoparticles with Graphitic Carbon Nitride Quantum Dots","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nearinfrared-lightmediated-photodynamic-therapy-nanoplatform-electrostatic-assembly-upconversion-nan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":7289316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252952,"mean":12.697129704962,"rank":207739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252952,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9309,"mean":1.1446130210572,"rank":5296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9309,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":356,"mean":1.0361971830986,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":356,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
