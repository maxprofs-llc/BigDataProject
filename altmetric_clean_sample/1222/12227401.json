Treatment outcomes are reported to the institutional Antimicrobial Stewardship Program.\nData produced from a continuous quality assurance initiative were utilized. Descriptive statistics were used to present data.\nFrom January 2014 through September 2015 there were 1619 pharmacist encounters for 532 unique patients and 597 screenings (including 578 approvals) were completed by a pharmacist. During this time 555 patients were initiated on at least 1 HCV treatment course, with 565 total treatment courses initiated. As new agents became available for use, fluctuation in regimen selection was seen. The most commonly prescribed medications were sofosbuvir (46%), ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir (37%), and simeprevir (33%). Of the 565 HCV treatment courses initiated, 360 were completed, 29 were stopped early during treatment, and 176 were ongoing. Of the 360 completed courses, 249 had sustained virologic response at week 12 results available, of which 225 (90%) achieved treatment success and 24 (10%) relapsed. Of the 29 courses stopped early, 11 were due to poor medication adherence and 8 were due to adverse drug reaction.\nThrough a structured process employing a scope of practice, pharmacists can extend the capacity of medical hepatology providers and provide pharmacotherapy services to enhance care. Information provided here may serve beneficial to others looking to initiate or expand existing HCV pharmacist services.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e97","authors":["Timothy P.
