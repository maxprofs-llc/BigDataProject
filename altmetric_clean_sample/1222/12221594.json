The purpose of this study is to report the results of hip arthroscopy in orthopaedic surgeons who represent the most informed cohort. This report is based on a retrospective review of prospectively collected data among 24 orthopaedic surgeons (1 bilateral). Follow-up averaged 48 months (range 12-120 months). They were all males with an average age of 45 years (range 30-64 years). All improved with an average of 18 points (preoperative 75; post-operative 93); although one underwent repeat arthroscopy and one was converted to total hip arthroplasty at 54 months. There were numerous diagnoses and procedures performed and one complication (acute coronary artery occlusion). They resumed seeing patients at an average of 1.6 weeks (range 2 days-4 weeks) and operating at an average of 3.1 weeks (range 6 days-8 weeks). This report spans three decades, thus representing a heterogeneous population in terms of diagnoses and treatment. Nonetheless, successful results are noted. As a cohort, orthopaedic surgeons possess the greatest insight into hip arthroscopy, but as patients, often they must modulate their expectations in order to match the understanding of the realities of the procedure.","altmetric_jid":"554b869a2a83ee864e8b45d9","authors":["J.
