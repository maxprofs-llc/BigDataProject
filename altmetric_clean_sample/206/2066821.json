Reported here is a new hybrid bi-layer (BL) approach to fabricate fire retardant coatings on polyurethane foam. Utilizing hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction along with the pH adjustment, a fast growing coating with significant fire retardant clay content was achieved. This hybrid BL coating exhibits significant fire performance improvement in both bench scale and real scale tests. Cone calorimetry bench scale tests show a 42% and 71% reduction in peak and average heat release rates, respectively. Real scale furniture mockups constructed using the hybrid LbL coating reduced the peak and average heat release rates by 53% and 63%, respectively. This is the first time that the fire safety in a real scale test has been reported for any LbL technology. This hybrid LbL coating is the fastest approach to develop an effective fire retardant coating for polyurethane foam.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Yeon Seok Kim"],"doi":"10.1021\/am405259n","first_seen_on":"2014-01-23T13:31:06+00:00","issns":["1944-8244"],"journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1390483820,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/am405259n"],"pmid":"24422757","pubdate":"2014-01-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
