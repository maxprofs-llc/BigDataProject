Conflicting data are reported concerning HSA contamination by small, naked viruses such as the erythrovirus B19 (B19V) and the anellovirus torquetenovirus (TTV). This study has been performed to assess the effect of the HSA purification procedures on the viral contamination.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000368b","doi":"10.1111\/j.1537-2995.2006.00866.x","endpage":"1167","first_seen_on":"2014-01-22T14:14:48+00:00","issns":["1537-2995"],"issue":"7","journal":"Transfusion","last_mentioned_on":1390399411,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1537-2995.2006.00866.x\/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1537-2995.2006.00866.x\/pdf","pmid":"16836563","pubdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"1162","subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Different behavior of erythrovirus B19 and torquetenovirus in response to a single step of albumin purification","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/different-behavior-erythrovirus-b19-torquetenovirus-response-single-step-albumin-purification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229412,"mean":5.9660401858233,"rank":4606860,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229412,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147851,"mean":7.9962763476498,"rank":98853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":27587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147851,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":957,"mean":2.7053368200837,"rank":716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":957,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.507,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bioseparations\/status\/425992124551933953","license":"public","citation_ids":[2063549],"posted_on":"2014-01-22T14:03:31+00:00","author":{"name":"BiotechSupportGroup","url":"http:\/\/www.biotechsupportgroup.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000846313029\/1be54b9e8e834a6c7ac02bbd3c588318_normal.png","description":"Chromatography columns, media, and separation sciences","id_on_source":"bioseparations","tweeter_id":"2236259306","geo":{"lt":40.379,"ln":-74.54654,"country":"US"},"followers":175},"tweet_id":"425992124551933953"}]}}
