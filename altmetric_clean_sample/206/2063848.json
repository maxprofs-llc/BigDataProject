This study examined the effect the time-saving bias may have on drivers' choice of speed using hypothetical situations. Drivers were presented with a situation involving acceleration from a relatively low speed in order to arrive at a destination on time and were asked to estimate the time that could be saved by increasing to higher speeds. Drivers also estimated the speed required for arriving on time, the speed they would personally choose and the speed they believed other drivers would opt for in such a situation. Results showed that drivers indeed underestimated the time that could be saved by increasing from a low speed. In addition, drivers who showed a high time-saving bias (above median) indicated notably higher speeds in all three categories above and their indicated speeds exceeded the speed limit more frequently. These findings suggest that the time-saving bias may help explain why drivers, in some situations, prefer an overly high speed and violate the legal speed limit.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000213e","authors":["Peer E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aap.2010.06.003","first_seen_on":"2014-01-22T16:10:19+00:00","issns":["0001-4575"],"issue":"6","journal":"Accident Analysis & Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1392804670,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20728651"],"pmid":"20728651","pubdate":"2010-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Transportation And Freight Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Speeding and the time-saving bias: how drivers' estimations of time saved in higher speed affects their choice of speed.","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/speeding-timesaving-bias-drivers-estimations-time-saved-higher-speed-affects-choice-speed"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632750,"mean":4.9231796234803,"rank":157728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":3473316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632750,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109920,"mean":7.1471548685853,"rank":7071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":102759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109920,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1127,"mean":3.8444653641208,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":1072,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1127,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":0.7063829787234,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
