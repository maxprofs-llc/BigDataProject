The first aim of this study was to detect which EF components are common to the ASD continuum (from high- to low-functioning ASD) and identify a possible EF profile for ASD people. Planning, mental flexibility, inhibition of response, generativity, and ecologic EF were investigated. This study was extended not only to high-functioning ASD, but also to ASD with intellectual disability (ID). The second aim was to find EF aspects correlating with adaptive skills in ASD. A total of 61 children participated in the study (27\u2009ASD with and without ID and 34 controls). Results highlight an executive profile characterised by impaired flexibility and deficient planning; these deficits are associated with decreased adaptive ability, particularly socialization, and a deficient shifting in ecologic conditions. These features are present in all ASD subgroups with and without ID; for this reason, they might be assumed as being specific features in ASD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b546f","authors":["Panerai, Simonetta"],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/941809","first_seen_on":"2014-01-21T17:39:01+00:00","issns":["2314-4327"],"journal":"Psychiatry Journal","last_mentioned_on":1401808440,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/psychiatry\/2014\/941809\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24829905"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/psychiatry\/2014\/941809.pdf","pmid":"24829905","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Executive Functions and Adaptive Behaviour in Autism Spectrum Disorders with and without Intellectual Disability","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/executive-functions-adaptive-behaviour-autism-spectrum-disorders-without-intellectual-disability"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.418,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.418},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4759378,"mean":5.7095406108846,"rank":557568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":4201722,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4759378,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127580,"mean":8.0847575854962,"rank":17836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":109739,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127580,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
