In addition, several ad hoc stopping rules for dimension determination are reviewed and a modification of the broken stick model is presented. The modification incorporates a test for the presence of an \"effective degeneracy\" among the subspaces spanned by the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix of the data set then allocates the total variance among subspaces. A summary of the performance of the methods applied to both published microarray data sets and to simulated data is given.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007e5","authors":["Cangelosi R","Goriely A","Richard Cangelosi","Alain Goriely"],"doi":"10.1186\/1745-6150-2-2","first_seen_on":"2014-01-24T06:17:59+00:00","issns":["","17456150"],"journal":"Biology Direct","last_mentioned_on":1488340744,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1745-6150-2-2","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1797006\/"],"pmcid":"PMC1797006","pmid":"17229320","pubdate":"2007-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Computational Biology\/Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Mathematical Biology in General","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Component retention in principal component analysis with application to cDNA microarray data.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/biologydirect.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1745-6150-2-2","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/component-retention-principal-component-analysis-application-cdna-microarray-data-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":4411401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2307862,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191206,"mean":7.4799957741693,"rank":91568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":76344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191206,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":527,"mean":6.0110684410646,"rank":278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":527,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.125,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":28,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
