Five volunteers were studied during recovery while they ingested, immediately after exercise, a 600-ml bolus and then every 15 min a 150-ml bolus containing 1) 1.67 g. kg body wt(-1). l(-1) of sucrose and 0.5 g. kg body wt(-1). l(-1) of a whey protein hydrolysate (CHO\/protein), 2) 1.67 g. kg body wt(-1). l(-1) of sucrose (CHO), and 3) water. CHO\/protein and CHO ingestion caused an increased arterial glucose concentration compared with water ingestion during 4 h of recovery. With CHO ingestion, glucose concentration was 1-1.5 mmol\/l higher during the first hour of recovery compared with CHO\/protein ingestion. Leg glucose uptake was initially 0.7 mmol\/min with water ingestion and decreased gradually with no measurable glucose uptake observed at 3 h of recovery. Leg glucose uptake was rather constant at 0.9 mmol\/min with CHO\/protein and CHO ingestion, and insulin levels were stable at 70, 45, and 5 mU\/l for CHO\/protein, CHO, and water ingestion, respectively. Glycogen resynthesis rates were 52 +\/- 7, 48 +\/- 5, and 18 +\/- 6 for the first 1.5 h of recovery and decreased to 30 +\/- 6, 36 +\/- 3, and 8 +\/- 6 mmol. kg dry muscle(-1). h(-1) between 1.5 and 4 h for CHO\/protein, CHO, and water ingestion, respectively. No differences could be observed between CHO\/protein and CHO ingestion ingestion. It is concluded that coingestion of carbohydrate and protein, compared with ingestion of carbohydrate alone, did not increase leg glucose uptake or glycogen resynthesis rate further when carbohydrate was ingested in sufficient amounts every 15 min to induce an optimal rate of glycogen resynthesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b71","authors":["G van Hall","S M Shirreffs","J A Calbet","van Hall, G","Shirreffs, S M","Calbet, J A"],"first_seen_on":"2014-01-23T18:35:18+00:00","issns":["8750-7587"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Applied Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1390502106,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10797123"],"pmid":"10797123","pubdate":"2000-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Muscle glycogen resynthesis during recovery from cycle exercise: no effect of additional protein ingestion.","type":"article","volume":"88","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/muscle-glycogen-resynthesis-during-recovery-cycle-exercise-effect-additional-protein-ingestion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7714722,"mean":6.6201947422264,"rank":5834475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1040435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7714722,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186543,"mean":7.3011453292023,"rank":120216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":34926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186543,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3352,"mean":9.7876908385557,"rank":2703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3352,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":12.4724,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
