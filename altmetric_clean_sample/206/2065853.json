The Seattle Longitudinal Study has assessed mental abilities in more than 5,000 adults and has followed some for as long as 35 years. Integrative findings are provided on patterns and magnitudes of age changes, cohort differences, factor structure of mental abilities, antecedents for individual differences in aging trajectories, and interventions designed to remediate cognitive aging effects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002231","authors":["K W Schaie"],"first_seen_on":"2014-01-23T04:38:26+00:00","issns":["0003-066X"],"issue":"4","journal":"American Psychologist","last_mentioned_on":1390453301,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8203802"],"pmid":"8203802","pubdate":"1994-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"The course of adult intellectual development.","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/course-adult-intellectual-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8040368,"mean":6.8299370028724,"rank":3216236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4799952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8040368,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189243,"mean":7.4218055399966,"rank":58734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":129776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189243,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1683,"mean":7.3793067776457,"rank":1345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1683,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":12.933333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":20,"Student  > Doctoral Student":18,"Researcher":27,"Student  > Ph.
