The method is general, it mitigates the masking of intrinsic affinity gains by multivalency and enables the discovery of potential hits when starting from ligands that exhibit extremely low affinity with proteins that depend on multivalency for their function.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Dasgupta, Somnath","Kitov, Pavel I.","Sadowska, Joanna M.","Bundle, David R."],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201309436","endpage":"1515","first_seen_on":"2014-01-23T02:35:29+00:00","issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"6","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
