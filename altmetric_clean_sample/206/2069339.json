However, highly expressed genes in flowering plants were shown to be less compact than lowly expressed ones. On the other hand, opposite facts have also been documented that pollen-expressed Arabidopsis genes tend to contain shorter introns and highly expressed moss genes are compact. This issue is important because it provides a chance to compare the selectionism and the neutralism views about genome evolution. Furthermore, this issue also helps to understand the fates of introns, from the angle of gene expression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007e5","authors":["Yang H"],"doi":"10.1186\/1745-6150-4-45","first_seen_on":"2014-01-24T06:08:14+00:00","issns":[""],"journal":"Biology Direct","last_mentioned_on":1256860800,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1745-6150-4-45"],"pmcid":"PMC2794262","pmid":"19930585","pubdate":"2009-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"In plants, expression breadth and expression level distinctly and non-linearly correlate with gene structure.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plants-expression-breadth-expression-level-distinctly-nonlinearly-correlate-gene-structure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3620975,"mean":4.9297103293237,"rank":2016156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":927547,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3620975,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109162,"mean":7.0616140379807,"rank":54887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":30285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109162,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":428,"mean":4.4281264637002,"rank":185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":428,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.1,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
