During human parturition myometrial PR expression is altered to favour PR-A, which activates pro-labour genes. We have previously identified histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) as an activator of myometrial PR-A expression at labour. To further elucidate the mechanisms regulating PR isoform expression in the human uterus at labour, we have (i) determined the methylation profile of the cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) island in the promoter region of the PR gene and (ii) identified the histone-modifying enzymes that target the H3K4me3 mark at the PR promoters in term and preterm human myometrial tissues obtained before and after labour onset. Bisulphite sequencing showed that despite overall low levels of PR CpG island methylation, there was a significant decrease in methylated CpGs with labour in both preterm (P < 0.05) and term (P < 0.01) groups downstream of the PR-B transcription start site. This methylation change was not associated with altered PR-B expression, but may contribute to the increase in PR-A expression with labour. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that the histone methyltransferase, SET and MYND domain-containing protein 3 (SMYD3), bound to the PR gene at significantly higher levels at the PR-A promoter compared with the PR-B promoter (P < 0.010), with no labour-associated changes observed. The H3K4 demethylase, Jumonji AT-rich interactive domain 1A (JARID1A), also bound to the PR-A, but not to the PR-B promoter prior to term labour, and decreased significantly at the onset of labour (P = 0.014), providing a mechanism for the previously reported increase in H3K4me3 level and PR-A expression with labour. Our studies suggest that epigenetic changes mediated by JARID1A, SMYD3 and DNA methylation may be responsible, at least in part, for the functional progesterone withdrawal that precipitates human labour.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62d3cf058f610008180","authors":["S Y Chai","R Smith","J T Fitter","C Mitchell","X Pan","M Illicic","K Maiti","T Zakar","G Madsen"],"doi":"10.1093\/molehr\/gau005","first_seen_on":"2014-01-22T00:19:55+00:00","issns":["1460-2407"],"journal":"MHR : Basic Science of Reproductive Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1419961636,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24442343"],"pmid":"24442343","pubdate":"2014-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Increased progesterone receptor A expression in labouring human myometrium is associated with decreased promoter occupancy by the histone demethylase JARID1A.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-progesterone-receptor-expression-labouring-human-myometrium-associated-decreased-promoter"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":3799626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":145652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123775,"mean":8.0023225394672,"rank":99275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123775,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":424,"mean":2.733243498818,"rank":331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":424,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.8,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
