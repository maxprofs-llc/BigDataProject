Among the other, RNAi is involved in silencing of transposable elements and in inhibition of virus infection in various eukaryotic organisms. Recent experimental studies demonstrate few cases of viral replication suppression via complementary interactions between the mammalian small RNAs and viral transcripts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007e5","authors":["Zabolotneva A","Tkachev V","Filatov F","Buzdin A"],"doi":"10.1186\/1745-6150-5-62","first_seen_on":"2014-01-24T06:05:19+00:00","issns":[""],"journal":"Biology Direct","last_mentioned_on":1287529200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1745-6150-5-62"],"pmcid":"PMC2992506","pmid":"21059241","pubdate":"2010-11-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"How many antiviral small interfering RNAs may be encoded by the mammalian genomes?","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiviral-small-interfering-rnas-encoded-mammalian-genomes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633792,"mean":4.9212574058383,"rank":2015205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633792,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109910,"mean":7.1056803537475,"rank":55003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":30957,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109910,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":429,"mean":4.3927990654206,"rank":185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":429,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.1,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
