Phylogenetic analyses showed that Wnt5 gene has been duplicated at the divergence time of gnathostomata from agnatha. Interestingly, experimental data for some species indicated that only one of the two Wnt5 paralogs participates in the development of the endocrine pancreas. The purpose of this paper is to reexamine the phylogenetic history of the Wnt5 developmental regulators and investigate the functional shift between paralogs through comparative genomics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007e5","authors":["Kapasa M","Arhondakis S","Kossida S"],"doi":"10.1186\/1745-6150-5-49","first_seen_on":"2014-01-24T06:17:44+00:00","issns":[""],"journal":"Biology Direct","last_mentioned_on":1265414400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1745-6150-5-49"],"pmcid":"PMC2922100","pmid":"20684756","pubdate":"2010-08-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Phylogenetic and regulatory region analysis of Wnt5 genes reveals conservation of a regulatory module with putative implication in pancreas development.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phylogenetic-regulatory-region-analysis-wnt5-genes-reveals-conservation-regulatory-module-putative-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628714,"mean":4.9390391673343,"rank":2016719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":937431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628714,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109596,"mean":7.1182587526806,"rank":54998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":30616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109596,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":428,"mean":4.4244449648712,"rank":185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":428,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.1,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
