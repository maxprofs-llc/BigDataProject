Continuous release of fluoxetine results in increased effective exposure duration in surface waters, resulting in a chronic exposure for animals downstream, particularly in effluent dominated ecosystems. Fluoxetine is known to cause disruptions in reproductive behavior of freshwater mussels (order Unionoida), including stimulating release of gametes, parturition of glochidia (larvae), and changes in lure display and foot protrusion. However, the ecological relevance of these effects at environmental concentrations is unknown. We conducted a 67-d exposure of adult Lampsilis fasciola to fluoxetine concentrations of 0, 0.5, 2.5, and 22.3\u03bcg\/L and assessed impacts on behavior (lateral movement, burrowing, and filtering) and metabolism (glycogen storage and respiration). Mussels treated with 2.5 and 22.3\u03bcg\/L fluoxetine displayed mantle lures significantly (p<0.05) more than controls. Animals treated with 22.3\u03bcg\/L fluoxetine were statistically more likely to have shorter time-to-movement, greater total movement, and initiate burrowing sooner than control animals. These observations suggest that increased activity of mussels exposed to fluoxetine may result in increased susceptibility to predators and may lead to a reduction in energy stores.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022f3","authors":["Peter D Hazelton","Bowen Du","Samuel P Haddad","Andrea K Fritts","C Kevin Chambliss","Bryan W Brooks","Robert B Bringolf"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aquatox.2013.12.019","first_seen_on":"2014-01-21T23:08:06+00:00","issns":["1879-1514"],"journal":"Aquatic Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1498000941,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24438840?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24438840","https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/259510211_Chronic_fluoxetine_exposure_alters_movement_and_burrowing_in_adult_freshwater_mussels"],"pmid":"24438840","pubdate":"2013-12-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Chronic fluoxetine exposure alters movement and burrowing in adult freshwater mussels","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chronic-fluoxetine-exposure-alters-movement-burrowing-adult-freshwater-mussels"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":3612858,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4747127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190746,"mean":7.5219292353668,"rank":65924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":123793,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190746,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1045,"mean":2.6410191570881,"rank":406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1045,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":8.4351428571429,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
