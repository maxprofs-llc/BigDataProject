Accompanying this is the emergence of a new subtype of Cryptosporidium hominis based on variation at the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) locus, IaA28R4, which has become a frequently identified subtype in both sporadic and outbreak-related cases. In this study, using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) at eight genetic loci, we characterized 62 specimens of IaA28R4 and 33 specimens of three other gp60 subtypes of C. hominis from four U.S. states with increased cryptosporidiosis incidences during the summer of 2008. Extensive genetic heterogeneity was seen within the gp60 subtype IaA28R4, but specimens from Ohio and southwestern states formed two distinct subpopulations, suggesting that there were at least two origins of IaA28R4 within the United States. Discordance in typing results was observed between gp60 and other genetic markers, especially DZ-HRGP, and this discordance was largely the result of genetic recombination within the gp60 subtype IaA28R4. The results of population genetic analyses supported the presence of two subpopulations of IaA28R4 and the occurrence of genetic recombination within this gp60 subtype. Thus, the IaA28R4 subtype at gp60 is likely a fitness marker for C. hominis, and genetic recombination is potentially a driving force in the emergence of the virulent IaA28R4 subtype in the United States. A rapid evolution of IaA28R4 was indicated by the observation of multiple MLST subtypes of IaA28R4 within two large outbreaks that lasted for extended periods and involved multiple swimming pools.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be9","authors":["Feng, Yaoyu","Tiao, Narry","Li, Na","Hlavsa, Michele","Xiao, Lihua","Y.
