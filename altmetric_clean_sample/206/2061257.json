(N.

The thiophenium salts were found to be efficient as electrophilic difluoromehtylating reagents for introduction of a CF2 H group to sp(3) -hybridized carbon nucleophiles such as of \u03b2-ketoesters and dicyanoalkylidenes. The (phenylsulfonyl)difluoromethyl group can be readily transformed into CF2 H under mild reaction conditions. Enantioselective electrophilic difluoromethylation was also achieved in the presence of bis(cinchona) alkaloids.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Wang, Xin","Liu, Guokai","Xu, Xiu\u2010Hua","Shibata, Naoyuki","Tokunaga, Etsuko","Shibata, Norio"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201309875","endpage":"1831","first_seen_on":"2014-01-21T21:35:17+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"7","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
