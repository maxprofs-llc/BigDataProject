Resistance to T. muris infection is associated with the rapid recruitment of dendritic cells (DCs) to the colonic epithelium via epithelial chemokine production. However, the epithelial-pathogen interactions that drive chemokine production are not known. We addressed the role of the cytosolic pattern recognition receptor Nod2. In response to infection, there was a rapid influx of CD103(+)CD11c(+) DCs into the colonic epithelium in wild-type (WT) mice, whereas this was absent in Nod2(-\/-) animals. In vitro chemotaxis assays and in vivo experiments using bone marrow chimeras of WT mice reconstituted with Nod2(-\/-) bone marrow and infected with T. muris demonstrated that the migratory function of Nod2(-\/-) DCs was normal. Investigation of colonic epithelial cell (CEC) innate responses revealed a significant reduction in epithelial production of the chemokines CCL2 and CCL5 but not CCL20 by Nod2-deficient CECs. Collectively, these data demonstrate the importance of Nod2 in CEC responses to infection and the requirement for functional Nod2 in initiating host epithelial chemokine-mediated responses and subsequent DC recruitment and T-cell responses following infection.Mucosal Immunology advance online publication, 22 January 2014; doi:10.1038\/mi.2013.125.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000423d","authors":["R Bowcutt","M Bramhall","L Logunova","J Wilson","C Booth","S R Carding","R Grencis","S Cruickshank","Bowcutt R","Bramhall M","Logunova L","Wilson J","Booth C","Carding SR","Grencis R","Cruickshank S"],"doi":"10.1038\/mi.2013.125","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2014-01-23T09:24:38+00:00","funders":["wellcome","bbsrc"],"issns":["1933-0219","1935-3456"],"journal":"Mucosal Immunology (1933-0219)","last_mentioned_on":1408452373,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/mi\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/mi2013125a.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/mi\/journal\/v7\/n5\/full\/mi2013125a.html?WT.ec_id=MI-201409"],"pmid":"24448097","pubdate":"2014-01-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"A role for the pattern recognition receptor Nod2 in promoting recruitment of CD103|[plus]| dendritic cells to the colon in response to Trichuris muris infection","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-pattern-recognition-receptor-nod2-promoting-recruitment-cd103-dendritic-cells-colon-response-tr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4681163,"mean":5.6987966927893,"rank":1843970,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":2808692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4681163,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125062,"mean":8.1437980505515,"rank":40118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":83916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125062,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":446,"mean":5.5588314606742,"rank":224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":446,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.5591428571429,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
