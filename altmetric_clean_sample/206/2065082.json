Plants were grown in three experimental agriculture greenhouse fields (A1, A2 and A3). Soil composition was also monitored to understand its influence on lettuce composition. In general, the content of macrominerals, trace elements, chlorophylls and carotenoids decreased during lettuce growth and consequently, high nutritional value was observed at younger stages. A2 lettuces showed an increase of Fe, Al, Cr, V and Pb due to the different soil physicochemical parameters. Multiple linear regression analysis with stepwise variable selection, indicated that soil characteristics, namely, pH(CaCl2) for Fe and Cr, silt and fine-sand for Al and V, OM for Al and Pb, coarse-sand and CEC for Cr, had a key role determining element bioavailability and plant mineral content. Thus, lettuce nutritional value was strongly dependent of growth stage and soil characteristics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f5","authors":["Edgar Pinto","Agostinho A Almeida","Ana A R M Aguiar","Isabel M P L V O Ferreira"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.foodchem.2013.12.023","first_seen_on":"2014-01-23T00:19:18+00:00","issns":["0308-8146"],"journal":"Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1390415518,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24444982"],"pmid":"24444982","pubdate":"2014-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Changes in macrominerals, trace elements and pigments content during lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) growth: Influence of soil composition.","type":"article","volume":"152C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/changes-macrominerals-trace-elements-pigments-content-during-lettuce-lactuca-sativa-l-growth-influen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629660,"mean":4.9331369641107,"rank":2900527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629660,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109797,"mean":7.1519768479729,"rank":85705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109797,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1621,"mean":2.927062962963,"rank":1135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1621,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":1.6546875,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
