Neutron scattering cross sections observed for (MEA)0.11(D2O)0.89, (MEA)0.11(D2O)0.89(CO2)0.06, and (MEA)0.11(D2O)0.89(DCl)0.11 solutions with different (14)N\/(15)N ratios were used to derive the first-order difference function, \u0394N(Q), which involves environmental structural information around the nitrogen atom of the MEA molecule. Intramolecular geometry and intermolecular hydration structure of MEA, protonated MEA (MEAD(+)), and MEA carbamate (MEA-CO2) molecules were obtained through the least-squares fitting of the observed \u0394(N)(Q) in the high-Q region and the intermolecular difference function, \u0394(N)(inter)(Q), respectively. In the aqueous solution, the MEA molecule takes the gauche conformation (dihedral angle, \u2220NCCO = 45 \u00b1 3\u00b0), suggesting that an intramolecular hydrogen bond is formed. On the other hand, values of the dihedral angle \u2220NCCO determined for MEAD(+) and MEA-CO2 molecules were 193 \u00b1 4\u00b0 and 214 \u00b1 8\u00b0, respectively. These results imply that the intermolecular hydrogen bonds are dominated for MEAD(+) and MEA-CO2 molecules. The intermolecular nearest neighbor N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(D2O) distance for the MEA molecule was determined to be 3.13 \u00b1 0.01 \u00c5, which suggests weak intermolecular interaction between the amino-nitrogen atom of MEA and water molecules in the first hydration shell. The nearest-neighbor N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(D2O) distances for MEAD(+) and MEA-CO2 molecules, 2.79 \u00b1 0.03 and 2.87 \u00b1 0.04 \u00c5, clearly indicate strong hydrogen bonds are formed among the amino group of these molecules and neighboring water molecules.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec5","authors":["Yasuo Kameda"],"doi":"10.1021\/jp411780d","first_seen_on":"2014-01-23T23:53:14+00:00","issns":["1520-6106"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry B","last_mentioned_on":1390521186,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jp411780d"],"pmid":"24417510","pubdate":"2014-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Hydration Structure of CO2-Absorbed 2-Aminoethanol Studied by Neutron Diffraction with the 14N\/15N Isotopic Substitution Method","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hydration-structure-co2absorbed-2aminoethanol-studied-neutron-diffraction-14n15n-isotopic-substituti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628824,"mean":4.9380564480592,"rank":2901981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628824,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109744,"mean":7.1590875408912,"rank":85723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109744,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1934,"mean":1.4990398344542,"rank":1019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1934,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176,"mean":1.7923428571429,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
