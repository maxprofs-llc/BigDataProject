The actin cytoskeleton is critical for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, yet we lack a mechanistic understanding of its interaction with the endocytic process and how it may be regulated. Here we show that F-actin in dendritic spines physically binds the synaptic nuclear envelope 1 gene product candidate plasticity gene 2 (CPG2) in a PKA-dependent manner, and that this association is required for synaptic GluR internalization. Mutating two PKA sites on CPG2 disrupts its cytoskeletal association, attenuating GluR endocytosis and affecting the efficacy of synaptic transmission in vivo. These results identify CPG2 as an F-actin binding partner that functionally mediates interaction of the spine cytoskeleton with postsynaptic endocytosis. Further, the regulation of CPG2\/F-actin association by PKA provides a gateway for cellular control of synaptic receptor internalization through second messenger signaling pathways. Recent identification of human synaptic nuclear envelope 1 as a risk locus for bipolar disorder suggests that CPG2 could play a role in synaptic dysfunction underlying neuropsychiatric disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Loebrich S","Djukic B","Tong ZJ","Cottrell JR","Turrigiano GG","Nedivi E"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1318860110","first_seen_on":"2014-01-23T13:34:44+00:00","issns":["0027-8424"],"issue":"","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1390483992,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24191017?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24191017","pubdate":"2013-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Regulation of glutamate receptor internalization by the spine cytoskeleton is mediated by its PKA-dependent association with CPG2.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regulation-glutamate-receptor-internalization-spine-cytoskeleton-mediated-pkadependent-association-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3624912,"mean":4.9388872667219,"rank":2906952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":72737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3624912,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109408,"mean":7.1348284113449,"rank":85641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109408,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33568,"mean":13.679309262073,"rank":30349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33568,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":911,"mean":31.282046153846,"rank":799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":911,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
