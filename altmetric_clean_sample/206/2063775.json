In recent years significant advances have been made in delineating the prominent role of TWEAK-Fn14 dyad in regulating skeletal muscle mass and metabolism. Also emerging from the broad study of tissue injury in skeletal muscle and other organs is the role of the TWEAK-Fn14 pathway in promoting fibrosis. This review article highlights recent advancements toward understanding how the TWEAK-Fn14 pathway regulates the response to various skeletal muscle insults and, more broadly, engages multiple mechanisms to drive tissue fibrosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c5","authors":["Marjan M Tajrishi","Timothy S Zheng","Linda C Burkly","Ashok Kumar"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cytogfr.2013.12.004","first_seen_on":"2014-01-22T15:40:13+00:00","funders":["niams"],"issns":["1879-0305"],"journal":"Cytokine & Growth Factor Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1443014706,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24444596","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24444596\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24444596?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24444596","pubdate":"2013-12-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"The TWEAK-Fn14 pathway: A potent regulator of skeletal muscle biology in health and disease.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tweakfn14-pathway-potent-regulator-skeletal-muscle-biology-health-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6392643,"mean":5.8550394828937,"rank":1385560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":4980985,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6392643,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148675,"mean":8.0175990825566,"rank":39397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":108609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148675,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220,"mean":1.6494063926941,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.3125,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
