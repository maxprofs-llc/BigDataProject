The reaction favors the C-H bonds of methyl groups over the methylene C-H bonds and tolerates various functional groups. Moreover, this reaction shows a predominant preference for sp(3) C-H bonds of methyl groups via a five-membered ring intermediate over the sp(2) C-H bonds of arenes in the cyclometalation step.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Xuesong Wu","Yan Zhao","Haibo Ge"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja413131m","first_seen_on":"2014-01-22T02:38:17+00:00","issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1390358272,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja413131m"],"pmid":"24446698","pubdate":"2014-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"140114173533006","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Nickel-Catalyzed Site-Selective Alkylation of Unactivated C(sp3)\u2212H Bonds","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nickelcatalyzed-siteselective-alkylation-unactivated-csp-sup3sup-h-bonds"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3565667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122226,"mean":7.7940150542036,"rank":94914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":832,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122226,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15478,"mean":4.1015412547651,"rank":12503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":1180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15478,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":498,"mean":4.9623863179074,"rank":408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":498,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
