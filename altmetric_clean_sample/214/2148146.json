We used a shotgun metagenomics approach to investigate the taxonomic and functional diversities of microbial communities in the bulk soil and in the rhizosphere of soybean plants and tested the validity of neutral and niche theories to explain the rhizosphere community assembly processes. Our results showed a clear selection at both taxonomic and functional levels operating in the assembly of the soybean rhizosphere community. The taxonomic analysis revealed that the rhizosphere community is a subset of the bulk soil community. Species abundance in rhizosphere fits the log-normal distribution model, which is an indicator of the occurrence of niche-based processes. In addition, the data indicate that the rhizosphere community is selected based on functional cores related to the metabolisms of nitrogen, iron, phosphorus and potassium, which are related to benefits to the plant, such as growth promotion and nutrition. The network analysis including bacterial groups and functions was less complex in rhizosphere, suggesting the specialization of some specific metabolic pathways. We conclude that the assembly of the microbial community in the rhizosphere is based on niche-based processes as a result of the selection power of the plant and other environmental factors.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 20 February 2014; doi:10.1038\/ismej.2014.17.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f18","authors":["Lucas W Mendes","Eiko E Kuramae","Ac|[aacute]|cio A Navarrete","Johannes A van Veen","Siu M Tsai"],"doi":"10.1038\/ismej.2014.17","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2014-02-26T21:51:17+00:00","issns":["1751-7362","1751-7370"],"journal":"ISME Journal: Multidisciplinary Journal of Microbial Ecology","last_mentioned_on":1393451467,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ismej\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ismej201417a.html?WT.mc_id=TWT_ISMEJ"],"pmid":"24553468","pubdate":"2014-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["environmentalhealth","microbiology"],"title":"Taxonomical and functional microbial community selection in soybean rhizosphere","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/taxonomical-functional-microbial-community-selection-soybean-rhizosphere"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3082600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":964922,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108757,"mean":8.3593077347459,"rank":74097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":23050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108757,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1124,"mean":7.9442867319679,"rank":1048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1124,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":9.2689705882353,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":6,"Professor > Associate Professor":11,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":22,"Researcher":57,"Student  > Ph.
