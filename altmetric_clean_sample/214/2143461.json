However, the effect of HCV genotype 3 on cirrhosis and HCC risk is uncertain. We identified patients with active HCV infection, confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a known HCV genotype, from the VA HCV Clinical Case Registry between 2000 and 2009. We examined the effect of HCV genotype on the risk of cirrhosis and HCC in a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for patients' age, period of service (World War I\/II, Vietnam era, post-Vietnam era), race, gender, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, alcohol use, diabetes, body mass index, and antiviral treatment receipt. Of the 110,484 patients with active HCV viremia, 88,348 (79.9%) had genotype 1, 13,077 (11.8%) genotype 2, 8,337 (7.5%) genotype 3, and 1,082 (0.9%) patients had genotype 4 infection. Despite being younger, patients with genotype 3 had a higher risk of developing cirrhosis (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR]\u2009= 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009= 1.32-1.50) and HCC (unadjusted HR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.48-1.85) than HCV genotype 1 patients. After adjustment for prespecified demographic, clinical, and antiviral treatment factors, the risk of cirrhosis and HCC was 31% (adjusted HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.22-1.39) and 80% (adjusted HR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.61-2.03) higher in patients with genotype 3 compared to genotype 1 infected patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f610007619","authors":["Kanwal, Fasiha","Kramer, Jennifer R.","Ilyas, Jawad","Duan, Zhigang","El\u2010Serag, Hashem B."],"doi":"10.1002\/hep.27095","endpage":"105","first_seen_on":"2014-02-25T03:31:33+00:00","funders":["niaid","nci"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1527-3350","0270-9139","02709139"],"issue":"1","journal":"Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1474588800,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/hep.27095\/abstract;jsessionid=5C06C0D642B1889E557E5E5A3CEA18EA.f03t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/hep.27095\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/hep.27095\/abstract;jsessionid=4FDFC9CC644BAA8808763327AAD8000C.f01t01","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24615981?dopt=Citation","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/hep.27095\/abstract;jsessionid=E52A827D6CCC0818BA1DA55BF4614048.f02t01","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/hep.27095"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/hep.27095\/pdf","pmid":"24615981","pubdate":"2014-05-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"98","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"HCV genotype 3 is associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer in a national sample of U.S. Veterans with HCV","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hcv-genotype-3-associated-increased-risk-cirrhosis-hepatocellular-cancer-national-sample-veterans-hc-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":20.498,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":20.498},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":435697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7983187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177864,"mean":7.9443685420803,"rank":11769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":166095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177864,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4347,"mean":6.1271725724804,"rank":179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":4168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4347,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":3.299875,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":77,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
