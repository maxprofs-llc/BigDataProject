Mounting evidence supports the argument that a high level of population immunity must be maintained after wild poliovirus circulation is stopped to preserve a polio-free status worldwide. Shifting factors in the risk-benefit-cost equation favor the creation of new poliovirus vaccines for use in the foreseeable future. Genetically stable attenuated virus strains could be developed for an improved oral poliovirus vaccine, but proving their safety and efficacy would be impractical owing to the enormous size of the clinical trials required. Novel versions of inactivated poliovirus vaccine that could be used globally should be developed. An improved inactivated poliovirus vaccine must be efficacious, inexpensive, safe to manufacture and easy to administer. Combination products containing inactivated poliovirus vaccine and other protective antigens should become part of routine childhood immunizations around the world.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073db","authors":["Ehrenfeld E","Modlin J","Chumakov K"],"doi":"10.1586\/erv.09.49","first_seen_on":"2014-02-24T19:57:51+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Expert Review of Vaccines","last_mentioned_on":1393228284,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19545205"],"pmid":"19545205","pubdate":"2009-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Future of polio vaccines.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/future-polio-vaccines"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9199431259457,"rank":2017838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97757,"mean":7.3969087933223,"rank":50524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":26038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97757,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318,"mean":2.147167192429,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":3.2454545454545,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
