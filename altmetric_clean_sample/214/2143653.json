These doped nanocrystals, mainly self-doped semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) and extrinsically-doped metal oxide NCs, have extremely high concentrations of free charge carriers, which allows them to exhibit LSPR at near infrared (NIR) wavelengths. In this tutorial review, we discuss recent progress in developing and synthesizing doped semiconductor and metal oxide nanocrystals with LSPR, and in studying the optical properties of these plasmonic nanocrystals. We go on to discuss their growing potential for advancing biomedical and optoelectronic applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ee","authors":["Xin Liu","Mark T.
