Shift change handovers (SCHs) are being reduced or eliminated in France to reduce staff costs. The objective of our study is to clarify the consequences of short SCHs on efficiency, team function, and quality of care.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dc8","authors":["Estryn-Behar, Madeleine R.","Milanini-Magny, Giuliana","Chaumon, Elise","Deslandes, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne","Fry, Clementine","Garcia, Frederic","Ravache, Anne-Emilie"],"doi":"10.1097\/pts.0000000000000066","first_seen_on":"2014-02-27T03:16:23+00:00","issns":["1549-8417"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Patient Safety","last_mentioned_on":1393457367,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/journalpatientsafety\/Abstract\/2014\/03000\/Shift_Change_Handovers_and_Subsequent.5.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/journalpatientsafety\/2014\/03000\/Shift_Change_Handovers_and_Subsequent.5.pdf","pmid":"24553442","pubdate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"29","subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Shift Change Handovers and Subsequent Interruptions: Potential Impacts on Quality of Care","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/journalpatientsafety\/Fulltext\/2014\/03000\/Shift_Change_Handovers_and_Subsequent.5.aspx","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shift-change-handovers-subsequent-interruptions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228670,"mean":5.9649392979483,"rank":4606289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228670,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132022,"mean":8.6677885487916,"rank":88695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":23766,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132022,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":331,"mean":10.776727272727,"rank":286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":331,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":5.91,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
