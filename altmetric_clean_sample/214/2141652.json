Because of its association with hemorrhagic shock and predisposition to disseminated coagulopathy, it is a leading cause of maternal deaths worldwide. Furthermore, the jeopardy of PPH is rising with the secondary form of PPH occurring between 24 hours and 6 weeks postpartum, when women are already discharged home. The causes of this pathology are severe inflammation (endometritis), inherited coagulation disorders, consumptive coagulopathy, and retained products of conceptions. Others are of rare occurrence, such as vessel subinvolution (VSI) of the placental implantation site, uterine artery pseudoaneurysm, or trauma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d5","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2393-14-80","first_seen_on":"2014-02-24T18:30:53+00:00","issns":["1471-2393"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth","last_mentioned_on":1393266649,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2393\/14\/80\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2393-14-80.pdf","pmid":"24558972","pubdate":"2014-02-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Gynecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Maternal and Child Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"80","subjects":["obstetrics"],"title":"Recurrent secondary postpartum hemorrhages due to placental site vessel subinvolution and local uterine tissue coagulopathy","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recurrent-secondary-postpartum-hemorrhages-due-placental-site-vessel-subinvolution-local-uterine-tis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3061133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":940546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110329,"mean":8.3232826299764,"rank":74082,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":23196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110329,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1124,"mean":4.8500053428317,"rank":941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1124,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":7.8628376068376,"rank":105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Social Sciences":2,"Psychology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IE":1},"mendeley":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UCCMidwifery\/status\/438018193194352641","license":"public","citation_ids":[2141652],"posted_on":"2014-02-24T18:30:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Rhona O'Connell","url":"http:\/\/www.ucc.ie\/en\/nursingmidwifery\/\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2363464959\/vp8l3umj9xq4gb9xr704_normal.jpeg","description":"Offering midwifery education programmes and sharing information that midwives may be interested in","id_on_source":"UCCMidwifery","tweeter_id":"613445712","geo":{"lt":51.89797,"ln":-8.47061,"country":"IE"},"followers":998},"tweet_id":"438018193194352641"}]}}
