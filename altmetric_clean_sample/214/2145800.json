An experimenter hid food under one of two bowls and after baiting, indicated the location of the food to the subjects by using one of four different cues. Horses could locate the hidden reward on the basis of the distal dynamic-sustained, proximal momentary and proximal dynamic-sustained pointing gestures but failed to perform above chance level when the experimenter performed a distal momentary pointing gesture. The results revealed that horses could rely spontaneously on those cues that could have a stimulus or local enhancement effect, but the possible comprehension of the distal momentary pointing remained unclear. The results are discussed with reference to the involvement of various factors such as predisposition to read human visual cues, the effect of domestication and extensive social experience and the nature of the gesture used by the experimenter in comparative investigations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002259","authors":["Katalin Maros","M\u00e1rta G\u00e1csi","\u00c1d\u00e1m Mikl\u00f3si"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10071-008-0136-5","first_seen_on":"2014-02-26T01:29:46+00:00","issns":["1435-9456","1435-9448"],"issue":"3","journal":"Animal Cognition","last_mentioned_on":1393519448,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10071-008-0136-5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10071-008-0136-5.pdf","pmid":"18247069","pubdate":"2008-02-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Behavioural Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Comprehension of human pointing gestures in horses (Equus caballus)","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comprehension-human-pointing-gestures-horses-equus-caballus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1689261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":2793889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108765,"mean":8.3627121290135,"rank":35397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":72433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108765,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":516,"mean":13.039891262136,"rank":316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":516,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":14.427333333333,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":28,"Student  > Ph.
