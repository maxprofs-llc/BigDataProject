By using this protocol a variety of symmetrical and unsymmetrical triarylmethanes were synthesized. As an application of the newly developed methodology, we demonstrate a high-yielding synthesis of the triarylmethane intermediate towards an anti-breast-cancer drug candidate.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007df","authors":["Rao, H Surya Prakash","Rao, A Veera Bhadra"],"doi":"10.3762\/bjoc.12.49","endpage":"504","first_seen_on":"2016-06-25T13:12:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1860-5397"],"journal":"Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1466850290,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27340442?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4902010","pmid":"27340442","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"496","title":"Copper-mediated arylation with arylboronic acids: Facile and modular synthesis of triarylmethanes","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coppermediated-arylation-arylboronic-acids-facile-modular-synthesis-triarylmethanes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7942916,"mean":6.7127945609325,"rank":6874616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7942916,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261771,"mean":11.539164411506,"rank":219367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261771,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268,"mean":2.4679400749064,"rank":211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.8722222222222,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
