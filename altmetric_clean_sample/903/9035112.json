Recent genetic and molecular characterization of these tumors using sophisticated genomics techniques, including next-generation sequencing experiments, has revealed multiple areas that can be exploited for new molecularly targeted therapies for this disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e92","authors":["Shern, Jack F","Yohe, Marielle E","Khan, Javed"],"first_seen_on":"2016-06-25T14:14:41+00:00","issns":["0893-9675"],"issue":"3-4","journal":"Critical Reviews\u0099 in Oncogenesis","last_mentioned_on":1466854570,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26349418?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26349418","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Pediatric Rhabdomyosarcoma.","type":"article","volume":"20"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7942916,"mean":6.7127945609325,"rank":6874620,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7942916,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261771,"mean":11.539134232341,"rank":219362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261771,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":1.5714285714286,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/statuses\/746668304798887936","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9035112],"posted_on":"2016-06-25T11:36:10+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
