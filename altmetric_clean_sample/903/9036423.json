Many are supported by laboratory based efficacy studies. Future research should investigate optimal ages for particular treatments, as well as, the effectiveness of treatments across different social settings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a9","authors":["Shaw, Dorothy R","Shaw, Dorothy R."],"doi":"10.3233\/nre-161343","endpage":"123","first_seen_on":"2016-06-25T15:56:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-6448","1053-8135","18786448"],"issue":"1","journal":"NeuroRehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1469025360,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27341366?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/content.iospress.com\/articles\/neurorehabilitation\/nre1343"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/content.iospress.com\/download\/neurorehabilitation\/nre1343?id=neurorehabilitation%2Fnre1343","pmid":"27341366","pubdate":"2016-06-25T22:00:15+00:00","publisher":"IOS Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"119","subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine","neurology"],"title":"A systematic review of pediatric cognitive rehabilitation in the elementary and middle school systems.","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-review-pediatric-cognitive-rehabilitation-elementary-middle-school-systems"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085102,"mean":6.8782317593723,"rank":890561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7182874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085102,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262908,"mean":11.631910538707,"rank":41882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":220161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262908,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":417,"mean":3.6608317307692,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":417,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":3.1602564102564,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
