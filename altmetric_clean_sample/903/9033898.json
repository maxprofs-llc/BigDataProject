Data were obtained from a prospectively maintained database. Late relapse was defined as tumour recurrence > 2 years after orchiectomy.\nOverall, 1060 stage I seminoma patients were managed with active surveillance (n=766) or adjuvant radiotherapy (n=294). At a median follow-up of 10.6 years (range 1.2-30), 142 patients relapsed at a median (range) of 14 (3-129) months; 128 on active surveillance and 14 after adjuvant radiotherapy. The late relapse rate for the active surveillance and adjuvant radiotherapy groups was 4% and 1%, respectively. There was no specific clinicopathological factor associated with late relapse. Isolated para-aortic node(s) was the most common relapse site in active surveillance patients either in late (88%) or early relapse (82%). Among the active surveillance group, no patients with late relapse subsequently developed a second relapse after either salvage radiotherapy (n=25) or chemotherapy (n=6), whereas in early relapse patients a second relapse was reported in seven (10%) of 72 patients treated with salvage radiotherapy and one (4%) of 23 patients who received chemotherapy; all second relapses were subsequently salvaged with chemotherapy. No patient in the adjuvant radiotherapy group developed a second relapse after salvage chemotherapy (n=10) or inguinal radiotherapy\/surgery (n=4). Of seven deaths, only one was related to seminoma. Among active surveillance patients, the 10 year overall survival for late and early relapse groups were 100% and 96% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.2), whereas the 10 year cancer-specific survival rates were 100% and 99% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.3), respectively.\nIn stage I seminoma, the extent and pattern of late relapse is similar to that for early relapse. For active surveillance patients, selective use of salvage radiotherapy\/chemotherapy for relapse results in excellent outcomes regardless of the timing of relapse, whereas salvage radiotherapy for late relapse seems to be associated with a minimal risk of second relapse.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000256a","authors":["Hosni, A","Warde, P","Jewett, M","Bedard, P","Hamilton, R","Moore, M","Nayan, M","Huang, R","Atenafu, E G","O'Malley, M","Sweet, J","Chung, P"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.clon.2016.06.001","endpage":"654","first_seen_on":"2016-06-25T13:09:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1433-2981","09366555"],"issue":"10","journal":"Clinical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1475194411,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27339401?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0936655516301194&_version=1&md5=d1b6a3ba782150b90957ea0c98d14b14"],"pmid":"27339401","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"648","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Late Relapse in Stage I Testicular Seminoma","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-characteristics-outcomes-late-relapse-stage-i-testicular-seminoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":6414683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1149457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265936,"mean":11.732706450824,"rank":184616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":46413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265936,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":726,"mean":3.989955862069,"rank":407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":726,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.9777777777778,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/746649161362137089","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9033898],"posted_on":"2016-06-25T10:20:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":727},"tweet_id":"746649161362137089"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/medphyspapers\/statuses\/781648130056065024","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9033898],"posted_on":"2016-09-30T00:13:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Med Phys Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"New publications in Medical Physics and Radiotherapy.","id_on_source":"medphyspapers","tweeter_id":"2879791906","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":136},"tweet_id":"781648130056065024"}]}}
