In barley, more than 13 HvCBF genes map coincident with the major QTL FR-H2 suggesting them as candidates to explain the function of the locus. Variation in copy number (CNV) of specific HvCBFs was assayed in a panel of 41 barley genotypes using RT-qPCR. Taking advantage of an accurate phenotyping that combined Fv\/Fm and field survival, resistance-associated variants within FR-H2 were identified. Genotypes with an increased copy number of HvCBF4 and HvCBF2 (at least ten and eight copies, respectively) showed greater frost resistance. A CAPS marker able to distinguish the CBF2A, CBF2B and CBF2A\/B forms was developed and showed that all the higher-ranking genotypes in term of resistance harbour only CBF2A, while other resistant winter genotypes harbour also CBF2B, although at a lower CNV. In addition to the major involvement of the HvCBF4-HvCBF2 genomic segment in the proximal cluster of CBF elements, a negative role of HvCBF3 in the distal cluster was identified. Multiple linear regression models taking into account allelic variation at FR-H1\/VRN-H1 explained 0.434 and 0.550 (both at p\u2009<\u20090.001) of the phenotypic variation for Fv\/Fm and field survival respectively, while no interaction effect between CNV at the HvCBFs and FR-H1\/VRN-H1 was found. Altogether our data suggest a major involvement of the CBF genes located in the proximal cluster, with no apparent involvement of the central cluster contrary to what was reported for wheat.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008542","authors":["Francia, Enrico","Morcia, Caterina","Pasquariello, Marianna","Mazzamurro, Valentina","Milc, Justyna Anna","Rizza, Fulvia","Terzi, Valeria","Pecchioni, Nicola"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11103-016-0505-4","first_seen_on":"2016-06-25T13:57:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-5028","0167-4412"],"journal":"Plant Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1467038447,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27338258?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27338258"],"pmid":"27338258","pubdate":"2016-06-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Pathology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","botany"],"title":"Copy number variation at the HvCBF4\u2013HvCBF2 genomic segment is a major component of frost resistance in barley","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/copy-number-variation-hvcbf4hvcbf2-genomic-segment-major-component-frost-resistance-barley"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7953275,"mean":6.7183323059095,"rank":3671138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4250231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7953275,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261862,"mean":11.539951073279,"rank":117188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":142923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261862,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":624,"mean":2.2657367576244,"rank":301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":624,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.134375,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
