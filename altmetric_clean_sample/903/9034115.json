There is evidence that bone marrow-derived CXCR4-expressing cells contribute to intimal hyperplasia (IH) by homing to the arterial subintima which is enriched with SDF-1\u03b1. We have previously found that transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) and its signaling protein Smad3 are both up-regulated following arterial injury and that TGF\u03b2\/Smad3 enhances the expression of CXCR4 in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). It remains unknown, however, whether locally induced CXCR4 expression in SM22 expressing vascular SMCs plays a role in neointima formation.\nTo investigate whether elevated TGF\u03b2\/Smad3 signaling leads to the induction of CXCR4 expression locally in the injured arterial wall, thereby contributing to IH.\nWe found prominent CXCR4 up-regulation (mRNA, 60 fold; protein, 4 fold) in TGF\u03b2-treated, Smad3-expressing SMCs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed a specific association of the transcription factor Smad3 with the CXCR4 promoter. TGF\u03b2\/Smad3 treatment also markedly enhanced SDF-1\u03b1-induced ERK1\/2 phosphorylation as well as SMC migration in a CXCR4-dependent manner. Adenoviral expression of Smad3 in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries increased local CXCR4 levels and enhanced IH, whereas SMC-specific depletion of CXCR4 in the wire-injured mouse femoral arterial wall produced a 60% reduction in IH.\nOur results provide the first evidence that up-regulation of TGF\u03b2\/Smad3 in injured arteries induces local SMC CXCR4 expression and cell migration, and consequently IH. The Smad3\/CXCR4 pathway may provide a potential target for therapeutic interventions to prevent restenosis. This article is protected by copyright.
