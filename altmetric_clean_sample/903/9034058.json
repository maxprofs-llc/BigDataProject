The study used an anonymous questionnaire and Quick Exposure Check.\nThe most common musculoskeletal complaints were as follows: 70 physiotherapists (64.8% ) reported low back pain, 60 (55.6% ) cervical pain, and 34 (31.5% ) pain in the wrists and fingers. Statistically significant positive correlations were revealed between the number of years worked in the profession and shoulder pain. The number of hours of work per week was positively correlated with the occurrence of pain in all analyzed body areas. Professional experience was negatively correlated with the level of stress felt. Physiotherapists dealing with manual therapy and exercise physiotherapy were particularly vulnerable to musculoskeletal overload.\nPopularization of knowledge regarding ergonomics among physiotherapists could reduce the occurrence of musculoskeletal overload.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5683cf058f610004ae1","authors":["Truszczy\u0144ska, Aleksandra","Scherer, Anna","Drza\u0142-Grabiec, Justyna"],"doi":"10.3233\/wor-162343","first_seen_on":"2016-06-25T13:15:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1875-9270"],"issue":"3","journal":"Work","last_mentioned_on":1466850441,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27341517?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27341517","pubdate":"2016-06-25T22:00:12+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["occupationalmedicine"],"title":"The occurrence of overload at work and\u00a0musculoskeletal pain in young physiotherapists.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/occurrence-overload-work-musculoskeletal-pain-young-physiotherapists"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7942916,"mean":6.7127945609325,"rank":6021913,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1068320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7942916,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261770,"mean":11.539203717781,"rank":183519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261770,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":418,"mean":3.8951558752998,"rank":293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":418,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.83333333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
