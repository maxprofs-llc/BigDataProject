Neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (NAIs) are the only class of drugs available to treat influenza A and B virus infections, so development of NAI-resistant viruses with superior fitness is a public health concern. Fitness of NAI-resistant influenza B viruses is not widely studied. Here we examined the replicative capacity and relative fitness in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells of recombinant (rg) influenza B\/Yamanashi\/166\/1998 viruses containing a single amino acid substitution in NA that is associated with NAI-resistance. Replication in NHBE cells of viruses with reduced inhibition by oseltamivir (rg-E119A, rg-D198E, rg-I222T, rg-H274Y, rg-N294S, and rg-R371K, N2 numbering) or zanamivir (rg-E119A and rg-R371K) failed to be inhibited by the presence of the respective NAI. In a fluorescence-based assay, detection of rg-E119A was easily masked by the presence of NAI-susceptible virus. We co-infected NHBE cells with NAI-susceptible and -resistant viruses and used next-generation deep-sequencing to reveal the order of relative fitness -compared to that of wild-type (WT) virus: rg-H274Y > rg-WT > rg-I222T > rg-N294S > rg-D198E > rg-E119A > rg-R371K. Based on the lack of attenuated replication of rg-E119A in NHBE cells in the presence of oseltamivir or zanamivir, and the fitness advantage of rg-H274Y over rg-WT, we emphasize the importance of these substitutions in the NA glycoprotein. Human infections with influenza B viruses carrying E119A or H274Y substitutions could limit therapeutic options for those infected; emergence of such viruses should be closely monitored.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Andrew J.
