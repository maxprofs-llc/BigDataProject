To decrease the vector dose, we explored AAV-8 (1-3 \u00d7 10(12) vg\/kg) encoding a hyperfunctional factor IX (FIX-Padua, arginine 338 to leucine) in FIX inhibitor-prone HB dogs. Two na\u00efve HB dogs showed sustained expression of FIX-Padua with an 8- to 12-fold increased specific activity reaching 25% to 40% activity without antibody formation to FIX. A third dog with preexisting FIX inhibitors exhibited a transient anamnestic response (5 Bethesda units) at 2 weeks after vector delivery following by spontaneous eradication of the antibody to FIX by day 70. In this dog, sustained FIX expression reached \u223c200% and 30% of activity and antigen levels, respectively. Immune tolerance was confirmed in all dogs after challenges with plasma-derived FIX concentrate. Shortening of the clotting times and lack of bleeding episodes support the phenotypic correction of the severe phenotype, with no clinical or laboratory evidence of risk of thrombosis. Provocative studies in mice showed that FIX-Padua exhibits similar immunogenicity and thrombogenicity compared with FIX wild type. Collectively, these data support the potential translation of gene-based strategies using FIX-Padua for HB.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Julie M.
