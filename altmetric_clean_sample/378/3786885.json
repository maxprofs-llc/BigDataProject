The error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related potential (ERP) component, is a well-validated neural response to errors and reflects the error monitoring activity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Additionally, the ERN is implicated in several processes key to adaptive functioning. Abnormalities in error-related brain activity have been linked to multiple forms of psychopathology and individual differences. As such, the component is likely to be useful in NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative to establish biologically-meaningful dimensions of psychological dysfunction, and currently appears as a unit of measurement in three RDoC domains: Positive Valence Systems, Negative Valence Systems, and Cognitive Systems. In this review paper, we introduce the ERN and discuss evidence related to its psychometric properties, as well as important task differences. Following this, we discuss evidence linking the ERN to clinically diverse forms of psychopathology, as well as the implications of one unit of measurement appearing in multiple RDoC dimensions. And finally, we discuss important future directions, as well as research pathways by which the ERN might be leveraged to track the ways in which dysfunction of multiple neural systems interact to influence psychological well-being.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b92","doi":"10.1016\/j.ijpsycho.2015.02.029","first_seen_on":"2015-03-14T03:14:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01678760"],"journal":"International Journal of Psychophysiology","last_mentioned_on":1426302867,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0167876015001063"],"pmid":"25746725","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"title":"Error-related brain activity in the age of RDoC: A review of the literature ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/errorrelated-brain-activity-age-rdoc-review-literature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4868490,"mean":5.7954838530026,"rank":4073122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4868490,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146187,"mean":10.174335189416,"rank":121710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146187,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":503,"mean":3.7777330677291,"rank":428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":503,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.5675,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
