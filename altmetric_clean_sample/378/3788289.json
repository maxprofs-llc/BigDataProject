The catalyst composed of palladium and dicyclohexyl(dihydroxyterphenyl)phosphine (Cy-DHTP) enabled ortho-selective Sonogashira coupling, and subsequent cyclization afforded 4-chloroindoles in high yields. This transformation was successfully applied to the one-pot synthesis of 2,4-disubstituted indoles via Suzuki-Miyaura coupling after indole formation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Miyuki Yamaguchi"],"doi":"10.1021\/ol500711z","first_seen_on":"2015-03-14T21:06:39+00:00","issns":["1523-7060"],"journal":"Organic Letters","last_mentioned_on":1397746124,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ol500711z"],"pmid":"24742051","pubdate":"2014-04-20T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"One-Pot Synthesis of 2,4-Disubstituted Indoles from N-Tosyl-2,3-dichloroaniline Using Palladium\u2013Dihydroxyterphenylphosphine Catalyst","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/onepot-synthesis-24disubstituted-indoles-ntosyl23-dichloroaniline-using-palladiumdihydroxyterphenylp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3669021,"mean":4.9498187178088,"rank":2934165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3669021,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86430,"mean":8.8734552291477,"rank":70967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86430,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2370,"mean":3.4694993668214,"rank":1879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2370,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":2.0365151515152,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
