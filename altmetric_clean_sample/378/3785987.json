These tumors are known to occur in soft tissues and bones in various sites. It is very unusual however, for OITs to occur intracranially, with only 10 reported intracranial cases since the discovery of this entity in 1959. The most common intracrainal OITs are phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors (PMT) and Haemangiopericytomas (HCT). In this paper we report a case of hypophosphatemic osteomalacia caused by a tumor in the right anterior cranial fossa. We also hypothesize, based on our review of the literature, that this entity is under diagnosed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d13","authors":["Fathalla H","Cusimano M","Di Ieva A","Karamchandani J","Fung R","Kovacs K"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.wneu.2015.02.030","first_seen_on":"2015-03-13T19:48:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"World Neurosurgery","last_mentioned_on":1426276090,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25746588?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25746588","pubdate":"2015-03-10T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"Osteomalacia Inducing Tumors of the Brain; a case report, review and a hypothesis.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/osteomalaciainducing-tumors-brain-case-report-review-hypothesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4866634,"mean":5.7962712002345,"rank":4071940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4866634,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146263,"mean":10.188058921661,"rank":121693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146263,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":510,"mean":1.965115913556,"rank":353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":510,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.84444444444444,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
