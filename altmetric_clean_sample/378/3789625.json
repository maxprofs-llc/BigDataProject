Recently, the rapid increase of scrub typhus incidence in several countries within the endemic region has become a serious public health issue. Despite the wide range of preventative approaches that have been attempted in the past 70 years, all have failed to develop an effective prophylactic vaccine. Currently, the selection of the proper antigens is one of the critical barriers to generating cross-protective immunity against antigenically-variable strains of O. tsutsugamushi.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e2","authors":["Na-Young Ha","Prashant Sharma","Gwanghun Kim","Yuri Kim","Chan-Ki Min","Myung-Sik Choi","Ik-Sang Kim","Nam-Hyuk Cho"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pntd.0003585","first_seen_on":"2015-03-15T10:04:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1935-2735"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1426413847,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25768004?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25768004","pubdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Immunization with an Autotransporter Protein of Orientia tsutsugamushi Provides Protective Immunity against Scrub Typhus.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunization-autotransporter-protein-orientia-tsutsugamushi-provides-protective-immunity-against-scr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4869733,"mean":5.7965197477024,"rank":2583699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1627080,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4869733,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146341,"mean":10.194997375974,"rank":83299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":46974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146341,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3100,"mean":7.7466640851888,"rank":2129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3100,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220,"mean":6.8305296803653,"rank":154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
