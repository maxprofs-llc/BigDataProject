Such a tool could greatly improve patient survival by identifying the most appropriate treatment on a patient-specific basis.\nPubMed was searched for studies predicting response or resistance to chemotherapy using gene expression measurements of human tissue in ovarian cancer.\n42 studies were identified and both the data collection and modelling methods were compared. The majority of studies utilised fresh-frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. Modelling techniques varied, the most popular being Cox proportional hazards regression and hierarchical clustering which were used by 17 and 11 studies respectively. The gene signatures identified by the various studies were not consistent, with very few genes being identified by more than two studies. Patient cohorts were often noted to be heterogeneous with respect to chemotherapy treatment undergone by patients.\nA clinically applicable gene signature capable of predicting patient response to chemotherapy has not yet been identified. Research into a predictive, as opposed to prognostic, model could be highly beneficial and aid the identification of the most suitable treatment for patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b0","authors":["Lloyd, Katherine L","Cree, Ian A","Savage, Richard S"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12885-015-1101-8","first_seen_on":"2015-03-12T22:12:43+00:00","funders":["niehs","mrc"],"issns":["1471-2407"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1426767676,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2407\/15\/117\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12885-015-1101-8.pdf","pmid":"25886033","pubdate":"2015-03-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"117","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Prediction of resistance to chemotherapy in ovarian cancer: a systematic review","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prediction-resistance-chemotherapy-ovarian-cancer-systematic-review-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4892609,"mean":5.819074268369,"rank":2176178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2663110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4892609,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146462,"mean":10.215327466015,"rank":65876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":78009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146462,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2757,"mean":2.29243904209,"rank":770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":1916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2757,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":4.24358,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
