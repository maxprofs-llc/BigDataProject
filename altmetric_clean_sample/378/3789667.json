Type I appears more frequently and in principle patients have a good prognosis; however a significant number of patients develop local recurrences. We hypothesize that TAG-72, expressed on endometrial carcinoma binds and internalizes endocytic pattern recognition receptors on surrounding tissue antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells and macrophages), powers their anti-inflammatory maturation program and make them capable to elicit or modulated tolerogenic immune response mediated by local T and NK effectors. This could support uncontrolled local tumor growth, deeper tumor invasion into surrounding tissues, frequent local recurrences and\/or lymph node metastasis. To test this hypothesis, we propose a semi-quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of TAG-72 expression in endometrial adenocarcinoma samples and to correlate the results with clinical and pathological parameters (age, type and histological grade of the tumor, estrogen and progesterone receptor expression, invasion into the myometrium and capillaries, presence of lymph node metastases, FIGO stage, and TNM classification). It would be worthwhile to investigate the local tissue immune response in the tumor environment using tissue samples removed during surgery. These studies could elucidate the underlying immunopathological mechanisms that govern the early recurrence and possibly distant metastases of TAG-72-expressing adenocarcinomas and might help in deciding the type of treatment to be applied in a selected group of cancer patients including application of biological therapy with anti-TAG-72 antibodies, according the principle of personalized oncology treatments.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008126","authors":["Ines Kristofic","Arnela Redzovic","Gordana Laskarin","Senija Eminovic","Herman Haller","Daniel Rukavina"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mehy.2014.10.017","first_seen_on":"2015-03-15T10:08:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-2777"],"journal":"Medical Hypotheses","last_mentioned_on":1426453024,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25769704?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25769704?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25769704","pubdate":"2014-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Role of tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 in the progression of endometrial adenocarcinoma: A proposed study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-tumorassociated-glycoprotein72-progression-endometrial-adenocarcinoma-proposed-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4869733,"mean":5.7965197477024,"rank":2414485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2308229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4869733,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146342,"mean":10.194922584922,"rank":75909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":63867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146342,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1691,"mean":5.4965656804734,"rank":914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1691,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":3.1434782608696,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
