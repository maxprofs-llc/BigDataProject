Current treatment options have relatively limited efficacy; therefore, novel targets need to be explored. The co-inhibitory molecule, B7x, a new member of the B7 family expressed predominantly by non-lymphoid tissues, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation, activation and functional responses of CD4 and CD8 T cells. In this study, we found that B7x was expressed by intrinsic renal cells, and was up-regulated upon stimulation with inflammatory triggers. After passive administration of antibodies against glomerular antigens, B7x(-\/-) mice developed severe renal injury accompanied by a robust adaptive immune response and kidney up-regulation of inflammatory mediators, as well as local infiltration of T cells and macrophages. Furthermore, macrophages in the spleen of B7x(-\/-) mice were polarized to an inflammatory phenotype. Finally, treatment with B7x-immunoglobulin (Ig) in this nephritis model decreased kidney damage and reduced local inflammation. We propose that B7x can modulate kidney damage in autoimmune diseases including lupus nephritis and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease. Thus, B7x mimetics may be a novel therapeutic option for treatment of immune-mediated kidney disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002548","authors":["Pawar RD","Goilav B","Xia Y","Herlitz L","Doerner J","Chalmers S","Ghosh K","Zang X","Putterman C"],"doi":"10.1111\/cei.12452","endpage":"343","first_seen_on":"2015-03-12T11:28:02+00:00","funders":["nci","niams"],"issns":["0009-9104"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical & Experimental Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1426159623,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25205493?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25205493","pubdate":"2014-09-11T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"329","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"B7x\/B7H-4 modulates the adaptive immune response and ameliorates renal injury in antibody mediated nephritis.","type":"article","volume":"179","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/b7xb7h4-modulates-adaptive-immune-response-ameliorates-renal-injury-antibodymediated-nephritis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4864474,"mean":5.7937841570951,"rank":4070060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4864474,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146152,"mean":10.211851865537,"rank":121594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146152,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1049,"mean":2.9108645038168,"rank":849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1049,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":3.5467741935484,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/status\/575981325317906432","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3780194],"posted_on":"2015-03-12T11:27:03+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
