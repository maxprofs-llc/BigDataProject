Now, we compared brain activation patterns between Thy1\u03b16 and wild-type mice to identify brain structures potentially mediating this anxiolytic response. Acutely efficient anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines typically depress most brain regions while activating specifically neurons within the central extended amygdala. Gaboxadol treatment (3 mg\/kg, i.p., 2 h) induced a significant increase in c-Fos expression selectively in many Thy1\u03b16 brain regions including the limbic cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus, septal area and central and basolateral nuclei of amygdala. It failed to activate the Thy1\u03b16 mediodorsal thalamic nucleus that was activated in the wild-type mice. Detailed mapping of the \u03b16 subunit mRNA by in situ hybridization revealed expression in the middle layers of isocortex, olfactory areas, hippocampal formation and basolateral nucleus of amygdala in the Thy1\u03b16 forebrain. The ligand autoradiographies ([(35)S]TBPS and [(3)H]Ro 15-4513) revealed high levels of pharmacologically active extrasynaptic \u03b16\u03b2 and \u03b16\u03b2\u03b32 GABAA receptors in these same areas. However, c-Fos induction by gaboxadol treatment in Thy1\u03b16 brain was not restricted to areas highly expressing the \u03b16-containing GABAA receptors suggesting that indirect pathways lead to the paradoxically widespread activation. Interestingly, the activation pattern by gaboxadol at the dose that is anxiolytic in Thy1\u03b16 mice resembled closely that observed after various fear- and stress-provoking challenges. However, our results are consistent with a recent observation that optogenetic activation of specific neuronal pathways in the extended amygdala mediates anxiolytic responses. Our results suggest that the widespread neuronal inhibition as typically associated with benzodiazepines is not the exclusive mechanism of anxiolysis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031aa","authors":["Kati S Hellsten","Anni-Maija Linden","Esa R Korpi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuroscience.2015.02.052","first_seen_on":"2015-03-15T10:09:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-7544"],"journal":"Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1426414083,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25766937?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25766937","pubdate":"2015-03-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Paradoxical widespread c-Fos expression induced by a GABA agonist in the forebrain of transgenic mice with ectopic expression of the GABAA \u03b16 subunit.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/paradoxical-widespread-cfos-expression-induced-gaba-agonist-forebrain-transgenic-mice-ectopic-expres"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4869893,"mean":5.796341651932,"rank":2583836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1627030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4869893,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146379,"mean":10.194383978467,"rank":83315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":46963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146379,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2472,"mean":3.3388101983003,"rank":1296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2472,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":1.0378378378378,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"AT":1,"FI":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gavan_papers\/status\/577048608190533632","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3789675],"posted_on":"2015-03-15T10:08:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Gavan McNally","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_4_normal.png","id_on_source":"gavan_papers","tweeter_id":"2949560604","followers":10},"tweet_id":"577048608190533632"}]}}
