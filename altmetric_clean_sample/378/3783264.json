All infected individuals were represented by juveniles of the family Cyprinidae, except for adults of the dace Leuciscus leuciscus. (L.). Under an average water level (2010) the highest rate of fish invasion was revealed in the estuary zone, where the prevalence of infection (PI) constituted 37.5%, 13.4%, and 5.9% for the gudgeon Gobio gobio, the roach Rutilus rutilus (L.), and the dace L. leuciscus (L.), respectively. An infested carp Cyprinus carpio L. (Heckel) (PI - 13.5%) was recorded in the lower Kargat River, and the goldfish Carassius auratus (L.) (PI - 3.2%), in the lake system. Mean intensity of infection (MI) constituted 1.3, 1.4, 2.5, 2.6, and 1.0 in gudgeon, roach, dace, carp, and bream (Abramis brama L.), respectively. During dry season (2011) with high water salinity only two fish species were infected with P. cuticola metacercariae, the goldfish (PI - 7.9%) and the roach (PI - 1.5%). No correlation between PI and fish density was revealed. It is assumed that the high degree of water salinity is a limiting factor regulating the efficiency of cercariae transition from the first intermediate host (Planorbis planorbis (L.)) to the second one (Pisces, Cyprinidae).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9253cf058f61000dcae","first_seen_on":"2015-03-13T06:55:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"Parazitologiia","last_mentioned_on":1426229656,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25693328?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25693328","pubdate":"2015-02-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"[Differences in the infestation rate of young cyprinid fishes (Cypriniformes) by metacercaria of Posthodiplostomum Cuticola (Digenea, Diplostomatidae) in river and lake systems of the Lake Chany basin (Western Siberia)].","type":"article","volume":"48"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4866623,"mean":5.7967180237154,"rank":2582419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1625413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4866623,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146261,"mean":10.187733146452,"rank":82953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":47060,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146261,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":1.182037037037,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.03125,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/worm_papers\/status\/576275064573673472","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3783264],"posted_on":"2015-03-13T06:54:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Helminth papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/442964093498949632\/nwlIaKzr_normal.jpeg","description":"Automated paper feed twitter bot for academics interested in parasitic worms, gut parasites and anthelminthics","id_on_source":"worm_papers","tweeter_id":"2381877092","geo":{"lt":53.48095,"ln":-2.23743,"country":"GB"},"followers":324},"tweet_id":"576275064573673472"}]}}
