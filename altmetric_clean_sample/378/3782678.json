Methods. Monocyte-derived DCs maturation was elicited by their direct exposure to the LAB strains of L. rhamnosus 900 or L. paracasei 915 (antagonistic and nonantagonistic to H. pylori, resp.), in the presence or absence of H. pylori strain cagA+. The DCs maturation profile was assessed on the basis of surface markers expression and cytokines production. Results. We observed that the LAB strains and the mixtures of LAB with H. pylori are able to induce mature DCs. At the same time, the L. paracasei 915 leads to high IL-10\/IL-12p70 cytokine ratio, in contrast to L. rhamnosus 900. Conclusions. This study showed that the analyzed lactobacilli strains are more potent stimulators of DC maturation than H. pylori. Interestingly from the two chosen LAB strains the antagonistic to H. pylori-L. rhamnosus strain 900 has more proinflammatory and probably antibactericidal properties.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56e8230b2a83eea2188b4572","authors":["Ma\u0142gorzata Wiese","Andrzej Eljaszewicz","Anna Helmin-Basa","Marek Andryszczyk","Ilona Motyl","Jolanta Wieczy\u0144ska","Lidia Gackowska","Izabela Kubiszewska","Milena Januszewska","Jacek Micha\u0142kiewicz"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/106743","first_seen_on":"2015-03-13T00:59:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2314-7156"],"journal":"Journal of Immunology Research","last_mentioned_on":1426208315,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25759836?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25759836","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Lactic Acid Bacteria Strains Exert Immunostimulatory Effect on H. pylori-Induced Dendritic Cells.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lactic-acid-bacteria-strains-exert-immunostimulatory-effect-h-pylori-induced-dendritic-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4870659,"mean":5.7977971810002,"rank":2584272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1627492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4870659,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146209,"mean":10.179920838805,"rank":82916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":47144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146209,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":8.1,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
