However, information on cell surface markers for separating these progenitors in Flk1(+) cells is currently limited. In the present study, we show that distinct types of progenitor cells in Flk1(+) cells could be separated according to the expression of coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR, also known as CXADR), a tight junction component molecule. We found that mouse and human PSC- and mouse embryo-derived Flk1(+) cells could be subdivided into Flk1(+)CAR(+) cells and Flk1(+)CAR(-) cells. The progenitor cells with cardiac potential were almost entirely restricted to Flk1(+)CAR(+) cells, and Flk1(+)CAR(-) cells efficiently differentiated into hematopoietic cells. Endothelial differentiation potential was observed in both populations. Furthermore, from the expression of CAR, Flk1, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b1 (PDGFR\u03b1), Flk1(+) cells could be separated into three populations (Flk1(+)PDGFR\u03b1(-)CAR(-) cells, Flk1(+)PDGFR\u03b1(-)CAR(+) cells, and Flk1(+)PDGFR\u03b1(+)CAR(+) cells). Flk1(+)PDGFR\u03b1(+) cells and Flk1(+)PDGFR\u03b1(-) cells have been reported as cardiac and hematopoietic progenitor cells, respectively. We identified a novel population (Flk1(+)PDGFR\u03b1(-)CAR(+) cells) with the potential to differentiate into not only hematopoietic cells and endothelial cells but also cardiomyocytes. Our findings indicate that CAR would be a novel and prominent marker for separating PSC- and embryo-derived Flk1(+) mesodermal cells with distinct differentiation potentials.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"53c3a1df2a83ee055d8b4567","authors":["Katsuhisa Tashiro","Nobue Hirata","Atsumasa Okada","Tomoko Yamaguchi","Kazuo Takayama","Hiroyuki Mizuguchi","Kenji Kawabata"],"doi":"10.5966\/sctm.2014-0173","first_seen_on":"2015-03-13T08:41:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2157-6580"],"journal":"Stem Cells Translational Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1427092226,"links":["http:\/\/stemcellstm.alphamedpress.org\/content\/early\/2015\/03\/10\/sctm.2014-0173.abstract?papetoc","http:\/\/stemcellstm.alphamedpress.org\/content\/early\/2015\/03\/10\/sctm.2014-0173"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/stemcellstm.alphamedpress.org\/content\/early\/2015\/03\/10\/sctm.2014-0173.full.pdf","pmid":"25762001","title":"Expression of Coxsackievirus and Adenovirus Receptor Separates Hematopoietic and Cardiac Progenitor Cells in Fetal Liver Kinase 1-Expressing Mesoderm","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-coxsackievirus-adenovirus-receptor-separates-hematopoietic-cardiac-progenitor-cells-fetal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4907871,"mean":5.8349917919618,"rank":3276686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1435260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4907871,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146647,"mean":10.211245420946,"rank":99234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":40559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146647,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":486,"mean":6.8513608247423,"rank":361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":486,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":5.6266857142857,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
