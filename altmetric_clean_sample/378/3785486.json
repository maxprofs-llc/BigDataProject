Attachment-based parenting interventions may be particularly useful in decreasing negative outcomes for children exposed to risk contexts, yet high risk families frequently do not engage in programs to address mental health and\/or parenting needs. This study evaluated the effects of Mom Power (MP), a 13-session parenting and self-care skills group program for high-risk mothers and their young children (age <6\u00a0years old), focused on enhancing mothers' mental health, parenting competence, and engagement in treatment. Mothers were referred from community health providers for a phase 1 trial to assess feasibility, acceptability, and pilot outcomes. At baseline, many reported several identified risk factors, including trauma exposure, psychopathology, poverty, and single parenthood. Ninety-nine mother-child pairs were initially recruited into the MP program with 68 women completing and providing pre- and post-self-report measures assessing demographics and trauma history (pre-assessment only), maternal mental health (depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)), parenting, and intervention satisfaction. Results indicate that MP participation was associated with reduction in depression, PTSD, and caregiving helplessness. A dose response relationship was evident in that, despite baseline equivalence, women who attended \u226570\u00a0% of the 10 groups (completers; N\u2009=\u200968) improved on parenting and mental health outcomes, in contrast to non-completers (N\u2009=\u200912). Effects were most pronounced for women with a mental health diagnosis at baseline. The intervention was perceived as helpful and user-friendly. Results indicate that MP is feasible, acceptable, and holds promise for improving maternal mental health and parenting competence among high-risk dyads. Further research is warranted to evaluate the efficacy of MP using randomized controlled designs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002310","authors":["Muzik M","Rosenblum KL","Alfafara EA","Schuster MM","Miller NM","Waddell RM","Kohler ES"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00737-014-0490-z","endpage":"521","first_seen_on":"2015-03-13T17:02:44+00:00","issns":["1435-1102"],"issue":"","journal":"Archives of Women's Mental Health","last_mentioned_on":1474993140,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25577336","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25577336?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00737-014-0490-z.pdf","pmid":"25577336","pubdate":"2015-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Vienna","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"507","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Mom Power: preliminary outcomes of a group intervention to improve mental health and parenting among high-risk mothers.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mom-power-preliminary-outcomes-group-intervention-improve-mental-health-parenting-among-highrisk-mot"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":3425176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4988742,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204804,"mean":9.46771814866,"rank":71962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":131814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204804,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":421,"mean":5.9033095238095,"rank":182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":421,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":5.5111111111111,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Student  > Ph.
