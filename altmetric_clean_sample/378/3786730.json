Prominent among these non-motor phenomena are mood disturbance, cognitive decline and dementia, sleep disorders, hyposmia and autonomic failure. In addition, visual symptoms are common, ranging from complaints of dry eyes and reading difficulties, through to perceptual disturbances (feelings of presence and passage) and complex visual hallucinations. Such visual symptoms are a considerable cause of morbidity in Parkinson's disease and, with respect to visual hallucinations, are an important predictor of cognitive decline as well as institutional care and mortality. Evidence exists of visual dysfunction at several levels of the visual pathway in Parkinson's disease. This includes psychophysical, electrophysiological and morphological evidence of disruption of retinal structure and function, in addition to disorders of 'higher' (cortical) visual processing. In this review, we will draw together work from animal and human studies in an attempt to provide an insight into how Parkinson's disease affects the retina and how these changes might contribute to the visual symptoms experienced by patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000242e","authors":["Archibald NK","Clarke MP","Mosimann UP","Burn DJ","Archibald, Neil K.","Clarke, Michael P.","Mosimann, Urs P.","Burn, David J.","N.
