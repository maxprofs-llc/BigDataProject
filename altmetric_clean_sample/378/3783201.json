The model involved exposure of an intruder (subject) mouse to a resident aggressor mouse followed by exposure to trauma reminders with rest periods. C57BL\/6 mice exposed to SJL aggressor mice exhibited behaviors suggested as PTSD-in-mouse phenotypes: intermittent freezing, reduced locomotion, avoidance of the aggressor-associated cue and apparent startled jumping. Brain tissues (amygdala, hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, septal region, corpus striatum and ventral striatum) from subject (aggressor exposed: Agg-E) and control C57BL\/6 mice were collected at one, 10 and 42 days post aggressor exposure sessions. Transcripts in these brain regions were assayed using Agilent's mouse genome-wide arrays.\nPathways and biological processes associated with differentially regulated genes were mainly those thought to be involved in fear-related behavioral responses and neuronal signaling. Expression-based assessments of activation patterns showed increased activations of pathways related to anxiety disorders (hyperactivity and fear responses), impaired cognition, mood disorders, circadian rhythm disruption, and impaired territorial and aggressive behaviors. In amygdala, activations of these pathways were more pronounced at earlier time-points, with some attenuation after longer rest periods. In hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, activation patterns were observed at later time points. Signaling pathways associated with PTSD-comorbid conditions, such as diabetes, metabolic disorder, inflammation and cardiac infarction, were also significantly enriched. In contrast, signaling processes related to neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity were inhibited.\nOur data suggests activations of behavioral responses associated with anxiety disorders as well as inhibition of neuronal signaling pathways important for neurogenesis, cognition and extinction of fear memory. These pathways along with comorbid-related signaling pathways indicate the pervasive and multisystem effects of aggressor exposure in mice, potentially mirroring the pathologic conditions of PTSD patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000872","authors":["Muhie, Seid","Gautam, Aarti","Meyerhoff, James","Chakraborty, Nabarun","Hammamieh, Rasha","Jett, Marti"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13041-015-0104-3","first_seen_on":"2015-03-13T06:01:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1756-6606"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Brain","last_mentioned_on":1433695448,"links":["http:\/\/www.molecularbrain.com\/content\/8\/1\/14\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25888136","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25888136?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4359441\/pdf\/13041_2015_Article_104.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.molecularbrain.com\/content\/pdf\/s13041-015-0104-3.pdf","pmid":"25888136","pubdate":"2015-02-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"14","subjects":["molecularbiology","brain"],"title":"Brain transcriptome profiles in mouse model simulating features of post-traumatic stress disorder","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/brain-transcriptome-profiles-mouse-model-simulating-features-posttraumatic-stress-disorder"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5200000,"mean":6.1332428102415,"rank":1297505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3296326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5200000,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152854,"mean":10.285037428117,"rank":51138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":99758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152854,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":360,"mean":3.2274874651811,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":360,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":4.0309523809524,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
