Statistical methods play a crucial role in understanding and analyzing fMRI data. Bayesian approaches, in particular, have shown great promise in applications. A remarkable feature of fully Bayesian approaches is that they allow a flexible modeling of spatial and temporal correlations in the data. This paper provides a review of the most relevant models developed in recent years. We divide methods according to the objective of the analysis. We start from spatio-temporal models for fMRI data that detect task-related activation patterns. We then address the very important problem of estimating brain connectivity. We also touch upon methods that focus on making predictions of an individual's brain activity or a clinical or behavioral response. We conclude with a discussion of recent integrative models that aim at combining fMRI data with other imaging modalities, such as EEG\/MEG and DTI data, measured on the same subjects. We also briefly discuss the emerging field of imaging genetics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008cd7","authors":["Zhang L","Guindani M","Vannucci M","Linlin Zhang","Michele Guindani","Marina Vannucci"],"doi":"10.1002\/wics.1339","endpage":"41","first_seen_on":"2015-03-14T13:08:38+00:00","funders":["nci","niehs"],"issns":["1939-5108","19395108"],"issue":"1","journal":"Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Statistics","last_mentioned_on":1429383570,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25750690\/"],"pmcid":"PMC4346370","pmid":"25750690","pubdate":"2015-03-11T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"21","title":"Bayesian Models for fMRI Data Analysis.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/wics.1339","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bayesian-models-functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging-data-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5007431,"mean":5.9306626337293,"rank":1965923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3010220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5007431,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148990,"mean":10.269506688413,"rank":57307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":90444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148990,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":2.0092957746479,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
