Patients with rheumatic diseases need a comprehensive and interdisciplinary treatment. In this connection patient education takes the part to lead patients to a better self-management. The goals of patient education are: to increase knowledge and interoception, to influence attitudes and self-efficacy and in addition to improve the disease or health behaviour. The study group \"patient education\" of the German Society of Rheumatology (DGRh) developed several education programmes, which methods and topics are based on behavioural science. The program for patients with spondyloarthritis is topic entered and close to patients needs. It is an interdisciplinary course, carried out by a qualified education team. The course contains 6 modules each lasting 90 minutes. The efficacy has been proved in different levels as well as return to work, economic advantages have been shown. Particularly patients with early spondyloarthritis and noticeable scores in the self-assessments (BASDAI, FFbH-R, AHI) profited from the education course.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008cd0","authors":["Ehlebracht-K\u00f6nig I","B\u00f6nisch A"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10354-008-0525-z","first_seen_on":"2015-03-14T08:53:25+00:00","issns":["0043-5341"],"issue":"7-8","journal":"Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift (WMW)","last_mentioned_on":1426323194,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/18500474\/"],"pmid":"18500474","pubdate":"2008-05-27T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"General Practice \/ Family Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Geriatrics\/Gerontology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Patient education in the early treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and related forms of spondyloarthritis].","type":"article","volume":"158","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/patientenschulung-im-fr%C3%BChen-krankheitsmanagement-der-spondylitis-ankylosans-und-verwandter-spondyloa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4868490,"mean":5.7954838530026,"rank":4073165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4868490,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146189,"mean":10.1724978384,"rank":121715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146189,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153,"mean":2.3948947368421,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"[Patient education in the early treatment of ankylosing spondylitis... - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/850938688283294\/posts\/862317733812056","license":"public","citation_ids":[3787170],"posted_on":"2015-03-14T08:53:14+00:00","summary":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/18500474\/ http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/18500474\/ http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?ie=UTF-8&q=ankylosing+spondylitis+patient+education&revid=1755840938&sa=X&ei=grQBVffwLo_18QW6r4LYAQ&ved=0CAcQ1QIoAg ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","author":{"name":"Non-communicable, Autoimmune, Rheumatic and Genetic Diseases Nepal","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/850938688283294","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/850938688283294\/picture","id_on_source":"850938688283294"}}]}}
