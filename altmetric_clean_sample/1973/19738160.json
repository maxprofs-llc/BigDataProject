To expand the structural diversities and clinical application of colchicinoids, many attempts have been established for the derivatives with better activity or less toxicity. Herein, in this paper, we report a direct microbial transformation of colchicine into 2-O-demethyl-colchicine (M1) and 3-O-demethl-colchicine (M2) by Streptomyces griseus ATCC 13273. It is noteworthy that when DMF was used as co-solvent, the yield of M1 and M2 could reach up to 51 and 31%, respectively. All the structures of the metabolites were elucidated unambiguously by ESI-MS, (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, and 2D-NMR spectroscopy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a88","authors":["Chao Zhang","Xian Sun","Shao Hua Xu","Bo Yang Yu","Jian Zhang"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12010-017-2480-x","first_seen_on":"2017-04-30T10:12:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0273-2289","1559-0291"],"journal":"Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1493547069,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28455804?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28455804","pubdate":"2017-04-30T22:00:49+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"Microbial Catalyzed Regio-Selective Demethylation of Colchicine by Streptomyces griseus ATCC 13273","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154803,"mean":6.8922645386048,"rank":7061657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154803,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234845,"mean":12.642126867197,"rank":190833,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234845,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":773,"mean":2.0210077720207,"rank":467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":773,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":0.81527777777778,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Strep_papers\/statuses\/858624759038226432","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19738160],"posted_on":"2017-04-30T10:11:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Strep_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513367728158044160\/4aRFryWr_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Streptomyces papers in #Pubmed\r\ncreated and curated by @paulhoskisson","id_on_source":"Strep_papers","tweeter_id":"2822299628","geo":{"lt":55.86515,"ln":-4.25763,"country":"GB"},"followers":321},"tweet_id":"858624759038226432"}]}}
