Furthermore, most vocal events have implications for our actions and therefore include action-related features. But the relevance and irrelevance of vocal features varies from task to task. The present study investigates binding processes for perceptual and action-related features of spoken words and their modulation by the task representation of the listener. Participants reacted with two response keys to eight different words spoken by a male or a female voice (Experiment 1) or spoken by an angry or neutral male voice (Experiment 2). There were two instruction conditions: half of participants learned eight stimulus-response mappings by rote (SR), and half of participants applied a binary task rule (TR). In both experiments, SR instructed participants showed clear evidence for binding processes between voice and response features indicated by an interaction between the irrelevant voice feature and the response. By contrast, as indicated by a three-way interaction with instruction, no such binding was found in the TR instructed group. These results are suggestive of binding and shielding as two adaptive mechanisms that ensure successful communication and action in a dynamic social environment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f610001433","authors":["Johanna Bogon","Hedwig Eisenbarth","Steffen Landgraf","Gesine Dreisbach"],"doi":"10.1080\/17470218.2016.1209686","first_seen_on":"2017-03-17T11:21:56+00:00","issns":["1747-0218","1747-0226"],"journal":"The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1489749766,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17470218.2016.1209686#.WMvGcd-QfsY.twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17470218.2016.1209686"],"pmid":"27383254","pubdate":"2017-09-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","psychology"],"title":"Shielding voices: The modulation of binding processes between voice features and response features by task representations","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17470218.2016.1209686","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shielding-voices-modulation-binding-processes-between-voice-features-response-features-task-represen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":1.35,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":4158647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4149852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265968,"mean":13.109285294792,"rank":135601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":127723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265968,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":767,"mean":11.13935770235,"rank":406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":767,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.8777777777778,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
