Very few pregnancies have been reported among such patients. In this report we describe the evolution and successful outcome of pregnancy in 5 Greek women with beta-thalassaemia major. There were four full-term and one preterm deliveries of two normal and three small for the date neonates. Cardiovascular changes related to gestation may aggravate the underlying multiorgan damage of the pregnant mother and predispose to poor fetal growth and development. All five patients followed a strict transfusion regimen in order to maintain the haemoglobin level above 10 g\/dl. The inadvertent administration of desferrioxamine in one patient until the 8th gestational week did not seem to have any serious effects on the development and well-being of the fetus. Although pregnancy is not contraindicated in beta-thalassaemia major, intensive individualized care is required if it is to be safe for the mother, and have a reasonably good chance of producing a healthy child.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002845","authors":["Tampakoudis, P","Tsatalas, C","Mamopoulos, M","Tantanassis, T","Christakis, J I","Sinakos, Z","Mantalenakis, S","Panagiotis Tampakoudis","Costas Tsatalas","Michalis Mamopoulos","Theocharis Tantanassis","John I.
