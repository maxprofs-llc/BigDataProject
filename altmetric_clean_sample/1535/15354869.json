However, there are geographic differences in the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of H. pylori, and in the availability of medications and endoscopy. Thus, nationwide or regional consensus statements are needed to improve control of H. pylori infection and gastric cancer.\nThis consensus statement for management of H. pylori in Taiwan has three major sections: (1) optimal diagnosis and indications; (2) current treatment strategies; and (3) screening-to-treat and surveillance for control of gastric cancer. The literature review emphasized recent data for development of draft statements and determination of levels of evidence. Twenty-five Taiwan experts conducted a consensus conference, by a modified Delphi process, to modify the draft statements. Consensus, defined as an agreement of least 80% of the experts, and recommendation grade were determined by anonymous voting.\nThere were 24 consensus statements. Section\u00a01 has seven statements on recommendations for the diagnosis and indications for treatment of H. pylori infection. Section 2 has 10 statements that provide an updated treatment algorithm for first-line, second-line, and third-line regimens. Section 3 has seven statements regarding H. pylori eradication for reducing the risk of gastric cancer, with a cost-benefit analysis. After H. pylori eradication, the consensus highlights the use of endoscopic surveillance and\/or chemoprevention to further reduce the burden of gastric cancer.\nThis consensus statement has updated recommendations for improving the clinical management of H. pylori infection in areas such as Taiwan, which have high prevalence of H. pylori infection and gastric cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029d3","authors":["Sheu, Bor-Shyang","Wu, Ming-Shiang","Chiu, Cheng-Tang","Lo, Jing-Chuan","Wu, Deng-Chyang","Liou, Jyh-Ming","Wu, Chun-Ying","Cheng, Hsiu-Chi","Lee, Yi-Chia","Hsu, Ping-I","Chang, Chun-Chao","Chang, Wei-Lun","Lin, Jaw-Town","Sheu, Bor\u2010Shyang","Wu, Ming\u2010Shiang","Chiu, Cheng\u2010Tang","Lo, Jing\u2010Chuan","Wu, Deng\u2010Chyang","Liou, Jyh\u2010Ming","Wu, Chun\u2010Ying","Cheng, Hsiu\u2010Chi","Lee, Yi\u2010Chia","Hsu, Ping\u2010I","Chang, Chun\u2010Chao","Chang, Wei\u2010Lun","Lin, Jaw\u2010Town"],"doi":"10.1111\/hel.12368","first_seen_on":"2017-01-10T08:31:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1523-5378","10834389"],"journal":"Helicobacter","last_mentioned_on":1487316326,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28066960","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/hel.12368\/full?hootPostID=020333d4ff6ae32ce53990b5ba2403a7","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/hel.12368\/full?hootPostID=db4ed42f8e197eb2b59c6bb2225c0123"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/hel.12368\/pdf","pmid":"28066960","pubdate":"2017-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["bacteriology"],"title":"\n              Consensus on the clinical management, screening-to-treat, and surveillance of\n              Helicobacter pylori\n              infection to improve gastric cancer control on a nationwide scale\n            ","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/hel.12368","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/consensus-clinical-management-screeningtotreat-surveillance-helicobacter-pylori-infection-improve-ga"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":3.45,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":1984531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6228997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264609,"mean":12.679300157213,"rank":86416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":177517,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264609,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":294,"mean":2.3588395904437,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":294,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.4757142857143,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
