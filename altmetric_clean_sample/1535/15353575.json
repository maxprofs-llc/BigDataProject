The present longitudinal study explored the relationships among NSS, psychiatric symptoms, and functional outcomes in 151 Chinese patients with chronic schizophrenia across a 6-month period. The participants completed neurological assessments at baseline (Time 1), psychiatric interviews at Time 1 and 3-month follow-up (Time 2), and self-report measures on daily functioning at 6-month follow-up (Time 3). Two possible (combined and cascading) path models were examined on predicting the functional outcomes. Direct and indirect effects of Time 1 NSS on Time 3 functional outcomes via Time 2 psychiatric symptoms were evaluated using path analysis under bootstrapping. Motor coordination and sequencing NSS did not have significant direct effects on functional outcomes. Motor coordination NSS exerted significant and negative indirect effects on functional outcomes via psychiatric symptoms. These results contribute to a better understanding of the determinants of functional outcomes by showing significant indirect pathways from motor coordination NSS to functional outcomes via psychiatric symptoms. That motor sequencing NSS did not affect functional outcomes either directly or indirectly may be explained by their trait marking features.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d2","authors":["Ted C.T.
