We investigated how the loss of LSR induced cell migration, invasion and proliferation in endometrial cancer cell line Sawano. mRNAs of amphiregulin (AREG) and TEA domain family member 1 (TEAD1) were markedly upregulated by siRNA-LSR. In endometrial cancer tissues, downregulation of LSR and upregulation of AREG were observed together with malignancy, and Yes-associated protein (YAP) was present in the nuclei. siRNA-AREG prevented the cell migration and invasion induced by siRNA-LSR, whereas treatment with AREG induced cell migration and invasion. LSR was colocalized with TRIC, angiomotin (AMOT), Merlin and phosphorylated YAP (pYAP). siRNA-LSR increased expression of pYAP and decreased that of AMOT and Merlin. siRNA-YAP prevented expression of the mRNAs of AREG and TEAD1, and the cell migration and invasion induced by siRNA-LSR. Treatment with dobutamine and 2-deoxy-D-glucose and glucose starvation induced the pYAP expression and prevented the cell migration and invasion induced by siRNA-LSR. siRNA-AMOT decreased the Merlin expression and prevented the cell migration and invasion induced by siRNA-LSR. The loss of LSR promoted cell invasion and migration via upregulation of TEAD1\/AREG dependent on YAP\/pYAP and AMOT\/Merlin in human endometrial cancer cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Hiroshi Shimada","Shyuetsu Abe","Takayuki Kohno","Seiro Satohisa","Takumi Konno","Syunta Takahashi","Tsubasa Hatakeyama","Chihiro Arimoto","Takuya Kakuki","Yakuto Kaneko","Ken-ichi Takano","Tsuyoshi Saito","Takashi Kojima"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep37049","first_seen_on":"2017-01-10T10:26:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1484043548,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep37049?WT.feed_name=subjects_cancer&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28071680","pubdate":"2017-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cancer models","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Tight junctions","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Loss of tricellular tight junction protein LSR promotes cell invasion and migration via upregulation of TEAD1\/AREG in human endometrial cancer","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/loss-tricellular-tight-junction-protein-lsr-promotes-cell-invasion-migration-via-upregulation-tead1a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8038089,"mean":6.8236667777181,"rank":6957763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8038089,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254231,"mean":12.772493844157,"rank":209737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254231,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32577,"mean":14.969480967584,"rank":27620,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32577,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3247,"mean":16.275862600123,"rank":2656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3247,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
