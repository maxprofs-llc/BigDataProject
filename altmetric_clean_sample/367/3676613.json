We present a case of endophthalmitis due to Microbacterium species that occurred after accidental trauma and review the literature on microbacterium infections. If the infected tissue or medical device is removed and antimicrobial therapy (preferably with beta-lactams or glycopeptides) is instituted, the prognosis is usually favorable for patients with microbacterium infections.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255e","authors":["Guido Funke","Gerhard Haase","Norbert Schnitzler","Norbert Schrage","Ralf Ren\u00e9 Reinert"],"doi":"10.1093\/clind\/24.4.713","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T19:01:54+00:00","issns":["1537-6591","1058-4838"],"journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1407889749,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org\/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=9145748","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/clind\/24.4.713","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9145748"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cid.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/24\/4\/713.full.pdf","pmid":"9145748","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Endophthalmitis due to Microbacterium species: case report and review of microbacterium infections.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endophthalmitis-due-microbacterium-species-case-report-review-microbacterium-infections"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4136710,"mean":5.1105400203632,"rank":963674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2610553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4136710,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140548,"mean":9.1066775953954,"rank":43517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":95066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140548,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4958,"mean":5.3547318942909,"rank":1506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2885,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4958,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":12.621290909091,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
