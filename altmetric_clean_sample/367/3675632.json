Based on the results of numerical taxonomy, the isolates formed two clusters (1 and 2) with some single isolates at a similarity level of 82 %. Cluster 1 contained six isolates from Astragalus and Lespedeza spp. Cluster 2 consisted of nine isolates from Astragalus spp. DNA relatedness was greater than 80 % among isolates within cluster 2. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that CCBAU 7190B(T), representing cluster 2, was closely related to Rhizobium galegae and Rhizobium huautlense. DNA-DNA relatedness between CCBAU 7190B(T) and reference strains of R. galegae, R. huautlense and other related species ranged from 0 to 48.6 %. The cluster 2 isolates could also be differentiated phenotypically from related species. Based on these data, a novel species, Rhizobium loessense sp. nov., is proposed for cluster 2, with the type strain CCBAU 7190B(T) (=AS1.3401(T)=LMG 21975(T)).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["Ge Hong Wei","Zhi Yuan Tan","Ming E Zhu","En Tao Wang","Su Zhen Han","Wen Xin Chen"],"doi":"10.1099\/ijs.0.02031-0","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T18:29:42+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1466-5034","1466-5026"],"issue":"Pt 5","journal":"International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1404149848,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1099\/ijs.0.02031-0"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ijs.sgmjournals.org\/content\/53\/5\/1575.full.pdf","pmid":"13130051","pubdate":"2003-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Characterization of rhizobia isolated from legume species within the genera Astragalus and Lespedeza grown in the Loess Plateau of China and description of Rhizobium loessense sp. nov.","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-rhizobia-isolated-legume-species-within-genera-astragalusand-lespedeza-grown-loess"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3977256,"mean":5.0338134231527,"rank":913671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2520580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3977256,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132237,"mean":9.0963001777142,"rank":40302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":90263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132237,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1771,"mean":2.6309292586304,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":674,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1771,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":1.1275698924731,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
