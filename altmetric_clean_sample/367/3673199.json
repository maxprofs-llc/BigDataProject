These filaments can curl into fimbrial or nonfimbrial surface structures (e.g., a capsule or spore coat). This article reviews the phylogeny of operons belonging to the chaperone\/usher assembly class to explore the utility of establishing a scheme for subdividing them into clades of phylogenetically related gene clusters. Based on usher amino acid sequence comparisons, our analysis shows that the chaperone\/usher assembly class is subdivided into six major phylogenetic clades, which we have termed alpha-, beta-, gamma-, kappa-, pi-, and sigma-fimbriae. Members of each clade share related operon structures and encode fimbrial subunits with similar protein domains. The proposed classification system offers a simple and convenient method for assigning newly discovered chaperone\/usher systems to one of the six major phylogenetic groups.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5043cf058f6100030c7","authors":["Sean-Paul Nuccio","Andreas J.
