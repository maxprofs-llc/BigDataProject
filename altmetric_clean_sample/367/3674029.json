JSC-1, an Arizona volcanic ash that has mineral properties similar to those of lunar soil, is used to produce lunar environments for instrument and equipment testing. NASA is concerned about potential health risks to workers exposed to these fine dusts in test facilities. The potential toxicity of JSC-1 lunar soil simulant and a Martian soil simulant (JSC-Mars-1, a Hawaiian volcanic ash) was evaluated using human alveolar macrophages (HAM) isolated from volunteers; titanium dioxide and quartz were used as reference dusts. This investigation is a prerequisite to studies of actual lunar dust. HAM were treated in vitro with these test dusts for 24 h; assays of cell viability and apoptosis showed that JSC-1 and TiO2 were comparable, and more toxic than saline control but less toxic than quartz. HAM treated with JSC-1 or JSC-Mars 1 showed a dose-dependent increase in cytotoxicity. To elucidate the mechanism by which these dusts induce apoptosis, we investigated the involvement of scavenger receptors (SR). Pretreatment of cells with polyinosinic acid, an SR blocker, significantly inhibited both apoptosis and necrosis. These results suggest HAM cytotoxicity may be initiated by interaction of the dust particles with SR. Besides being cytotoxic, silica is known to induce shifting of HAM phenotypes to an immune active status. The immunomodulatory effect of the dust simulants was investigated. Treatment of HAM with either simulant caused preferential damage to the suppressor macrophage subpopulation, leading to a net increase in the ratio of activator (RFD1+) to suppressor (RFD1+7+) macrophages, an effect similar to that of treatment with silica. It is recommended that appropriate precautions be used to minimize exposure to these fine dusts in large-scale engineering applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5273cf058f610003db6","authors":["Latch JN","Hamilton RF Jr","Holian A","James JT","Lam CW"],"doi":"10.1080\/08958370701821219","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T17:37:22+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Inhalation Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1398654435,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18236230","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/08958370701821219"],"pmid":"18236230","pubdate":"2008-02-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Toxicity of lunar and martian dust simulants to alveolar macrophages isolated from human volunteers.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/toxicity-lunar-martian-dust-simulants-alveolar-macrophages-isolated-human-volunteers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3700551,"mean":4.9683396592431,"rank":839028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2337484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3700551,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110743,"mean":8.7775016344296,"rank":31665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":77848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110743,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195,"mean":3.6975257731959,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":2.0333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
