The discovery was unplanned in the sense that it resulted from the observation of unanticipated phenomena made In the course of experiments undertaken for a different purpose. However, the sequence of events which occurred IS an Illustration of the discovery of a practical, useful result from a program of research which was primarily of a basic nature but with ancillary awareness of possible practical implications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f5d","authors":["F.
