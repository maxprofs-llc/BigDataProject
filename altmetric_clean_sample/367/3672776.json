Forty-four women were pregnant or became pregnant during the study period. The progression to HIV-related disease, AIDS, and mortality from AIDS was compared in the pregnant and nonpregnant cohorts. The mean follow-up time was 44 months. Overall, 32 of the 140 women (38%) developed AIDS, and 26 (19%) died from AIDS during the study period, with a cumulative AIDS incidence rate of 16% at 3 years after study entry. There was a trend toward earlier manifestation of HIV-related symptoms among the pregnant cohort, but no significant difference was observed in the rate of progression to AIDS or death between the pregnant and nonpregnant women.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c37","authors":["M M Deschamps","J W Pape","M Desvarieux","P Williams-Russo","S Madhavan","J L Ho","W D Johnson"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T16:55:32+00:00","issns":["0894-9255"],"issue":"5","journal":"JAIDS: Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes","last_mentioned_on":1398326005,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8483108"],"pmid":"8483108","pubdate":"1993-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome","sexuallytransmitteddiseases"],"title":"A prospective study of HIV-seropositive asymptomatic women of childbearing age in a developing country.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prospective-study-hivseropositive-asymptomatic-women-childbearing-age-developing-country-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3689698,"mean":4.9605763920484,"rank":835691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2329910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3689698,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106865,"mean":8.71559468109,"rank":30110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":75562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106865,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1178,"mean":2.5963279524214,"rank":227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":869,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1178,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":1.6052258064516,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Structural violence in Haiti","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=605575874#altmetric_citation_20","license":"public","citation_ids":[3672776],"posted_on":"2014-04-24T07:53:25+00:00","summary":"As defined by Medical Anthropologist Dr. Paul Farmer, structural violence is the way by which social arrangements are constructed to put specific members of a population in harm's way.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=42212196","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Sarah.heberlig","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Sarah.heberlig"}}]}}
