Due to their unique surface properties, silicone polymers are extensively used to modify surface properties of various materials, although the effects of functionalization of silicones and relevant process conditions on modification of substrates are not well understood. Specifically we show a considerable reduction in fabric friction, roughness and waviness upon treatment with quaternized silicones. The treatment at acidic pH results in better deposition of silicone polymers onto the fabric as confirmed through streaming potential measurements which show charge reversal of the fabric. Interestingly, Raman spectroscopy studies show the band of C-O ring stretching mode at \u223c1095 cm(-1) shift towards higher wavenumber indicating lowering of stress in fibers upon appropriate silicone treatment. Thus along with the morphological and frictional properties being altered, silicone treatment can lead to a reduction in fabric strain. It is concluded that the electrostatic interactions play an initial role in modification of the fiber substrate followed by multilayer deposition of polymer. This multi-technique approach to study fiber properties upon treatment by combining macro to molecular level methods has helped in understanding of new functional coating materials.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d15","doi":"10.1016\/j.jcis.2014.04.011","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T19:59:09+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Colloid & Interface Science","last_mentioned_on":1415384010,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jcis.2014.04.011"],"pmid":"24863788","pubdate":"2014-05-28T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Modification of surface properties of cellulosic substrates by quaternized silicone emulsions.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modification-surface-properties-cellulosic-substrates-quaternized-silicone-emulsions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4478505,"mean":4.7770715355304,"rank":983679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":2922260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4478505,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158587,"mean":7.5341045741744,"rank":41944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":114748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158587,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":497,"mean":1.7982903225806,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":497,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":3.6277777777778,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":3}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Ponisseril Somasundaran","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=632853993#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3678227],"posted_on":"2014-11-07T18:13:30+00:00","summary":"Dr. Ponisseril Somasundaran is a US mineral engineer of Indian origin and a LaVon Duddleson Krumb Professor of Mineral Engineering of Columbia University, New York.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=44330577","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Tachs","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Tachs"}}]}}
