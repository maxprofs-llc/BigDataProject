Based on phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences, the seven isolates belong to the Alphaproteobacteria and are related to Phyllobacterium myrsinacearum strains. The isolates formed three clusters; clusters A and C consist of Tunisian strains, whereas cluster B consists of two strains from Brassica napus from France. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on the atpD gene strongly supports their affiliation to the genus Phyllobacterium. DNA-DNA hybridizations revealed that (i) none of the isolates belong to the species P. myrsinacearum, (ii) clusters A and C represent two distinct genomospecies and (iii) the two strains of cluster B represent two separate genomospecies. Distinctive phenotypic features were deduced from numerical analysis of phenotypic data. Based on this polyphasic approach, four novel species are proposed: Phyllobacterium leguminum sp. nov. (type strain ORS 1419T = CFBP 6745T = LMG 22833T), Phyllobacterium ifriqiyense sp. nov. (type strain STM 370T = CFBP 6742T = LMG 22831T), Phyllobacterium brassicacearum sp. nov. (type strain STM 196T = CFBP 5551T = LMG 22836T) and Phyllobacterium bourgognense sp. nov. (type strain STM 201T = CFBP 5553T = LMG 22837T). The description of the genus Phyllobacterium is emended accordingly.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["Sophie Mantelin","Marion Fischer-Le
