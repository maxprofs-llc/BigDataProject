Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences show that the three isolates belong to the genus Halomonas in the gamma-Proteobacteria and form an independent genetic line. Phenotypically, they share the characteristics of Halomonas and differ from the most closely related species, Halomonas campisalis, in the following features: they are strictly aerobic and, because of their production of exopolysaccharides, form cream-coloured, mucoid colonies; they produce phosphatase and grow within narrow pH and temperature ranges; and they are susceptible to kanamycin and streptomycin. Their G+C content varies between 60.0 and 61.4 mol%. The name Halomonas anticariensis sp. nov. is proposed for these isolates. Strain FP35T (=LMG 22089T=CECT 5854T) is the type strain. The bacterium grows best in 7.5% (w\/v) NaCl and does not require magnesium or potassium salts for growth, although they do stimulate growth somewhat when present. Its major fatty acids are 18 : 1omega7c, 16 : 0, 16 : 1omega7c, 15 : 0 iso 2-OH, 12 : 0 3-OH, 12 : 0, 10 : 0 and 19 : 0 cyclo omega8c. Its predominant respiratory lipoquinone is ubiquinone with nine isoprene units (Q-9).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["M.
