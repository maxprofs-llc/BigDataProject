A small set of propafenone derivatives was synthesized, and both use-dependency and recovery from block were tested in order to gain insight into the behavior of these compounds with respect to trapping and non-trapping. Ligand-protein docking into homology models of the closed and open state of the hERG channel provides the first evidence for the molecular basis of drug trapping.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e5f","authors":["Thai, Khac\u2010Minh","Windisch, Andreas","Stork, Daniela","Weinzinger, Anna","Schiesaro, Andrea","Guy, Robert\u2005H.","Timin, Eugen\u2005N.","Hering, Steffen","Ecker, Gerhard\u2005F.","Thai KM","Windisch A","Stork D","Weinzinger A","Schiesaro A","Guy RH","Timin EN","Hering S","Ecker GF"],"doi":"10.1002\/cmdc.200900374","endpage":"442","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T15:32:55+00:00","issns":["1860-7187","1860-7179","18607187"],"issue":"3","journal":"ChemMedChem","last_mentioned_on":1341952978,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/cmdc.200900374"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cmdc.200900374\/pdf","pmid":"20146282","pubdate":"2010-02-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"436","subjects":["chemistry","pharmacology"],"title":"The hERG Potassium Channel and Drug Trapping: Insight from Docking Studies with Propafenone Derivatives","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/herg-potassium-channel-drug-trapping-insight-docking-studies-propafenone-derivatives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630815,"mean":4.9285062716012,"rank":816179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630815,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98029,"mean":8.1800289305099,"rank":25534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98029,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":722,"mean":2.0544493758669,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":598,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":722,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":5.7752307692308,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
