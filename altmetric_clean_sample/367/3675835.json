Various delivery techniques and bone cements have been developed. StabiliT Vertebral Augmentation System (DFINE Inc., San Jose, CA) is a unique radiofrequency (RF) based system which delivers an ultra-high viscosity bone cement. The patented StabiliT ER bone cement has an extended working time prior to RF warming. When delivered through this unique hydraulic system an on-demand ultra-high viscosity cement can be delivered into an osteotome created cavity resulting in a clinical procedure with the best qualities of both vertebroplasty and conventional balloon assisted kyphoplasty.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9243cf058f61000db54","authors":["Scott C.
