On the basis of 16S rRNA and recA gene sequence similarities, the isolate was allocated to the genus Pseudochrobactrum. This was confirmed by fatty acid data (major fatty acids: C(18 : 1)omega7c and C(19 : 0) cyclo omega8c), a polar lipid profile exhibiting major characteristics of Pseudochrobactrum (phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine), quinone system Q-10 and a polyamine pattern with the predominant compounds spermidine and putrescine. DNA-DNA hybridization with the type strains of the two established species of Pseudochrobactrum and physiological and biochemical data clearly differentiated the isolate from established Pseudochrobactrum species. As a consequence, this organism represents a novel species, for which the name Pseudochrobactrum kiredjianiae sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain CCUG 49584(T) (=CIP 109227(T)).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["Peter K\u00e4mpfer","Holger Scholz","Birgit Huber","Kathrin Thummes","Hans-J\u00fcrgen Busse","Elizabeth W.
