Comparative analysis of drugs based on their DILI potential is an effective approach to discover key DILI mechanisms and risk factors. However, assessing the DILI potential of a drug is a challenge with no existing consensus methods. We proposed a systematic classification scheme using FDA-approved drug labeling to assess the DILI potential of drugs, which yielded a benchmark dataset with 287 drugs representing a wide range of therapeutic categories and daily dosage amounts. The method is transparent and reproducible with a potential to serve as a common practice to study the DILI of marketed drugs for supporting drug discovery and biomarker development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002734","doi":"10.1016\/j.drudis.2011.05.007","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T17:01:36+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Drug Discovery Today","last_mentioned_on":1417922193,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.drudis.2011.05.007"],"pmid":"21624500","pubdate":"2011-06-01T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"FDA-approved drug labeling for the study of drug-induced liver injury.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fdaapproved-drug-labeling-study-druginduced-liver-injury"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4591036,"mean":5.3874845613204,"rank":1064410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2956258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4591036,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163679,"mean":8.9339941959214,"rank":48329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":113304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163679,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":672,"mean":4.3029508196721,"rank":191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":672,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":3.521375,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":37,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
