Here, we developed an algorithm that determines the molecular axis of amphiphilicity and the cross-sectional area, ADcalc, perpendicular to this axis. Starting from the conformational ensemble of each molecule, the three-dimensional conformation selected as the membrane-binding conformation was the one with the smallest cross-sectional area, ADcalcM, and the strongest amphiphilicity. The calculated, ADcalcM, and the measured, AD, cross-sectional areas correlated linearly (n=55, slope, m=1.04, determination coefficient, r2=0.95). The calculated cross-sectional areas, ADcalcM, were then used together with the calculated octanol-water distribution coefficients, log D7.4, of the 55 compounds (with a known ability to permeate the blood-brain barrier) to establish a calibration diagram for the prediction of blood-brain barrier permeation. It yielded a limiting cross-sectional area (ADcalcM=70 A2) and an optimal range of octanol-water distribution coefficients (-1.4<or=log D7.4<7.0). The calibration diagram was validated with an independent set of 43 compounds with the known ability to permeate the blood-brain barrier, yielding a prediction accuracy of 86%. The incorrectly predicted compounds exhibited log D7.4 values comprised between -0.6 and -1.4, suggesting that the limitation for log D7.4 is less rigorous than the limitation for AD. An accuracy of 83% has been obtained for a second validation set of 42 compounds which were previously shown to be difficult to predict. The calculated parameters, ADcalcM and log D7.4, thus allow for a fast and accurate prediction of blood-brain barrier permeation. Analogous calibration diagrams can be established for other membrane barriers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5723cf058f610004c74","authors":["Gr\u00e9gori Gerebtzoff and","Anna Seelig*"],"doi":"10.1021\/ci0600814","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T17:07:31+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1549-9596","1549-960X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Chemical Information & Modeling","last_mentioned_on":1420070400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/ci0600814","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17125204"],"pmid":"17125204","pubdate":"2006-11-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":" American Chemical Society ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Computation Theory And Mathematics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Social Sciences","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"subjects":["chemistry","medicalinformatics"],"title":"In silico prediction of blood-brain barrier permeation using the calculated molecular cross-sectional area as main parameter.","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/silico-prediction-bloodbrain-barrier-permeation-using-calculated-molecular-crosssectional-area-main"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7225261,"mean":6.3639010579516,"rank":1115136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6071686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7225261,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246387,"mean":8.1110560664973,"rank":47356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":198821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246387,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1294,"mean":3.8198546017015,"rank":230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1294,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":3.1614893617021,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
