The phenomenon has been defined as antianalgesia. The effects of dextro-naloxone or levo-naloxone on the attenuation of morphine-produced tail-flick inhibition induced by LPS were then studied. Pretreatment with dextro-naloxone or levo-naloxone reversed the attenuation of the morphine-produced tail-flick inhibition induced by LPS. Pretreatment with dextro-naloxone or levo-naloxone alone did not affect the morphine-produced tail-flick inhibition. It is concluded that dextro-naloxone and levo-naloxone block the LPS-induced antianalgesia against morphine antinociception via a non-opioid mechanism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002841","authors":["Wu, Hsiang\u2010En","Sun, Han\u2010Sen","Cheng, Caleb W.","Terashvili, Maia","Tseng, Leon F."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1460-9568.2006.05144.x","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T15:33:29+00:00","issns":["1460-9568"],"journal":"European Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1300287420,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1460-9568.2006.05144.x","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17100845"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1460-9568.2006.05144.x\/pdf","pmid":"17100845","pubdate":"2006-11-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"dextro-Naloxone or levo-naloxone reverses the attenuation of morphine antinociception induced by lipopolysaccharide in the mouse spinal cord via a non-opioid mechanism.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dextronaloxone-levonaloxone-reverses-attenuation-morphine-antinociception-induced-lipopolysaccharide"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":816297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97737,"mean":8.1640136285506,"rank":25381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97737,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1985,"mean":3.2410453629032,"rank":467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1985,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":3.03,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
