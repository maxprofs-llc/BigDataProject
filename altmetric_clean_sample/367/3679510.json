The isolate grew optimally with 0-2.0 % (w\/v) NaCl and at pH 6-7 and 30 degrees C. The predominant menaquinones were MK-12 and MK-11. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(17 : 0), anteiso-C(15 : 0) and iso-C(16 : 0). The major cell-wall sugars were galactose, mannose and rhamnose. The peptidoglycan amino acids of strain P27(T) were 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, alanine, glutamic acid and glycine. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and an unidentified glycolipid. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain P27(T) was 69.0 mol%. Based on its 16S rRNA gene sequence, strain P27(T) showed highest pairwise similarity with Agromyces cerinus subsp. cerinus JCM 9083(T) (97.0 % similarity). Based on phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic studies, strain P27(T) represents a novel species in the genus Agromyces, for which the name Agromyces atrinae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is P27(T) (=KCTC 19593(T) =JCM 15913(T)).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["Eun-Jin Park","Min-Soo Kim","Mi-Ja Jung","Seong Woon Roh","Ho-Won Chang","Kee-Sun Shin","Jin-Woo Bae"],"doi":"10.1099\/ijs.0.012294-0","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T20:40:33+00:00","issns":["1466-5034"],"journal":"International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1306554248,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1099\/ijs.0.012294-0"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ijs.sgmjournals.org\/content\/60\/5\/1056.full.pdf","pmid":"19666805","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Agromyces atrinae sp. nov., isolated from fermented seafood","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/agromyces-atrinae-sp-nov-isolated-fermented-seafood"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629536,"mean":4.93415564694,"rank":816435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629536,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97687,"mean":8.1604631984114,"rank":25364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97687,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1604,"mean":2.7367573300062,"rank":135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1604,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":0.90909090909091,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
