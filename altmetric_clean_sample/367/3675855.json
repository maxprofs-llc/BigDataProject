We tested whether this phenomenon also occurs in the Swedish sand lizard (Lacerta agilis). Females in a laboratory experiment preferred to associate with odour samples obtained from more distantly related males at the MHC class 1 loci. Data on free-ranging lizards suggest that associations between males and females are nonrandom with respect to MHC genotype. However, male spatial distribution and mobility during the mating season suggest that the non-random pairing process in the wild may also be driven by corresponding genetic benefits to males pairing with less related females.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a3","authors":["Mats Olsson","Thomas Madsen","Jessica Nordby","Erik Wapstra","Beata Ujvari","H\u00e5kan Wittsell","Olsson M","Madsen T","Nordby J","Wapstra E","Ujvari B","Wittsell H","M.
