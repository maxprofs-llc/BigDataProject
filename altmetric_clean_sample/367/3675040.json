The scale is sessile and feeds on Kunzea shrubs (Myrtales: Myrtaceae). If stressed, the thrips produce droplets of secretions. The mixture contains pentadecane, tridecane, two monoterpenoids, hexadecyl butanoate, and smaller amounts of 15 other esters of long-chain unbranched alcohols identified as acetates, butanoates, hexanoates, and octanoates. The monoterpenoids are dolichodial, an iridoid, and an unknown substance with a mass spectrum very similar to that of anisomorphal and peruphasmal, diastereomers of dolichodial, but with a different retention time. Iridoids, butanoates, hexanoates, and octanoates have not been previously identified in Thysanoptera.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cea","authors":["Gunther Tschuch","Peter Lindemann","Gerald Moritz"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10886-008-9494-3","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T18:11:23+00:00","issns":["1573-1561"],"journal":"Journal of Chemical Ecology","last_mentioned_on":1401756339,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10886-008-9494-3"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10886-008-9494-3.pdf","pmid":"18506530","pubdate":"2008-05-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agriculture","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Microscopy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Entomology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","environmentalhealth"],"title":"An Unexpected Mixture of Substances in the Defensive Secretions of the Tubuliferan Thrips, Callococcithrips fuscipennis (Moulton)","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unexpected-mixture-substances-defensive-secretions-tubuliferan-thrips-callococcithrips-fuscipennis-m"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3838271,"mean":5.0358987365702,"rank":881404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2425599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3838271,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125279,"mean":9.0957252989354,"rank":37591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":86238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125279,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":414,"mean":3.5756222760291,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":414,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":13.335,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
