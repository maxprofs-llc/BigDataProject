In Exp. 1 the VFF of 40 undergraduate students, 20 men and 20 women, whose mean age was 22.5 yr., was measured in nonfasting conditions 1 to 2 weeks before and in fasting conditions during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. In Exp. 2 the VFF of a comparable group of 15 men and 15 women, whose mean age was 23.2 yr., was measured in a different month in both fasting and nonfasting conditions. Subjects were assigned randomly to these two conditions. Analysis shows that fasting reduced VFF significantly in both experiments. This finding indicates that fasting is likely to reduce perceptual sensitivity. The results were explained in terms of fatigue and physical exhaustion effects produced by fasting.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032c0","authors":["Ali, M R","Amir, T"],"doi":"10.2466\/pms.1989.69.2.627","endpage":"631","first_seen_on":"2016-06-30T12:43:42+00:00","issns":["0031-5125","1558-688X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Perceptual & Motor Skills","last_mentioned_on":1467222359,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2813011"],"pmid":"2813011","pubdate":"1989-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"627","subjects":["psychophysiology","psychology"],"title":"EFFECTS OF FASTING ON VISUAL FLICKER FUSION","type":"article","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-fasting-visual-flicker-fusion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7965219,"mean":6.7280072798953,"rank":1004866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":6938342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7965219,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260797,"mean":11.543276415282,"rank":46762,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":213586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260797,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1204,"mean":5.4610224438903,"rank":162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":1030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1204,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":3.688125,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
