The aim of this study was to assess, using the 15D HRQoL instrument, HRQoL in a sample of 1528 chronic pain patients, referred to the multidisciplinary pain clinic of the Helsinki University Hospital in 2004-2012. The 15D results of the chronic pain patients were compared with those of a matched general population. To analyze the properties of the 15D, the results were compared with the preadmission questionnaire of the pain clinic, containing questions about background factors, aspects of the pain and its impact on life.The mean 15D score of the chronic pain patients was one of the lowest reported using 15D; 0.710 vs. 0.922 in the general population. It equalled the score of andvanced cancer patients in palliative care. The 15D scores were normally distributed, and 15D showed both statistically and clinically significant discriminative power in pain-related background factors. VAS on pain intensity, VAS on pain-related distress, and the impact of pain on daily life correlated well with the 15D score. Pain intensity did not have independent predictive value on the score.The results indicate heavy perceived burden of illness in chronic pain patients. In light of the questions analyzed, 15D appears sensitive and discriminative in chronic pain patients in tertiary care. Instead of pain intensity, the impaired HRQoL in chronic pain was mainly due to the psychosocial aspects of pain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003281","authors":["Vartiainen, Pekka","Heiskanen, Tarja","Sintonen, Harri","Roine, Risto P","Kalso, Eija","Roine, Risto P."],"doi":"10.1097\/j.pain.0000000000000641","endpage":"2276","first_seen_on":"2016-06-30T13:57:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-6623","0304-3959"],"issue":"10","journal":"Pain (03043959)","last_mentioned_on":1475059418,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27355183?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pain\/Abstract\/2016\/10000\/Health_related_quality_of_life_and_burden_of.16.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pain\/2016\/10000\/Health_related_quality_of_life_and_burden_of.16.pdf","pmid":"27355183","pubdate":"2016-06-30T22:00:33+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"2269","subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Health-related quality of life and burden of disease in chronic pain measured with the 15D instrument.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pain\/Fulltext\/2016\/10000\/Health_related_quality_of_life_and_burden_of.16.aspx","volume":"157","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/healthrelated-quality-life-burden-disease-chronic-pain-measured-15d-instrument-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":6105387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2037569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264654,"mean":11.725929817534,"rank":168246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":80781,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264654,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3319,"mean":9.7729264617239,"rank":2777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3319,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":20.8642,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
