We sought to assess whether a portable recording adaptor for the FN can enhance resident learning and improve patient management. The adaptor was used prospectively on consultations by first- and second-year ENT residents, and changes in diagnosis and management were recorded in the patient care workflow. In 43 patients, we found a 23% change in diagnosis, 44% change in management, and 19% change in surgical management after an attending reviewed recorded videos. Residents and attendings reported that discussing the video enhanced learning in 88% and 81% of cases, respectively. A portable FN recording adaptor has the potential to improve resident training and perhaps lead to more prompt health care delivery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c01","authors":["Y. F.
