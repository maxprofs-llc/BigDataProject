The additional diagnostic value compared to tracheal aspirations in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has been questioned. Nevertheless, BAL can provide extra information for the differential diagnosis of respiratory disease and good antibiotic stewardship. These benefits should outweigh potential hazards caused by the invasiveness of this diagnostic technique. The focus of the present study was on the clinical course and complications of patients following BAL procedures up to 24\u00a0h.\nHundred sixty-four FFB guided BAL procedures for suspected pneumonia were analysed in an observational study. The clinical course of patients was monitored by respiratory and haemodynamic data before BAL, 1 and 24\u00a0h after BAL. Complications were defined and registered. Factors associated with complications were analysed by logistic regression.\n\na decrease in average pO2\/FiO2 ratio 1\u00a0h after BAL from 29 kPa (218\u00a0mmHg) to 25 kPa (189\u00a0mmHg) (p\u2009<\u20090.05) was observed which fully recovered within 24\u00a0h. Respiratory complications: the incidence of procedure related hypo-oxygenation (SaO2\u2009\u2264\u200988\u00a0%) and\/or bronchospasm was 9\u00a0%; a decrease of >25\u00a0% PaO2\/FiO2 ratio 1\u00a0h after BAL was found in 29\u00a0% of patients; no bleeding or pneumothorax were registered. Haemodynamic complications: there were no cases of hypertension and cardiac rhythm disturbances; haemodynamic instability within the first 24\u00a0h after BAL was recorded in 22\u00a0%; this was correlated with a cardiovascular diagnosis at admission (OR 2.9; 95\u00a0% CI 1.2 - 6.7) and the presence of cardiovascular co-morbidity (OR 3.5; 95\u00a0% CI 1.5 - 8.3). The incidence of bacteraemia was 7\u00a0%. There was no case of procedure related death.\nFrequently occurring haemodynamic and respiratory instability but no cases of cardiac rhythm disturbances, bleeding, pneumothorax or procedure related death were attributable to diagnostic FFB and BAL. The procedures should be conducted under careful supervision by experienced physicians. Only a randomized controlled trial that compares diagnostic FFB and BAL with a non-invasive strategy could ultimately establish the safety profile and clinical utility of these procedures in critically ill ventilated patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d9","authors":["Schnabel, R M","van der Velden, K","Osinski, A","Rohde, G","Roekaerts, P M H J","Bergmans, D C J J"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12890-015-0104-1","first_seen_on":"2016-06-30T04:57:22+00:00","issns":["1471-2466"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Pulmonary Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1467330524,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26420333?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26420333"],"pmid":"26420333","pubdate":"2015-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pneumology\/Respiratory System","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Clinical course and complications following diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavage in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-course-complications-following-diagnostic-bronchoalveolar-lavage-critically-ill-mechanicall-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7971101,"mean":6.7313029448827,"rank":3294200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4626298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7971101,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260848,"mean":11.544439046644,"rank":98566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":159567,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260848,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":631,"mean":4.2010031746032,"rank":208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":631,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":17.278,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
