Seventy-six suspected cases and 118 controls were enrolled into an unmatched case-control study to identify risk factors for symptomatic illness during the outbreak. A suspected case was fever or history of fever, from April 2012, in a resident of the rehabilitation center. In total, 199 suspected cases from a population of 1,910 male youth (attack rate = 10.4%) with seven deaths (case fatality rate = 3.5%) were reported. After multivariate analysis, history of seeing lice in clothing (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-5.8), delayed (\u2265 2 days) washing of clothing (aOR = 4.0, 95% CI = 1.6-9.6), and delayed (\u2265 1 month) washing of beddings (aOR = 4.6, 95% CI = 2.0-11) were associated with illness, whereas having stayed in the rehabilitation camp for \u2265 6 months was protective (aOR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.10-0.40). Stronger surveillance and improvements in hygiene could prevent future outbreaks.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006990","authors":["Umulisa, Irenee","Omolo, Jared","Muldoon, Katherine A","Condo, Jeannine","Habiyaremye, Francois","Uwimana, Jean Marie","Muhimpundu, Marie Aimee","Galgalo, Tura","Rwunganira, Samuel","Dahourou, Anicet G","Tongren, Eric","Koama, Jean Baptiste","McQuiston, Jennifer","Raghunathan, Pratima L","Massung, Robert","Gatei, Wangeci","Boer, Kimberly","Nyatanyi, Thierry","Mills, Edward J","Binagwaho, Agnes","Condo, Jeanine","I.
