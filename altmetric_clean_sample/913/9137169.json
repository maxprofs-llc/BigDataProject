We used Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the potential intake dose of both pollutants.\nDuring the slash-and-burn periods, O3 and PM2.5 concentrations reached 119.4 \u00b5g\/m3 and 51.1 \u00b5g\/m3, respectively. The schoolchildren incorporated medium potential doses regarding exposure to O3 (2.83 \u03bcg\/kg.day, 95%CI 2.72-2.94). For exposure to PM2.5, we did not find toxicological risk (0.93 \u03bcg\/kg.day, 95%CI 0.86-0.99). The toxicological risk for exposure to O3 was greater than 1 for all children (QR = 2.75; 95%CI 2.64-2.86).\nSchoolchildren were exposed to high doses of O3 during the dry season of the region. This posed a toxicological risk, especially to those who had previous diseases.","authors":["Silva, P\u00e3mela Rodrigues de Souza","Ignotti, Eliane","Oliveira, Beatriz F\u00e1tima Alves de","Junger, Washington Leite","Morais, Fernando","Artaxo, Paulo","Hacon, Sandra"],"doi":"10.1590\/s1518-8787.2016050005667","first_seen_on":"2016-06-30T11:50:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1518-8787"],"journal":"Revista de sau\u0301de pu\u0301blica","last_mentioned_on":1467052637,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1590\/S1518-8787.2016050005667"],"pmcid":"PMC4902659","pmid":"27305405","pubdate":"2016-06-30T22:18:42+00:00","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"High risk of respiratory diseases in children in the fire period in Western Amazon.","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-risk-respiratory-diseases-children-fire-period-western-amazon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Alto risco de doen\u00e7as respirat\u00f3rias em crian\u00e7as no per\u00edodo de inc\u00eandios na Amaz\u00f4nia","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1771436159736075&id=1529740143905679","license":"public","citation_ids":[9137169],"posted_on":"2016-06-27T18:37:17+00:00","summary":"Crian\u00e7as residentes em \u00e1reas de inc\u00eandio na Amaz\u00f4nia brasileira inalam elevadas doses de poluentes aumentando assim o risco de doen\u00e7as respirat\u00f3rias.
