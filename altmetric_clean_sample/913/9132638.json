HBV-X protein (HBx) contributes to the biology and pathogenesis of HBV via stimulating virus replication or altering host gene expression related to HCC. The HBV X region contains only 465 bp encoding the 16.5 kDa HBx protein, which also contains several critical cis-elements such as enhancer II, the core promoter and the microRNA-binding region. Thus, mutations in this region may affect not only the HBx open reading frame but also the overlapped cis-elements. Recently, several types of HBx mutations significantly associated with clinical severity have been described, although the functional mechanism in most of these cases remains unsolved. This review article will mainly focus on the HBx mutations proven to be significantly related to clinical severity via epidemiological studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d0f","authors":["Kim, Hong","Lee, Seoung-Ae","Kim, Bum-Joon"],"doi":"10.3748\/wjg.v22.i24.5467","first_seen_on":"2016-06-30T05:56:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2219-2840"],"issue":"24","journal":"World Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1467265153,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27350725?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4917607","pmid":"27350725","pubdate":"2016-06-30T22:02:31+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"X region mutations of hepatitis B virus related to clinical severity.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/x-region-mutations-hepatitis-b-virus-related-clinical-severity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7971101,"mean":6.7313029448827,"rank":6897981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7971101,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260847,"mean":11.544623425316,"rank":218847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260847,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3567,"mean":2.935668536175,"rank":2462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3567,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.8675294117647,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
