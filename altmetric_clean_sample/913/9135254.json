Long-term fertilization treatments including chemical fertilizer (NPK), NPK plus manure (NPKM), and no fertilization over 23 years altered soil properties resulting in significant shifts in AOA and AOB community composition and abundance. NPK exhibited a strong influence on AOA and AOB composition while the addition of manure neutralized the community change induced by NPK. NPK also led to significant soil acidification and enrichment of Nitrosotalea. Nitrosospira cluster 9 and 3c were the most abundant AOB populations with opposing responses to fertilization treatments. NPKM had the largest abundance of ammonia-oxidizers and highest potential nitrification activity (PNA), suggesting high N loss potential due to a doubling of nutrient input compared to NPK. PNA was strongly correlated to AOA and AOB community composition indicating that both were important in ammonium oxidization in this Mollisol soil. Total N and organic C were the most important factors driving shifts in AOA and AOB community composition. The AOA community was strongly correlated to the activities of all sugar hydrolysis associated soil enzymes and was more responsive to C and N input than AOB.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Chao Xue","Xu Zhang","Chen Zhu","Jun Zhao","Ping Zhu","Chang Peng","Ning Ling","Qirong Shen","Xue, Chao","Zhang, Xu","Zhu, Chen","Zhao, Jun","Zhu, Ping","Peng, Chang","Ling, Ning","Shen, Qirong"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep28981","first_seen_on":"2016-06-30T09:44:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1467367326,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep28981?WT.feed_name=subjects_climate-sciences","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep28981","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27356769?dopt=Abstract&http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/erss.cgi?rss_guid=12auu1PYsGCNpo6akauPh2r5KY5WDOs2B1hbPBXflIdOhD8YA8","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27356769?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pmcid":"PMC4928058","pmid":"27356769","pubdate":"2016-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Element cycles","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Microbial ecology","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Quantitative and compositional responses of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria to long-term field fertilization","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-compositional-responses-ammoniaoxidizing-archaea-bacteria-longterm-field-fertilization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7974292,"mean":6.7330879653071,"rank":5760073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1929341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7974292,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260902,"mean":11.543333402325,"rank":167837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":77958,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260902,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32205,"mean":14.920431188672,"rank":22054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":8579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32205,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3311,"mean":16.804482779456,"rank":2234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":924,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3311,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
