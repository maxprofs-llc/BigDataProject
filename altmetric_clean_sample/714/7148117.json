There is no consensus about the etiology of LBWC and many cases with abnormal facial cleft do not meet the requirements for the true complex. We describe a series of four patients with LBWC and other malformations in an attempt to explain their etiology. There are several reports of fetuses with LBWC and absent gallbladder and one of our patients also had polysplenia. Absent gallbladder and polysplenia are associated with laterality genes including HOX, bFGF, transforming growth factor beta\/activins\/BMP4, WNT 1-8, and SHH. We postulate that this severe malformation may be due to abnormal genes involved in laterality and caudal development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5253cf058f610003c7a","authors":["Gajzer, David C","Hirzel, Alicia Cristina","Saigal, Gaurav","Rojas, Claudia Patricia","Rodriguez, Maria Matilde"],"doi":"10.3109\/15513815.2015.1055021","endpage":"270","first_seen_on":"2016-05-04T20:04:01+00:00","issns":["1551-3823","1551-3815"],"issue":"4","journal":"Fetal & Pediatric Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1462392221,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26111189?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26111189","pubdate":"2015-06-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"257","subjects":["pathology","pediatrics"],"title":"Possible Genetic Origin of Limb-Body Wall Complex","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/possible-genetic-origin-limbbody-wall-complex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7651252,"mean":6.5763358914726,"rank":3959574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2148467,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7651252,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266364,"mean":11.378112673306,"rank":144687,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":95414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266364,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":1.4620253164557,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.84090909090909,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TC_papers\/statuses\/727951856257765377","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7148117],"posted_on":"2016-05-04T20:03:41+00:00","author":{"name":"TC_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507539334375829504\/IcPjrJI3_normal.jpeg","description":"Pubmed twitterbot: arealization OR patterning OR somatosensory OR thalamus OR thalamocortical OR cortical development","id_on_source":"TC_papers","tweeter_id":"2789910212","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":180},"tweet_id":"727951856257765377"}]}}
