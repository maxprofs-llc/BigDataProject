However, the tolerance to betablockers in patients hospitalized with acute heart failure should be evaluated. Objective To estimate the proportion of patients hospitalized with acute heart failure who can tolerate these agents in clinical practice and compare the clinical outcomes of patients who can and cannot tolerate treatment with beta-blockers. Setting Two reference hospitals in cardiology. Methods Retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients hospitalized for acute heart failure between September 2008 and May 2012. Population-based sample. During the study period, 325 patients were admitted consecutively, including 194 individuals with an acute heart failure diagnosis and systolic left ventricular dysfunction and ejection fraction \u226445\u00a0%, who were candidates for the initiation or continuation of beta-blockers. Main outcome measure The percentage of patients intolerant to beta-blockers and the clinical characteristics of patients. Results On admission, 61.8\u00a0% of patients were already using beta-blockers, and 73.2\u00a0% were using beta-blockers on discharge. During hospitalization, 85\u00a0% of patients used these agents for some period. The main reasons for not using betablockers were low cardiac output syndrome (24.4\u00a0%), bradycardia (24.4\u00a0%), severe hypotension or shock (17.8\u00a0%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (13.3\u00a0%). Patients who were intolerant or did not use a beta-blocker had a longer hospital stay (18.3 vs. 11.0\u00a0days; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), greater use of vasoactive drugs (41.5 vs. 16.3\u00a0%; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001, CI 1.80-7.35), sepsis and septic shock (RR\u00a0=\u00a03.02; CI 95\u00a0% 1.59-5.75), and higher mortality rate during hospitalization (22.6 vs. 2.9\u00a0%; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001; CI 3.05-32.26). Conclusion Beta-blockers could be used in 73.2\u00a0% of patients hospitalized for acute heart failure. Patients who can not tolerate BB presented a higher frequency of adverse clinical outcomes including frequency of sepsis, use of vasoactive drugs, average length of hospitalization, and death.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f610007852","authors":["Luiz Carlos Passos","M\u00e1rcio Galv\u00e3o Oliveira","Andre Rodrigues Duraes","Thiago Moreira Trindade","Andr\u00e9a Cristina Costa Barbosa","Passos, Luiz Carlos","Oliveira, M\u00e1rcio Galv\u00e3o","Duraes, Andre Rodrigues","Trindade, Thiago Moreira","Barbosa, Andr\u00e9a Cristina Costa"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11096-016-0265-x","first_seen_on":"2016-05-04T13:34:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2210-7711","2210-7703"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Clinical Pharmacy","last_mentioned_on":1467622260,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs11096-016-0265-x","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27138843"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11096-016-0265-x.pdf","pmid":"27138843","pubdate":"2016-04-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacy","scheme":"springer"}],"subjects":["pharmacy"],"title":"Initiation or maintenance of beta-blocker therapy in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/initiation-maintenance-betablocker-therapy-patients-hospitalized-acute-heart-failure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7987814,"mean":6.7359164730015,"rank":1094356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":6886092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7987814,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268991,"mean":11.41031020484,"rank":53374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":215244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268991,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":441,"mean":3.7184818181818,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":441,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":18.676470588235,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/kadsho\/statuses\/727851987211948032","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7142762],"posted_on":"2016-05-04T13:26:51+00:00","author":{"name":"\u9580\u6751\u5c06\u592a Hosp Pharmacist","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/778806726757748737\/QcGpyRcy_normal.jpg","description":"PIC(JSHP)\/IDCP(JSC)\/CNP(JSNP)\/\u85ac\u7269\u7642\u6cd5\u5c02\u9580\u85ac\u5264\u5e2b(JSPHCS) #PharmaceuticalCare, #ClinicalPharmacy, #DI, #Pharmacoepidemiology, #EBM, #AntimicrobialStewardship #ASP","id_on_source":"kadsho","tweeter_id":"168488514","geo":{"lt":43.06417,"ln":141.34694,"country":"JP"},"followers":2127},"tweet_id":"727851987211948032"}],"blogs":[{"title":"Beta-Blockers for Cocaine and other Stimulant Toxicity: Time to Retire an Old Dogma, or Do You Not Care?","url":"http:\/\/lifeinthefastlane.com\/beta-blockers-cocaine-stimulant-toxicity-time-retire-old-dogma-not-care\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[7142762,6397721,4861273,5029631,7632205,9233083,4983536,9233086,1090304,1867375,9233089,9120491,9120517,9120492,9233091,3209215,479397,9233095,2688767,3711494,6031428,9233102,9233105],"posted_on":"2016-07-04T08:51:00+00:00","summary":"Dogma: &ldquo;a belief or set of beliefs that is accepted by the members of a group without being questioned or doubted; a point of view or tenet put forth as authoritative without adequate grounds.&rdquo;\nYears ago I treated a university student who prese","author":{"name":"FOAM EM RSSFOAM EM RSS","url":"http:\/\/www.foamem.com\/","description":"Free Open Access Medical Education"}}]}}
