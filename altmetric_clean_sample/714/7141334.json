This report describes the case of a 53-year-old woman who sustained a lower lip avulsion injury, a comminuted mandibular parasymphyseal fracture, and a hyoid bone fracture secondary to a bicycle accident. Trauma workup included computed tomographic angiography of the head and neck, which did not show vascular injury. Despite successful revascularization of the lower lip, on postoperative day 11 the patient developed a large internal carotid artery dissection and middle cerebral artery stroke. This case highlights the importance of careful postoperative monitoring after high-energy facial trauma, particularly in the setting of vascular and bony injuries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a7d","authors":["Misra, Shantum","Hass, Corbett A","August, Meredith","Eberlin, Kyle R"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.joms.2015.09.013","endpage":"128","first_seen_on":"2016-05-04T11:53:00+00:00","issns":["1531-5053","02782391"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery (02782391)","last_mentioned_on":1462362520,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26435401?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26435401","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"123","subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Delayed Carotid Dissection Following Lower Lip Revascularization in the Setting of Hyoid Fracture\u2014A Case Report and Review of the Literature","type":"article","volume":"74","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/delayed-carotid-dissection-following-lower-lip-revascularization-setting-hyoid-fracture-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7651252,"mean":6.5763358914726,"rank":5787623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1029863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7651252,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266363,"mean":11.37826670471,"rank":186579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266363,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1162,"mean":3.2477829457364,"rank":747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1162,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":9.8556603773585,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
