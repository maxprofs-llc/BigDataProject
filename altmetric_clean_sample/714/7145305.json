Newer research is finding that stones are associated with several serious morbidities. Yet, few randomized clinical trials or high quality observational studies have assessed whether clinical interventions decrease the recurrence of kidney stones. Therefore, in this review we analyze the available evidence on medical expulsive therapy for ureteral stones; describe the evidence about non-pharmacological stone therapy including dietary modifications and citrus juice-based therapy; and discuss the efficacy of thiazide diuretics for the treatment of hypercalciuria in recurrent nephrolithiasis.","authors":["Pachaly, Maria Aparecida","Baena, Cristina Pellegrino","Carvalho, Mauricio de"],"doi":"10.5935\/0101-2800.20160015","first_seen_on":"2016-05-04T16:19:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2175-8239","0101-2800"],"issue":"1","journal":"Jornal brasileiro de nefrologia : 'orgao oficial de Sociedades Brasileira e Latino-Americana de Nefrologia","last_mentioned_on":1462555800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27049371"],"pmid":"27049371","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Therapy of nephrolithiasis: where is the evidence from clinical trials?","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/therapy-nephrolithiasis-evidence-clinical-trials"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.08},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
