In general, diagnostic investigation begins with radiography of the lumbar spine. In addition to the most common findings, radiologists can identify increased density of a vertebral body, referred to as ivory vertebra. The objective of this study was to describe the main diseases that can present with this radiologic sign, such as Hodgkin lymphoma, Paget's disease, metastatic prostate cancer, breast cancer, and osteomyelitis. It is extremely important that radiologists be aware of this finding in order to inform the requesting physician of the possible etiologies, given that it can be the initial radiologic presentation for these diseases.","altmetric_jid":"56a768e32a83eeb12a8b4aed","authors":["Braun, Richard Andreas","Milito, Carlos Felipe do Rego Barros","Goldman, Suzan Menasce","Fernandes, Eloy de \u00c1vila"],"doi":"10.1590\/0100-3984.2014.0103","first_seen_on":"2016-05-04T10:37:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0100-3984"],"issue":"2","journal":"Radiologia Brasileira","last_mentioned_on":1462358530,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27141135?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27141135","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Ivory vertebra: imaging findings in different diagnoses.","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ivory-vertebra-imaging-findings-different-diagnoses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7651252,"mean":6.5763358914726,"rank":6621402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7651252,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266363,"mean":11.378277404434,"rank":222911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266363,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":1.1220597014925,"rank":154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.4375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/727809156879523840","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7140385],"posted_on":"2016-05-04T10:36:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":727},"tweet_id":"727809156879523840"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/727810544917356544","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7140385],"posted_on":"2016-05-04T10:42:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":727},"tweet_id":"727810544917356544"}]}}
