However, the problems of an excessive use of antibiotics, e.\u2009g. resistance and long-term interference with intestinal microbiota, are forcing us to search for alternatives. The use of probiotics alone or in combination with immunotherapeutics, or the sole use of immunotherapeutics, are important treatment options, which are already routinely available in clinical practice. These therapies are focused on the pathomechanism of an infection and tackle the root cause of the problem. Phytotherapeutics or small molecules like mannose, which restricts the adherence of bacteria to the urothelium, are complementary approaches.The EAU guidelines recommend the following treatments for the long-term prevention of urinary tract infections:Oral and parenteral immunostimulants (StroVac(\u00ae)), local estrogen replacement and administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus reuteri.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006936","authors":["Bauer, H W","Bessler, W G"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0042-101846","first_seen_on":"2016-05-04T10:32:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1438-8820","0001-7868"],"journal":"Aktuelle Urologie","last_mentioned_on":1462365007,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27138235?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27138235","pubdate":"2016-05-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Nicht antibiotische Strategien zur Rezidivprophylaxe von unkomplizierten Harnwegsinfektionen der Frau","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nicht-antibiotische-strategien-zur-rezidivprophylaxe-von-unkomplizierten-harnwegsinfektionen-der-fra"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7651252,"mean":6.5763358914726,"rank":3959582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2148441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7651252,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266362,"mean":11.378290087513,"rank":144689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":95400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266362,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":1.959,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.83333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
