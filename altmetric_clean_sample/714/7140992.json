This inspired Kurt Schneider to distinguish two sorts of depressive illness, each conforming to aSt\u00f6rung(disorder) in different levels of Scheler's hierarchy. No other psychopathologist, except Stanghellini, gave the matter much attention. I believe that Scheler's theory is a rich source of insight into psychopathology, general and neuropsychiatric. I therefore give an account of Scheler's scheme, review its extant applications (Schneider's, Stanghellini's), and present suggestions as to its continuing potential relevance in a wide range of psychopathological conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4dd3cf058f610001bf1","authors":["J Cutting"],"doi":"10.1177\/0957154x16631693","endpage":"228","first_seen_on":"2016-05-04T11:18:20+00:00","issns":["0957-154X","1740-2360"],"issue":"2","journal":"History of Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1462360684,"links":["http:\/\/hpy.sagepub.com\/content\/27\/2\/220.abstract?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hpy.sagepub.com\/content\/27\/2\/220.full.pdf","pmid":"27006123","pubdate":"2016-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Literary Studies","scheme":"era"},{"name":"History And Philosophy Of Specific Fields","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"220","subjects":["psychiatry","historyofmedicine"],"title":"Max Schelers theory of the hierarchy of values and emotions and its relevance to current psychopathology","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/max-schelers-theory-hierarchy-values-emotions-relevance-current-psychopathology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7651252,"mean":6.5763358914726,"rank":6621403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7651252,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266362,"mean":11.378317306212,"rank":222911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266362,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":381,"mean":3.1234421052632,"rank":319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":381,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.2807692307692,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
