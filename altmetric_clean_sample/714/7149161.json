Patients usually develop lymphadenopathy and fever but in rare cases (1%-2%) neuro-retinitis can occur.\nA 26-year-old woman with no known past medical history presented with left eye pressure, blurry vision, and headache for seven days. Symptoms started after she woke up with a left sided, non-radiating, pressure-like headache rated as 8\/10. She described not being able to focus and having blindness in her left eye. She was evaluated by the ophthalmology department who diagnosed her with having papilledema. The differential diagnosis included neuro-retinitis, optic neuritis, or intercebral hemorrhage (ICH). On physical exam she had no lymphadenopathy. However her left eye had central blindness without peripheral vision compromise. On dilated fundus exam (DFE) she had striae and diffuse grade III optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) edema. Laboratory tests were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar puncture were normal. After inquiring more about the patient's social history it was discovered that she was scratched by cat several earlier. This additional information made neuro-retinitis the top differential diagnosis. The Bartonella hensalae IgG returned positive and she was started on steroids along with double strength sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim due to a doxycycline allergy. Her symptoms almost resolved during her 3 day hospital course. Two weeks later, the ophthalmology department noted that her papilledema had resolved, and her vision was back to baseline.\nDisease manifestations from Bartonella hensalae result from either local infection like lymphadenopathy or from blood borne disseminated infection such as occurs with neuro-retinitis. Following inoculation, invasion of endothelial cells causes an acute inflammatory reaction associated with activation of pro-inflammatory cascade. Retinal findings may include hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, multiple discrete lesions in deep retina and stellar macular exudates (known as macular star) which may take 1-4 weeks to develop. As demonstrated in our case, the diagnosis is frequently more challenging than the treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007ed3","authors":["Ahmed Md, S","Daberkow Md, D","Eschete Md, M"],"first_seen_on":"2016-05-04T21:32:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0024-6921"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of the Louisiana State Medical Society","last_mentioned_on":1462984267,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27138397","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27138397\/?i=2&from=bartonella"],"pmid":"27138397","pubdate":"2016-05-04T22:01:21+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Cat Got Your Eye?","type":"article","volume":"167"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7684314,"mean":6.5948576928038,"rank":3522208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3988612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7684314,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266675,"mean":11.380491498983,"rank":121796,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":136208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266675,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":1.4291182795699,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.47222222222222,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/desmoda1\/statuses\/727974210677563392","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7149161],"posted_on":"2016-05-04T21:32:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Des Moda","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/760461974572523520\/Fasnw4J6_normal.jpg","description":"Main interests:  INSTITUTE OF PARASITOLOGY  Biology Centre CAS,   Tick-borne microbes, Epidemiology.\nMy position: Observer\/Reader.","id_on_source":"desmoda1","tweeter_id":"2740120112","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":226},"tweet_id":"727974210677563392"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Bartonella\/statuses\/730012148760514560","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7149161],"posted_on":"2016-05-10T12:30:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Galaxy Diagnostics","url":"http:\/\/www.galaxydx.com\/web","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2709308221\/e7b27fbcba3d88aa2a011edb5a959316_normal.jpeg","description":"Galaxy Diagnostics offers the most sensitive test for Cat Scratch Disease and other Bartonella spp infections.","id_on_source":"Bartonella","tweeter_id":"146188728","geo":{"lt":35.50069,"ln":-80.00032,"country":"US"},"followers":647},"tweet_id":"730012148760514560"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/alabamalyme\/statuses\/730013092185247744","license":"gnip","rt":["Bartonella"],"citation_ids":[7149161],"posted_on":"2016-05-10T12:34:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Alabama Lyme Disease","url":"http:\/\/alabamalymedisease.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/511181184756219905\/zO7DFpQk_normal.jpeg","description":"Lyme disease can masquerade as a host of psychiatric ills, confounding doctors and driving patients to question their very sanity.","id_on_source":"alabamalyme","tweeter_id":"2809694660","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":525},"tweet_id":"730013092185247744"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Bartonella\/statuses\/730435076719312896","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7149161],"posted_on":"2016-05-11T16:31:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Galaxy Diagnostics","url":"http:\/\/www.galaxydx.com\/web","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2709308221\/e7b27fbcba3d88aa2a011edb5a959316_normal.jpeg","description":"Galaxy Diagnostics offers the most sensitive test for Cat Scratch Disease and other Bartonella spp infections.","id_on_source":"Bartonella","tweeter_id":"146188728","geo":{"lt":35.50069,"ln":-80.00032,"country":"US"},"followers":647},"tweet_id":"730435076719312896"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Cat Got Your Eye? - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1016008611787843&id=533013680087341","license":"public","citation_ids":[7149161],"posted_on":"2016-05-04T14:37:03+00:00","summary":"Cat Got Your Eye?\n\nAhmed Md S, et al.
