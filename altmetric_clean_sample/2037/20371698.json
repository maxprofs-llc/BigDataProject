The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of two different treatments on the bacterial diversity of parsley: (i) coating with a pectin-EDTA solution containing the circular bacteriocin enterocin AS-48, and (ii) treatment by high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) at 600MPa for 8min. Control and treated parsley were stored in trays at 5\u00b0C for 10days. Both treatments reduced viable counts by 3.7 log cycles and retarded growth of survivors during storage. The bacterial diversity of the chopped parsley was studied by high throughput sequencing (Illumina Miseq). Bacterial diversity of control samples mainly consists of Proteobacteria (96.87%) belonging to genera Pseudomonas (69.12%), Rheinheimera (8.56%) and Pantoea (6.91%) among others. During storage, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (mainly Flavobacterium and Sphingobacterium) increased to 26.66%. Application of the pectin-bacteriocin-EDTA coating reduced the relative abundance of Proteobacteria (63.75%) and increased that of Firmicutes (34.70%). However, the relative abundances of certain groups such as Salmonella, Shigella and Acinetobacter increased at early storage times. Late storage was characterized by an increase in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, mainly Pseudomonas. Upon application of HHP treatment, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was reduced (85.88%) while Actinobacteria increased (8.01%). During early storage of HHP-treated samples, the relative abundance of Firmicutes increased. Potentially-pathogenic bacteria (Shigella) only increased in relative abundance by the end of storage. Results of the present study indicate that the two treatments had different effects on the bacterial diversity of parsley. The HHP treatment provided a safer product, since no potentially-pathogenic bacteria were detected until the end of the storage period.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028fa","authors":["Mar\u00eda Jose Grande Burgos","Mar\u00eda del Carmen L\u00f3pez Aguayo","Rub\u00e9n P\u00e9rez Pulido","Antonio Galvez","Rosario Lucas","Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Grande Burgos"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.foodres.2017.05.011","first_seen_on":"2017-05-22T02:29:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["09639969","1873-7145"],"issue":"Pt 1","journal":"Food Research International","last_mentioned_on":1502306648,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S096399691730203X","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28784551?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28784551","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Analysis of the microbiota of refrigerated chopped parsley after treatments with a coating containing enterocin AS-48 or by high-hydrostatic pressure","type":"article","volume":"99"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.33,"score_history":{"1y":8.33,"6m":8.33,"3m":1.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.33},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8348788,"mean":7.0413328717018,"rank":1067264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7279619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8348788,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241797,"mean":12.53770012738,"rank":45197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":196480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241797,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":688,"mean":6.1368296943231,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":605,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":688,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":14.225814814815,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"May 21, 2017","url":"https:\/\/microbiomedigest.com\/2017\/05\/21\/may-21-2017\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[19998961,20371680,20371681,20320709,20371682,20326543,20252623,20300109,20182706,20371683,20321231,20321624,20371685,20320400,20320203,18778786,18695807,20320331,20326460,20371686,20371687,20321307,20326507,20320995,20320737,20254466,20320221,20371688,20371689,20371690,20328602,20371691,17151224,20329437,20255600,20295840,20299239,20371692,20167803,20104957,20191711,20393123,20371694,20371695,20371697,20371698,20371700,20328488,20371702,20371703,20252180,20371710],"posted_on":"2017-05-21T22:36:00+00:00","summary":"Events and jobs FULLY FUNDED POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW POSITION TO STUDY MICROBIOME-BEHAVIOR INTERACTIONS: PORTUGAL General microbiome Bioinorganic antimicrobial strategies in the resistance era &ndash; Regiel-Futyra et al, Coordination Chemistry Reviews Biofilm","author":{"name":"Microbiome Digest - Bik's Picks","url":"http:\/\/www.microbiomedigest.com\/","description":"A daily digest of scientific microbiome papers, by your Microbe Manager Elisabeth Bik, laboratory of David Relman, Stanford University - Twitter: @microbiomdigest"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MicrobiomePaper\/statuses\/895339949498683392","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20371698],"posted_on":"2017-08-09T17:44:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Microbiome Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585212126173732865\/jEvg1KpB_normal.jpg","description":"The latest PubMed publications on Microbiome Research delivered direct to your Twitter Feed.
