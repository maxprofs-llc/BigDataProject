The clicks might be explained by a disruption of fluid or mucus films covering the mucosa. As in our tests clicks could be recorded regularly, they might potentially be used as indicators in a new tube function test, which has to be elaborated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f61000841d","authors":["Ehrt, Karsten","Fischer, Hans-Georg","Dahl, R\u00fcdiger","Punke, Christoph","Ovari, Attila","Pau, Hans Wilhelm"],"doi":"10.1097\/mao.0000000000000973","first_seen_on":"2016-02-21T07:09:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1537-4505","1531-7129"],"issue":"4","journal":"Otology & Neurotology","last_mentioned_on":1463016740,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/otology-neurotology\/9000\/00000\/_Physiological__Ear_Clicking___Its_Origin_and.97415.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/otology-neurotology\/Abstract\/2016\/04000\/_Physiological__Ear_Clicking___Its_Origin_and.8.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/otology-neurotology\/9000\/00000\/_Physiological__Ear_Clicking___Its_Origin_and.97415.pdf","pmid":"26890044","pubdate":"2016-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["otolaryngology","neurology"],"title":"\"Physiological\" Ear Clicking:  Its Origin and Potential Usability as a Test Tool for the Eustachian Tube Function.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/otology-neurotology\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/_Physiological__Ear_Clicking___Its_Origin_and.97415.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physiological-ear-clicking-origin-potential-usability-test-tool-eustachian-tube-function"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7690167,"mean":6.5970334286619,"rank":6653282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7690167,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287424,"mean":10.487164548418,"rank":245835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287424,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2227,"mean":1.4370377358491,"rank":1405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2227,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":2.0664634146341,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OandNonline\/statuses\/701302644862619648","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5845982],"posted_on":"2016-02-21T07:09:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Otology&Neurotology","url":"http:\/\/otology-neurotology.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1858345629\/O_N_Cover_normal.jpg","description":"Otology & Neurotology publishes original articles relating to both clinical and basic science aspects of otology, neurotology, and cranial base surgery.","id_on_source":"OandNonline","tweeter_id":"400352625","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1033},"tweet_id":"701302644862619648"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OandNonline\/statuses\/712288512406462465","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5845982],"posted_on":"2016-03-22T14:43:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Otology&Neurotology","url":"http:\/\/otology-neurotology.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1858345629\/O_N_Cover_normal.jpg","description":"Otology & Neurotology publishes original articles relating to both clinical and basic science aspects of otology, neurotology, and cranial base surgery.","id_on_source":"OandNonline","tweeter_id":"400352625","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1033},"tweet_id":"712288512406462465"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OandNonline\/statuses\/730571277463756801","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5845982],"posted_on":"2016-05-12T01:32:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Otology&Neurotology","url":"http:\/\/otology-neurotology.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1858345629\/O_N_Cover_normal.jpg","description":"Otology & Neurotology publishes original articles relating to both clinical and basic science aspects of otology, neurotology, and cranial base surgery.","id_on_source":"OandNonline","tweeter_id":"400352625","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1033},"tweet_id":"730571277463756801"}]}}
