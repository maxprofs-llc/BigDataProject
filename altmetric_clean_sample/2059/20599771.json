Particularly disturbing are the childhood intoxications which may result from such paraoccupational exposure. Work clothes and shoes appear to be a common vehicle for hazard transport in recently reported cases as they were in the past, although other \"markers\" for potential paraoccupational exposure may be derived from case reviews. These include: poor workplace hygiene, occupational intoxications in adult workers, and the \"cottage industry\" phenomenon. These markers are reviewed in the context of recently reported cases and strategies are suggested to mitigate these easily preventable exposures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f6100064dc","authors":["McDiarmid, M A","Weaver, V"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-26T19:56:36+00:00","issns":["0271-3586"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Industrial Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1495829543,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/8352287\/"],"pmid":"8352287","pubdate":"1993-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["occupationalmedicine"],"title":"Fouling one's own nest revisited.","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fouling-ones-own-nest-revisited"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":6275924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1118279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238310,"mean":12.098900142252,"rank":167547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238310,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2077,"mean":5.7151666666667,"rank":1975,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2077,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":28.728125,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
