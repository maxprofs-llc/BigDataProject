Clinical guidelines are often considered best evidence in health care. The aim of this critical review was to assess the quality and recommendations of LBP guidelines using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument. Electronic databases were used to identify LBP guidelines published between 2000 and 2015. Nine guidelines were selected for review from a total of 17. Only five guidelines effectively addressed the AGREE scoring. On the basis of the appraisal and domain scores, only four guidelines were strongly recommended. Improved translation of research evidence from guidelines to clinical practice is needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008cfd","authors":["Chetty, Laran","Laran Chetty"],"doi":"10.1177\/2165079917702384","first_seen_on":"2017-05-26T19:26:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2165-0799","2165-0969"],"journal":"Workplace Health & Safety","last_mentioned_on":1498905618,"links":["http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/2165079917702384?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/2165079917702384"],"pmid":"28535709","pubdate":"2017-05-26T22:23:44+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","subjects":["nursing","occupationalmedicine"],"title":"A Critical Review of Low Back Pain Guidelines","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/critical-review-low-back-pain-guidelines"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.9,"score_history":{"1y":4.9,"6m":4.9,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":1730102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6717416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246164,"mean":12.61728885332,"rank":65053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":180894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246164,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157,"mean":2.8430512820513,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.11,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
