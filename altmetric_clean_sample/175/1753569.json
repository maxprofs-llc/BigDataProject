Only those patients admitted to the cerebrovascular hospital service within 36 hours of the onset of the first symptom were included. The neurological status of 39% was stable (unchanged) at the end of seven days; 35% of the patients gradually improved. Nineteen percent had a progressing neurological deficit from the onset which stabilized within 48 hours of onset. Six patients (3%) had a remitting-relapsing course during the first 36 hours. Eight patients (4%) had a significant late worsening, after 48 hours of stable or improving course. Mortality was 11% for the entire group. However, a high risk of death group was identified - the mortality was 41% for those patients who had any degree of decreased level of consciousness and hemiplegia at the time of admission.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005cfc","authors":["H J Jones","C H Millikan"],"doi":"10.1161\/01.str.7.1.64","first_seen_on":"2013-09-16T21:58:16+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1524-4628","0039-2499"],"issue":"1","journal":"Stroke","last_mentioned_on":1379368539,"links":["http:\/\/stroke.ahajournals.org\/content\/7\/1\/64.short?rss=1&ssource=mfr"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/stroke.ahajournals.org\/content\/7\/1\/64.full.pdf","pmid":"1258107","pubdate":"1976-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Temporal profile (clinical course) of acute carotid system cerebral infarction.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/temporal-profile-clinical-course-acute-vertebrobasilar-system-cerebral-infarction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3561801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88401,"mean":8.08986300905,"rank":70747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88401,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4228,"mean":5.7109420392713,"rank":3596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4228,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":3.1324324324324,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/StrokeAHA_ASA\/status\/379725291201253376","license":"public","citation_ids":[1753569],"posted_on":"2013-09-16T21:55:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Stroke AHA\/ASA","url":"http:\/\/stroke.ahajournals.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/660165179758542849\/LPox9mzx_normal.png","description":"Stroke publishes peer-reviewed research for academics & clinicians.
