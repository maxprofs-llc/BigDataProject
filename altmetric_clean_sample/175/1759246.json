Cell-sheet method has been used to transplant many functional cells; however, potential ischemia might limit cell survival. The omentum, which is known to have rich vasculature, is expected to be a source of blood supply. We hypothesized that transplantation of hiPS-CM cell sheets combined with an omentum flap may deliver a large number of functional hiPS-CMs with enhanced blood supply.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057f2","authors":["M.
