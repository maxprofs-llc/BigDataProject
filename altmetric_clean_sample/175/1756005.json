These changes have been largely attributed to reduced inhibition in the aged brain, and are thought to contribute to substantial hearing impairment in both humans and animals. Since many of these changes can be partially reversed with auditory training, it has been speculated that they might not be purely degenerative, but might rather represent negative plastic adjustments to noisy or distorted auditory signals reaching the brain. To test this hypothesis, we examined the impact of exposing young adult rats to 8 weeks of low-grade broadband noise on several aspects of A1 function and structure. We then characterized the same A1 elements in aging rats for comparison. We found that the impact of noise exposure on A1 tuning selectivity, temporal processing of auditory signal and responses to oddball tones was almost indistinguishable from the effect of natural aging. Moreover, noise exposure resulted in a reduction in the population of parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons and cortical myelin as previously documented in the aged group. Most of these changes reversed after returning the rats to a quiet environment. These results support the hypothesis that age-related changes in A1 have a strong activity-dependent component and indicate that the presence or absence of clear auditory input patterns might be a key factor in sustaining adult A1 function.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc1d","authors":["Brishna Kamal","Constance Holman","Etienne de Villers-Sidani"],"doi":"10.3389\/fnsys.2013.00052","first_seen_on":"2013-09-17T17:30:46+00:00","issns":["1662-5137"],"journal":"Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1379439009,"links":["http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fnsys.2013.00052\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/DownloadFile\/1\/80186\/65011\/1\/21\/fnsys-07-00052_pdf","pmid":"24062649","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Shaping the aging brain: role of auditory input patterns in the emergence of auditory cortical impairments","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shaping-aging-brain-role-auditory-input-patterns-emergence-auditory-cortical-impairments"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3561814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97929,"mean":7.7424320521202,"rank":78217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97929,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":537,"mean":6.5485708955224,"rank":454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":537,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":23.0884,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
