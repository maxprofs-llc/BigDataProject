Subjects practiced 60\u2009min\/day for 8 weeks and continued some daily practice for 6 months. Quantitative measures, assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 4 and 6 months, were of pain, impact, sleep, physical and mental functions, and practice time. Qualitative comments also were recorded. Compared to baselines, CFQ practice led to significant improvements in pain, impact, sleep, and physical function in the 13 subjects (65%) who completed the trial; changes were present at 8 weeks and were maintained for the 6-month trial duration. A highly motivated subgroup of N = 5, who practiced the most, had the best outcomes in terms of end symptomology, and qualitative comments indicated health benefits in other domains as well. Qualitative comments by the remaining N = 8 trial completers and N = 7 withdrawals indicate different experiences with the practice. This extension trial indicates that diligent CFQ practice over time produces significant health gains in fibromyalgia in a subset of individuals. Future studies will need to address factors that might predispose to favourable outcomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c64","authors":["Sawynok, Jana"],"doi":"10.1155\/2013\/726062","first_seen_on":"2013-09-14T12:26:25+00:00","issns":["1741-427X"],"journal":"Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)","last_mentioned_on":1452272353,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2013\/726062\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24069054?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24069054","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24069054\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3771469\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2013\/726062.pdf","pmid":"24069054","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Extension trial of qigong for fibromyalgia: a quantitative and qualitative study.","type":"article","volume":"2013","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extension-trial-qigong-fibromyalgia-quantitative-qualitative-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6920439,"mean":6.2148136513881,"rank":1492885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5399789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6920439,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129565,"mean":6.9114730635054,"rank":29568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":99458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129565,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3621,"mean":4.3564773480663,"rank":705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3621,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":27.607142857143,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
