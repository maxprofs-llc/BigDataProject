To realize this vision, industry and policymakers must base risk management decisions on sound scientific information about the environmental fate of eNM, their availability to receptor organisms (eg, uptake), and any resultant biological effects (eg, toxicity). To address this critical need, we developed a model-driven, data mining system called NEIMiner, to study nanomaterial environmental impact (NEI). NEIMiner consists of four components: NEI modeling framework, data integration, data management and access, and model building. The NEI modeling framework defines the scope of NEI modeling and the strategy of integrating NEI models to form a layered, comprehensive predictability. The data integration layer brings together heterogeneous data sources related to NEI via automatic web services and web scraping technologies. The data management and access layer reuses and extends a popular content management system (CMS), Drupal, and consists of modules that model the complex data structure for NEI-related bibliography and characterization data. The model building layer provides an advanced analysis capability for NEI data. Together, these components provide significant value to the process of aggregating and analyzing large-scale distributed NEI data. A prototype of the NEIMiner system is available at http:\/\/neiminer.i-a-i.com\/.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007966","authors":["Xiong Liu","Tang","Harper","Jeffery Steevens","Roger Xu","Tang K","Liu X","Harper SL","Steevens JA","Xu R"," Tang"," Harper"],"doi":"10.2147\/ijn.s40974","first_seen_on":"2013-09-18T03:33:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-2013","1176-9114"],"issue":"Suppl 1","journal":"International Journal of Nanomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1379680921,"links":["http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/neiminer-nanomaterial-environmental-impact-data-miner-peer-reviewed-article-IJN"],"pmcid":"PMC3790276","pmid":"24098076","pubdate":"2013-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"15","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"NEIMiner: nanomaterial environmental impact data miner","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/neiminer-nanomaterial-environmental-impact-data-miner-peer-reviewed-article-IJN","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neiminer-nanomaterial-environmental-impact-data-miner"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4680920,"mean":5.6987154988182,"rank":1872589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":2773995,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4680920,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99210,"mean":7.9832795411707,"rank":34100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":64293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99210,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1233,"mean":1.6975568181818,"rank":181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":1012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1233,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":2.2586595744681,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
