Faster sequencing and genotyping methods require strong bioinformatics tools to make sense of the vast amount of data generated by modern laboratories. Advances in genome sequencing and computational power to analyze the whole genome sequences will guide the diagnostics of future. In this chapter, an overview of some basic bioinformatics resources that are needed to study metabolic disorders are reviewed and some examples of bioinformatics analysis of human growth hormone gene, protein and structure are provided.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9143cf058f61000cd4a","authors":["Pandey, A.V."],"doi":"10.1159\/000341755","first_seen_on":"2013-09-16T09:43:04+00:00","issns":["1421-7082"],"journal":"Endocrine development","last_mentioned_on":1379324573,"links":["http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/Abstract\/341755"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/Pdf\/341755","pmid":"23182822","pubdate":"2012-11-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Karger Publishers","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Bioinformatics Tools and Databases for the Study of Human Growth Hormone","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bioinformatics-tools-databases-study-human-growth-hormone-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Developmental Biology of GH Secretion, Growth and Treatment - Bioinformatics Tools and Databases...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/709315662415286\/posts\/709335152413337","license":"public","citation_ids":[1752238],"posted_on":"2013-09-16T09:42:53+00:00","summary":"Article from lecture at 6th ESPE Advanced Seminar in Developmental Endocrinology.","author":{"name":"Pandey lab","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/709315662415286","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/709315662415286\/picture","id_on_source":"709315662415286"}}]}}
