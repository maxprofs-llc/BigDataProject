Intramuscular (IM) injection is a common route to administer medication. Microorganisms known to cause injection site abscess are Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli commonly, Atypical mycobacteria, Clostridium species rarely. Gas gangrene is a necrotic infection of soft tissue with high mortality, often necessitating amputation in order to control the infection. Here, presenting a case of gas gangrene in a 19-year-old healthy male, who developed a life-threatening infection after IM injection of sodium diclofenac. Prompt clinical diagnosis, laboratory support, and timely surgical intervention saved the patient's life.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610004035","authors":["Hemavathi Sathyanarayana","Leela Rani","R Rajendran","Pooja Sarmah"],"doi":"10.4103\/0974-2727.115924","first_seen_on":"2013-09-18T07:46:28+00:00","issns":["0974-2727"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Laboratory Physicians","last_mentioned_on":1379490365,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3758709\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3758709","pmid":"24014972","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"58","title":"Iatrogenic Infection of Clostridium welchii Following Intramuscular Injection of Sodium Diclofenac","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/iatrogenic-infection-clostridium-welchii-following-intramuscular-injection-sodium-diclofenac"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628118,"mean":4.9440792284301,"rank":2904630,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628118,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91895,"mean":7.6525940104905,"rank":73092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91895,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":0.79047619047619,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Environmental Science":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Iatrogenic Infection of Clostridium welchii Following Intramuscular Injection of Sodium Diclofenac","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/244445175595172\/posts\/626413800731639","license":"public","citation_ids":[1757331],"posted_on":"2013-09-18T07:46:05+00:00","summary":"Iatrogenic Infection of Clostridium welchii Following Intramuscular Injection of Sodium Diclofenac.\n\nJ Lab Physicians. 2013 Jan;5(1):58-9.\n\nSathyanarayana H, Rani L, Rajendran R, Sarmah P.\n\nDepartment of Microbiology, Sapthagiri Institute of Medical Scienc","author":{"name":"SIGN Moderator","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/244445175595172","facebook_wall_name":"SIGN Moderator","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/244445175595172\/picture","id_on_source":"244445175595172"}}]}}
