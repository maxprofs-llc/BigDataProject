This paper critically evaluates such claims. First, we examine the promises and limits of integrated HIV\/AIDS prevention and microfinance programs by examining the available evidence base. We then propose future research agendas and next steps that may help to clear current ambiguities about the potential for economic programs to contribute to HIV\/AIDS risk reduction efforts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056e0","authors":["Shari L.
