NMR investigations of an Am(nPrBTP)3(3+) complex with a (15)N labelled ligand showed that it exhibits large differences in (15)N chemical shift for coordinating N-atoms in comparison to both lanthanide(III) complexes and the free ligand. The temperature dependence of NMR chemical shifts observed for this complex indicates a weak paramagnetism. This fact and the observed large chemical shift for bound nitrogen atoms allow us to conclude that metal-ligand bonding in the reported Am(III) N-donor complex has a larger share of covalence than in lanthanide complexes. This may account for the observed selectivity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Christian Adam","Peter Kaden","Bj\u00c3\u00b6rn B.
