The diagnosis is generally made by histopathology because the clinical appearance is difficult to differentiate from other lesions. Dermoscopic features of IFK have not been established to date. Herein we describe the dermoscopic findings of 4 cases of IFK. Radial peripheral hairpin vessels surrounded by a whitish halo arranged around a central white-yellowish amorphous area were observed in 3 cases, and glomerular vessels were present in the central area of one of them. The fourth case also presented a central white amorphous area but showed arborizing vessels. Reflectance confocal microscopy (available in 1 case) revealed a broadened honeycomb pattern, epidermal projections and hairpin and glomerular vessels. To our knowledge this is the first case series describing the dermoscopic features of inverted follicular keratosis and the first confocal microscopy description of this entity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f6100070d4","authors":["M Armengot-Carbo","A Abrego","T Gonzalez","I Alarcon","L Alos","C Carrera","J Malvehy","S Puig"],"doi":"10.1159\/000351715","first_seen_on":"2013-09-15T16:45:42+00:00","issns":["1421-9832"],"journal":"Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1379980800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23988627\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1159\/000351715"],"pmid":"23988627","pubdate":"2013-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Inverted Follicular Keratosis: Dermoscopic and Reflectance Confocal Microscopic Features.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inverted-follicular-keratosis-dermoscopic-reflectance-confocal-microscopic-features"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1586910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2900251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95556,"mean":7.7463947464813,"rank":28432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":66484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95556,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":467,"mean":1.9464978540773,"rank":151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":467,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":0.52631578947368,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"PA":1}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/718090339","license":"public","citation_ids":[1751176],"posted_on":"2013-09-24T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["new_finding"],"f1000_score":"1"}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dregiraldo\/status\/379301364389937152","license":"public","rt":["ArianeAAB"],"citation_ids":[1751176],"posted_on":"2013-09-15T17:51:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Enrique J Giraldo Ho","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/721421447898533889\/f4OaAANd_normal.jpg","description":"Esposo y Padre.
