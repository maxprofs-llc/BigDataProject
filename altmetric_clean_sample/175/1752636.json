Direct electrospraying on highly porous melt electrospun scaffolds provides a reproducible scaffold coating throughout the entire architecture. The burst release of protein is significantly reduced due to the immobilization of microparticles on the surface of the scaffold and release mechanisms are dependent on protein-polymer interactions. The composite scaffolds have a positive biological effect in contact with precursor osteoblast cells up to 18 days in culture. The scaffold design achieved with the techniques presented here endorses these new composite scaffolds as promising templates for growth factor delivery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008093","authors":["Bock N","Woodruff MA","Steck R","Hutmacher DW","Farrugia BL","Dargaville TR","Bock, Nathalie","Woodruff, Maria A.","Steck, Roland","Hutmacher, Dietmar W.","Farrugia, Brooke L.","Dargaville, Tim R.","Nathalie Bock","Maria A.
