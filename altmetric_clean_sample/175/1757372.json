Despite this, palliative care may not be universally welcomed. Surveys over the last decade have suggested that the general public have a lack of knowledge and negative perceptions towards palliative care. A detailed and comprehensive understanding of public views is needed in order to target education and policy campaigns and to manage future needs, expectations and resourcing of end of life care. The aim of this study was to establish the current levels of awareness and attitudes towards palliative care among the general public in Northern Ireland.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d1","doi":"10.1186\/1472-684x-12-34","first_seen_on":"2013-09-18T08:20:49+00:00","issns":["1472-684X"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Palliative Care","last_mentioned_on":1388969413,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-684X\/12\/34\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-684X-12-34.pdf","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-684X\/12\/34"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-684X-12-34.pdf","pmid":"24044631","pubdate":"2013-09-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"34","title":"Public awareness and attitudes toward palliative care in Northern Ireland","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/public-awareness-attitudes-toward-palliative-care-northern-ireland-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":2080546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2872504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102905,"mean":7.8822898429607,"rank":37305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":63772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102905,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249,"mean":6.2323951612903,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":3.5333333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
