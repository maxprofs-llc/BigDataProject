We semi-quantitatively analysed the tissue specimens and compared histological findings to those in preoperative imaging.\nThe number of patients operated on was 19 (18.6%); 15 of them had lower-extremity intramuscular lesions. The histological pattern of 13 of these 15 lesions corresponded to angiomatosis of soft tissue (AST). All other lesions treated surgically were VMs. The histology of AST was distinctive but magnetic resonance imaging findings often overlapped with those of VM.\nAST is easily mixed with intramuscular VM. The differentiation of these two entities has therapeutic importance. We emphasize the role of histology in the differential diagnostics of intramuscular slow-flow vascular malformations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043cd","authors":["Johanna Aronniemi","Jouko Lohi","P\u00e4ivi Salminen","Pia Vuola","Kimmo Lappalainen","Anne Pitk\u00e4ranta","Johanna Pekkola"],"doi":"10.1177\/0268355516671463","first_seen_on":"2016-10-03T07:08:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1758-1125"],"journal":"Phlebology","last_mentioned_on":1475478106,"links":["http:\/\/m.phl.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/09\/29\/0268355516671463"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/phl.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/09\/29\/0268355516671463.full.pdf","pmid":"27688038","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Angiomatosis of soft tissue as an important differential diagnosis for intramuscular venous malformations.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/angiomatosis-soft-tissue-important-differential-diagnosis-intramuscular-venous-malformations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7474500,"mean":6.4836868429538,"rank":3849162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2092824,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7474500,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239893,"mean":12.525296950294,"rank":131498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":84117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239893,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301,"mean":2.7469933333333,"rank":159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.4892857142857,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"JP":1,"FI":2,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PhlebologyJourn\/statuses\/782838033951457280","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12389194],"posted_on":"2016-10-03T07:01:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Phlebology Journal","url":"http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/home\/phla","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/767444117840330752\/syDGKCmP_normal.jpg","description":"The Lead Phlebology Medical Journal","id_on_source":"PhlebologyJourn","tweeter_id":"767384457565405184","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":110},"tweet_id":"782838033951457280"}]}}
