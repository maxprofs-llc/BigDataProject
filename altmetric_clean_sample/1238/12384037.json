Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the corneal endothelial cells were conducted before CXL and 3, 6, and 12 months after CXL by using a specular microscope (Tomy EM-3000).\nThere was a significant reduction in endothelial cell count particularly at 3 and 6 months postCXL. In addition, the coefficient of variance was also statistically significantly higher at 3 and 6 months postoperatively than the preCXL value. There was a slight change in the percentage of hexagonal cells.\nThe use of accelerated CXL (10 mW\/cm(2) for 9 minutes) has a transient negative impact on endothelial cell density and\/or endothelial morphology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f15","authors":["Amani Badawi"],"doi":"10.2147\/opth.s113412","first_seen_on":"2016-10-02T23:10:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1177-5467"],"journal":"Clinical Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1475449793,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/corneal-endothelial-changes--after-accelerated-corneal-collagen-cross--peer-reviewed-article-OPTH"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=32718","pmid":"27757009","pubdate":"2016-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","title":"Corneal endothelial changes  after accelerated corneal collagen cross-linking in keratoconus and postLASIK ectasia","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/corneal-endothelial-changes-after-accelerated-corneal-collagen-crosslinking-keratoconus-postlasik-ec"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":6420441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1150523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253911,"mean":12.807431830176,"rank":177136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":46108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253911,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1308,"mean":2.7079127773527,"rank":760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1308,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":5.3028169014085,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
