Two groups of midlife women: a random sample (n = 381) and a sample of women who attended menopause seminars (n = 95) were asked to select from a list of 39 changes those they thought were directly caused by menopause. Information from readily available books written for a general audience was used to construct the marking guide for a \"commonly available knowledge\" score. A template for a \"biomedical\" knowledge score based on an estrogen deficiency perspective of menopause was derived from recently published academic medical literature. The mean score for the commonly available knowledge items was 27 out of 39 (69.2% correct). The mean biomedical knowledge score was lower, 19.3 out of 35 (55.1% correct). While the two groups of women were significantly different in terms of current and past hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use, we found no differences between them in the mean commonly available knowledge or biomedical knowledge scores. This finding challenges the widely held assumption that active information-seekers are more interested and have a better level of knowledge than the general population. The findings also suggest that women are less likely to accept a biomedical model of menopause and that they are using HRT for a multiplicity of reasons, not just those related to estrogen deficiency.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f61000170f","authors":["Fox-Young, S","Sheehan, M","O'Connor, V","Cragg, C","Del Mar, C"," Ms.   Stephanie   Fox-Young   BA and MEd and RN "," Mary   Sheehan   PhD "," Vivienne   O'Connor   FRACOG "," Carole   Cragg   BA and Dip Psych "," Chris   Del   Mar   FRACGP and FAFPHM ","Stephanie Fox-Young","Mary Sheehan","Vivienne O'Connor","Carole Cragg","Chris Del Mar"],"doi":"10.1300\/j013v29n02_03","endpage":"51","first_seen_on":"2016-02-21T12:49:16+00:00","issns":["0363-0242","1541-0331"],"issue":"2","journal":"Women &amp; Health","last_mentioned_on":1447286400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1300\/J013v29n02_03"],"pmid":"10427647","pubdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"37","subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Women's knowledge about the physical and emotional changes associated with menopause.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1300\/J013v29n02_03","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/womens-knowledge-about-physical-emotional-changes-associated-menopause"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7030920,"mean":6.2656066980691,"rank":1651997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4556095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7030920,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283150,"mean":10.296896637459,"rank":86941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":190903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283150,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282,"mean":3.5818790035587,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.1588235294118,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
