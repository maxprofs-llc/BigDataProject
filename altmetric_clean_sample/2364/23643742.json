Over the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that during neural development in mammals, distinct ontogenetic stage-specific BAF complexes derived from combinatorial assembly of their subunits are formed in neural progenitors and post-mitotic neural cells. Proper functioning of the BAF complexes plays critical roles in neural development, including the establishment and maintenance of neural fates and functionality. Indeed, recent human exome sequencing and genome-wide association studies have revealed that mutations in BAF complex subunits are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as Coffin-Siris syndrome, Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome, Kleefstra's syndrome spectrum, Hirschsprung's disease, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. In this review, we focus on the latest insights into the functions of BAF complexes during neural development and the plausible mechanistic basis of how mutations in known BAF subunits are associated with certain neurodevelopmental disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc11","authors":["Sokpor, Godwin","Xie, Yuanbin","Rosenbusch, Joachim","Tuoc, Tran","Godwin Sokpor","Yuanbin Xie","Joachim Rosenbusch","Tran Tuoc"],"doi":"10.3389\/fnmol.2017.00243","first_seen_on":"2017-08-12T00:00:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1662-5099"],"journal":"Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1503397865,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fnmol.2017.00243\/full?utm_source=S-TWT&utm_medium=SNET&utm_campaign=ECO_FNINS_XXXXXXXX_auto-dlvrit","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28824374?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5540894","pmid":"28824374","pubdate":"2017-08-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Chromatin Remodeling BAF (SWI\/SNF) Complexes in Neural Development and Disorders","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chromatin-remodeling-baf-swisnf-complexes-neural-development-disorders"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":2.85,"6m":2.85,"3m":2.85,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":3321774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5055898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206358,"mean":12.517948341951,"rank":68668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":136255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206358,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":723,"mean":4.2240720221607,"rank":196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":723,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":2.164367816092,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
