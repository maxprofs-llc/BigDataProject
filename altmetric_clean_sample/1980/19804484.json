From 2011 to 2014, there was marked stability in all indicators of the availability, utilization, and productivity of cardiology units. There was significant variability between units and between the health services of the autonomous communities. There was poor implementation of process management (only 14% of the units) and scarce development of health care networks (17%). Structured cardiology units tended to have better results, in terms of both quality and efficiency. No significant differences were found between the different types of unit in the mean length of stay (5.5\u00b11.1 days) or the ratio between successive and first consultations (2:1). The mean discharge rate was 5\/1000 inhabitants\/y and the mean rate of initial consultations was 16\u00b14\/1000 inhabitants\/y. No duty or on-call cardiologist was available in 30% of cardiology units with 24 or more beds; of these, no critical care beds were available in 45%. Our findings support the recommendation to regionalize cardiology care and to promote the development of cardiology unit networks.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6363cf058f6100087c0","authors":["Andr\u00e9s \u00cd\u00f1iguez Romo","Vicente Bertomeu Mart\u00ednez","Luis Rodr\u00edguez Padial","Manuel Anguita S\u00e1nchez","Francisco Ruiz Mateas","Rafael Hidalgo Urbano","Jos\u00e9 Luis Bernal Sobrino","Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez P\u00e9rez","Carlos Macaya de Miguel","Francisco Javier Elola Somoza"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.rec.2017.03.022","first_seen_on":"2017-05-03T10:16:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["18855857","1885-5857"],"journal":"Revista Espanola De Cardiologia","last_mentioned_on":1493806559,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28457812"],"pmid":"28457812","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"The RECALCAR Project.
