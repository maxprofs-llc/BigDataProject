MG patients presented with low quantitative MG scores (mean 0.5, SD 0.5) and without pathologic decrement. Fatigability was based on calculation of linear trend (LT) reflecting dynamic performance within subsequent constant time intervals. Perception of physical fatigue was analyzed using fatigue questionnaires.\nMG patients showed a negative LT in both AMT and 6MWT, significantly differing from stable performance in controls. LT inversely correlated with elevation of acetylcholine receptor antibodies (r= -0.59, P<0.005) but not quantitative MG score and fatigue perception.\nLT allows quantification of fatigability as an objective measurement of decline in individual performance, even in patients without obvious neuromuscular deficits in routine testing. The missing correlation of experienced fatigue supports the multidimensional fatigue model. This article is protected by copyright.
