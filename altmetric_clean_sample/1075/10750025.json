The aim of this case report was to monitor the effect of gastrostomy insertion and implementation of overnight supplemental feeding upon clinical outcomes, including body mass index (BMI), lung function (FEV1), and exercise-related variables (maximal oxygen uptake [VO2max] and ventilatory efficiency [VE\/VO2]) in an 11-year-old female with CF Combined incremental and supramaximal exercise testing to exhaustion was performed at four time points: 3\u00a0months prior to the procedure (T1), 2\u00a0days prior to (T2), 4\u00a0months (T3), and 1\u00a0year following the procedure (T4). Improvements following gastrostomy insertion were observed at the 1\u00a0year follow-up with regards to BMI (+20%); whereas absolute VO2max remained stable and lung function fluctuated throughout the period of observation. Declines in function with regards to body weight relative VO2max (-16.3%) and oxygen uptake efficiency (+7.5%) were observed during this period. This case report is the first to consider exercise-related clinical outcomes in assessing the effect of implementing gastrostomy feeding in CF The varied direction and magnitude of the associations between variables shows that further investigations are required.","altmetric_jid":"53222dc92a83ee27268b4594","authors":["Owen W.
