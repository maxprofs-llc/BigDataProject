Clinical information, FIGO stage and all previous cytological data were extracted from clinical and histopathological records. Proportional differences were assessed using chi-square tests. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Inter-observer agreement in cytology was checked by comparing concordance values using k-statistics.\nNo prior screening history was recorded in 60.7% of CC cases and its absence increased with age and advanced stage. Advanced stage (e.g., \u2265 II) at diagnosis was associated with age (>50 years) and adenocarcinoma (ADC) compared to younger women and those with a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). False negative smears were identified in 27.1% of women with CC (ADC 52.6% vs. SCC 16.2%, p<0.05).\nAbsence of prior screening history was common among CC cases. Organized actions to reduce \"under screening\" and the use of highly sensitive HPV-based tests could be useful strategies in reducing the burden of CC in Asturias.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Marta Castillo","Aurora Astudillo","Omar Clavero","Julio Velasco","Raquel Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez","Silvia de Sanjos\u00e9","Castillo, Marta","Astudillo, Aurora","Clavero, Omar","Velasco, Julio","Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, Raquel","de Sanjos\u00e9, Silvia"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0161403","first_seen_on":"2016-08-22T17:52:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1473834791,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0161403","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27547971"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0161403.PDF","pmid":"27547971","pubdate":"2016-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0161403","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Poor Cervical Cancer Screening Attendance and False Negatives.
