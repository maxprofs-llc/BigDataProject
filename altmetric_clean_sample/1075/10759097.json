We show here that, like Kinase Suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1), EPH (erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma) receptor B4 (EPHB4) is aberrantly overexpressed in human colon tumor cell lines and selectively required for their survival. KSR1 and EPHB4 support tumor cell survival by promoting the expression of downstream targets, Myc and the transcriptional coactivator Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1\u03b2 (PGC1\u03b2). While KSR1 promotes the aberrant expression of Myc and PGC1\u03b2 protein via a post-transcriptional mechanism, EPHB4 has a greater effect on Myc and PGC1\u03b2 expression via its ability to elevate mRNA levels. Subsequent analysis of the post-transcriptional regulation demonstrates that KSR1 promotes the translation of Myc protein. These findings reveal novel KSR1- and EPHB4-dependent signaling pathways supporting the survival of colorectal cancer cells through regulation of Myc and PGC1\u03b2, suggesting that inhibition of KSR1 or EPHB4 effectors may lead to selective toxicity in colorectal tumors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310d","authors":["Jamie L.
