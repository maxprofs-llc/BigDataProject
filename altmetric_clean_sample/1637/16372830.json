We investigated in a large cohort of patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) the effect of transfusion of 1-2 units of leucocyte-depleted RBCs on mortality and multiorgan failure.\nThe investigation included all patients from July 2009 to June 2014 who underwent CABG at our institution and received no (n = 1478) or 1-2 units of RBCs (n = 1528). The primary end-point was 30-day mortality; secondary end-points were major organ dysfunction. A subgroup analysis assessed the effect of the duration of RBC storage on patient outcome. Statistical analysis was performed using propensity score (PS) adjustment.\nThe 30-day mortality rate was 0.3% in the RBC- group and 0.2% in the RBC+ group. Compared with the RBC- group, PS-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 30-day mortality in the RBC+ group was 0.29 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.06-1.50; P = 0.14]. PS-adjusted OR of a 'prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay' (>48 h) was significantly higher in the RBC+ group than in the RBC- group [OR 1.49 (95% CI: 1.14-1.95); P = 0.004], but major clinical complications such as low cardiac output syndrome, stroke, haemofiltration, wound infection and prolonged mechanical ventilator support (>24 h) did not differ significantly between groups. Duration of blood storage was not independently associated with clinical outcome.\nOur data do not indicate a transfusion-related increase in mortality and multiorgan failure in patients undergoing isolated CABG.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002823","authors":["Koster, Andreas","Zittermann, Armin","B\u00f6rgermann, Jochen","Knabbe, Cornelius","Diekmann, J\u00fcrgen","Schirmer, Uwe","Gummert, Jan F."],"doi":"10.1093\/ejcts\/ezv252","first_seen_on":"2017-02-14T07:16:10+00:00","issns":["1010-7940","1873-734X"],"journal":"European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1486598400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/ejcts\/ezv252"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/ejcts\/article-pdf\/49\/3\/931\/7914875\/ezv252.pdf","pmid":"26201957","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","cardiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Transfusion of 1 and 2 units of red blood cells does not increase mortality and organ failure in patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/ejcts\/article-lookup\/doi\/10.1093\/ejcts\/ezv252","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transfusion-1-2-units-red-blood-cells-not-increase-mortality-organ-failure-patients-undergoing-isola-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8177609,"mean":6.9186386481167,"rank":4334465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2270699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8177609,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269409,"mean":12.936459570614,"rank":153747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":88962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269409,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1094,"mean":3.4666587374199,"rank":443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1094,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":3.65,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/725668259","license":"public","citation_ids":[16372830],"posted_on":"2017-02-09T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["new_finding"],"f1000_score":"1"}]}}
