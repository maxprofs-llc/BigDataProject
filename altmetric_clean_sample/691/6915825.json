Owing to its rarity, neither pathogenesis nor standard treatment is established for this orphan disease. Hence, we tried to treat a patient with MCL based on the exome and transcriptome sequencing results of the patient's own DNA and RNA.\nFirst, tumor DNA and RNA were extracted from bone marrow at the time of diagnosis. Germline DNA was extracted from the patient's saliva 45 days after induction chemotherapy and used as a control. Then, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) using the DNA and whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS) using the RNA. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were called using MuTect and GATK. Samtools, FusionMap, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were utilized to analyze WTS results.\nWES and WTS results revealed mutation in KIT S476I. Fusion analysis was performed using WTS data, which suggested a possible RAR\u03b1-B2M fusion. When RNA expression analysis was performed using WTS data, upregulation of PIK3\/AKT pathway, downstream of KIT and mTOR, was observed. Based on our WES and WTS results, we first administered all-trans retinoic acid, then dasatinib, and finally, an mTOR inhibitor.\nWe present a case of orphan disease where we used a targeted approach using WES and WTS data of the patient. Even though our treatment was not successful, use of our approach warrants further validation.","authors":["Youk, Jeonghwan","Koh, Youngil","Kim, Ji-Won","Kim, Dae-Yoon","Park, Hyunkyung","Jung, Woo June","Ahn, Kwang-Sung","Yun, Hongseok","Park, Inho","Sun, Choong-Hyun","Lee, Seungmook","Yoon, Sung-Soo"],"doi":"10.5045\/br.2016.51.1.17","first_seen_on":"2016-04-23T10:05:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2287-979X","2288-0011"],"issue":"1","journal":"Blood research","last_mentioned_on":1461416425,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27104187?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27104187"],"pmid":"27104187","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"17","title":"A scientific treatment approach for acute mast cell leukemia: using a strategy based on next-generation sequencing data","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/scientific-treatment-approach-acute-mast-cell-leukemia-using-strategy-based-nextgeneration-sequencin-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
