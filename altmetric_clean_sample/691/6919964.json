Cerebellar AM, AM binding sites and receptor components are altered during hypertension, suggesting a role for cerebellar AM in blood pressure regulation. Thus, we assessed the effect of valsartan, on AM and its receptor components expression in the cerebellar vermis of Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats. Additionally, we evaluated AM action on superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) production in cerebellar vermis. Animals were treated with valsartan or vehicle for 11\u00a0days. Rats were sacrificed by decapitation; cerebellar vermis was dissected; and AM, CRLR, RAMP1, RAMP2, and RAMP3 expression was quantified by Western blot analysis. CAT, SOD, and GPx activity was determined spectrophotometrically and blood pressure by non-invasive plethysmography. We demonstrate that AM and RAMP2 expression was lower in cerebellum of SHR rats, while CRLR, RAMP1, and RAMP3 expression was higher than those of WKY rats. AM reduced cerebellar CAT, SOD, GPx activities, and TBARS production in WKY rats, but not in SHR rats. Valsartan reduced blood pressure and reversed the altered expression of AM and its receptors components, as well the loss of AM capacity to reduce antioxidant enzyme activity and TBARS production in SHR rats. These findings demonstrate that valsartan is able to reverse the dysregulation of cerebellar adrenomedullinergic system; and they suggest that altered AM system in the cerebellum could represent the primary abnormality leading to hypertension.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024d5","authors":["Leticia Figueira","Anita Israel"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12311-016-0780-2","first_seen_on":"2016-04-23T12:51:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-4230","1473-4222"],"journal":"Cerebellum","last_mentioned_on":1500147400,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs12311-016-0780-2","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs12311-016-0780-2"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12311-016-0780-2.pdf","pmid":"27108271","pubdate":"2016-04-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Effect of Valsartan on Cerebellar Adrenomedullin System Dysregulation During Hypertension","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-valsartan-cerebellar-adrenomedullin-system-dysregulation-during-hypertension"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0.85,"6m":0.85,"3m":0.85,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8213597,"mean":6.9554318223036,"rank":4065282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4085087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8213597,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271115,"mean":11.519008070405,"rank":132647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":135872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271115,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":523,"mean":2.1641992337165,"rank":209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":523,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.9,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TheCerebellum\/statuses\/723855637722075137","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6919964],"posted_on":"2016-04-23T12:46:47+00:00","author":{"name":"The Cerebellum","url":"http:\/\/www.springer.com\/biomed\/neuroscience\/journal\/12311","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1452978153\/SpringerTw_orange_normal.jpg","description":"Tweets from the Editors of The Cerebellum, the official publication of the Society for Research on the Cerebellum, and its sister journal Cerebellum & Ataxias.","id_on_source":"TheCerebellum","tweeter_id":"159049238","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":363},"tweet_id":"723855637722075137"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/letifigueira\/statuses\/886308552075358208","license":"gnip","rt":["TheCerebellum"],"citation_ids":[6919964],"posted_on":"2017-07-15T19:36:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Leticia Figueira","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2532543434\/IMG00618-20110908-1259_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"letifigueira","tweeter_id":"151522627","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":248},"tweet_id":"886308552075358208"}]}}
