Most experience has been obtained with the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol.(1,5-7) However, recent studies suggest that atenolol - a selective \u03b21-adrenoreceptor blocker - may be equally effective, but with less side effects than propranolol.(2-4) Unfortunately, studies on atenolol are still scarce and have all been conducted in very small cohorts.(2-4) This article is protected by copyright.
