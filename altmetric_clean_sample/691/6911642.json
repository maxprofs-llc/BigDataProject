In infections serum levels of specific antibodies increase. However, for healthy subjects Wright held that antibodies contributed minimally to opsonic activity (the complement-enhanced phagocytosis of microorganisms). The activity was present in newborn serum, was increased in the acute phase of an immune response prior to antibody increase, and was less specific. Furthermore, defective opsonization was associated with undue susceptibility to certain infections, for which a genetic basis was later found. With the demonstrations of complement-mediated lysis both of normal cells by foreign (plant) lectins, and of foreign cells (microorganisms) by animal lectins, it now appears that endogenous lectins correspond to the heat-stable component of Wright's serum opsonic activity. His work leads to the lectin pathway of complement activation with specificities limited to the recognition of relatively immutable surface sugars - predictable pathogen characters that contrast with the less predictable targets of the adaptive immune system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5043cf058f6100030c1","authors":["Forsdyke, Donald
