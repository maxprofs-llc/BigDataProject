Vasomotor symptoms are the most commonly reported, but vaginal dryness\/dyspareunia, sleep difficulties and adverse mood changes have all been shown to worsen as women approach menopause. For postmenopausal women changes in cognition are more likely to be related to aging and not to hormones. This article reviews the symptoms of hot flashes (vasomotor symptoms), vaginal dryness\/dyspareunia, adverse mood, poor sleep\/insomnia, and cognitive complaints, describing their epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment. This article thus reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of these common menopausal symptoms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058be","authors":["Santoro, Nanette","Epperson, C Neill","Mathews, Sarah B","Nanette Santoro","C.
