Prevention in kindergartens with 500 ppm fluoride toothpaste-a randomized clinical trial."],"citation":{"abstract":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of an intensified preventive programme in kindergartens.\nTwo thousand two hundred twenty-eight 2- to 4-year-old children attending kindergartens in two counties in northern Hesse were randomly allocated to two groups. Children in the test group participated in daily tooth brushing with 500\u00a0ppm fluoride toothpaste, which was supervised by specially trained dental nurses. Children in the control group received tooth brushing instructions three to four times a year. Caries experience was recorded using WHO criteria. The basic survey was performed from October 2006 to April 2007, with the final examinations between March and July 2009. The statistical evaluation was performed by means of the software package SPSS 17.0. To compare the mean \u0394dmf values of the test and control groups, Mann-Whitney U tests were performed.\nTwo thousand one hundred twelve children (test group, 1096; control group, 1048) participated in the final examinations. The caries increment of the test group (\u0394dmf-s\u2009=\u20091.55) was 24\u00a0% lower than the increment of the control group (\u0394dmf-s\u2009=\u20092.02, p\u2009=\u20090.043). Based on \u0394dmf-t values, the corresponding figures were 0.79 for the test group and 1 for the control group (p\u2009=\u20090.44). High increment values (\u0394dmf-s >7) were observed in the control group twice as often as in the test group.\nThe results show that an intensified preventive programme in kindergartens, based on supervised daily tooth brushing, has a positive effect on the dental health of preschool children.\nIt is sufficient to offer such programmes in socially deprived areas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000256c","authors":["Pieper, Klaus","Winter, Julia","Krutisch, Martina","V\u00f6lkner-Stetefeld, Petra","Jablonski-Momeni, Anahita"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00784-015-1604-3","first_seen_on":"2016-05-25T14:28:45+00:00","issns":["1436-3771","1432-6981"],"journal":"Clinical Oral Investigations","last_mentioned_on":1464247452,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26395351","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26395351\/?i=10&from=500%20ppm%20fluoride#fft"],"pmid":"26395351","pubdate":"2015-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Prevention in kindergartens with 500\u00a0ppm fluoride toothpaste\u2014a randomized clinical trial","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevention-kindergartens-500ppm-fluoride-toothpastea-randomized-clinical-trial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7811999,"mean":6.6309711159621,"rank":3625804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4011655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7811999,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268963,"mean":11.435892683724,"rank":122245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":137912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268963,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":464,"mean":2.3106652267819,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":464,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":0.958,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/guiacaries\/statuses\/735403264670367744","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8221055],"posted_on":"2016-05-25T09:32:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Guia Caries","url":"http:\/\/www.sespo.es\/guia","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/656175311076380673\/rocSfbZI_normal.jpg","description":"La Gu\u00eda de Practica Cl\u00ednica establece un protocolo para el seguimiento en funci\u00f3n de edad y riesgo de desarrollo de nuevas lesiones de caries.","id_on_source":"guiacaries","tweeter_id":"3996342196","geo":{"lt":40,"ln":-4,"country":"ES"},"followers":158},"tweet_id":"735403264670367744"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/COECdentista\/statuses\/735733256318947328","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8221055],"posted_on":"2016-05-26T07:24:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Elias Casals","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/716928018808180736\/Xnb4M4xB_normal.jpg","description":"Doctor en Odontologia.
