Ninety-nine adult subjects intending to have turbinate and\/or septal surgery were consecutively enrolled in this study. Intervention was randomized into two groups. Postoperative bleeding was collected by paper tissue and weighed to determine amount and\/or volume of blood loss. Postoperative pain was measured by using the visual analog scale. Patient preference for or against the use of a cold pack was also assessed.\nThe mean (standard deviation) postoperative bleeding in the cold pack group was 1.31 \u00b1 1.50 g compared with 1.81 \u00b1 1.89 g in the control group. The mean difference was 0.50 g (95% confidence interval, -0.19 to 1.19 g; p = 0.15). The mean (standard deviation) postoperative visual analog scale pain score in the cold pack group was 2.40 \u00b1 2.32 compared with 3.33 \u00b1 2.83 in the control group. The mean difference was 0.94 (95% confidence interval, -0.11 to 1.99; p = 0.79). Most of the subjects preferred using a cold pack (78.7%) to not using a cold pack (21.3%) (p < 0.001).\nA cold pack after turbinate and\/or septal surgery had no benefit in terms of postoperative bleeding or postoperative pain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f61000698c","authors":["Hirunwiwatkul, Prakobkiat","Charakorn, Natamon","Teerapraipruk, Bussarakum","Jongsuebsit, Theerayoot"],"doi":"10.2500\/ajra.2016.30.4306","endpage":"225","first_seen_on":"2016-05-25T15:26:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1945-8932","19458924","19458932"],"issue":"3","journal":"American Journal of Rhinology & Allergy","last_mentioned_on":1467720364,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27216354?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27216354?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/ocean\/ajra\/2016\/00000030\/00000003\/art00021?utm_content=buffer6dddc&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"27216354","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"222","subjects":["otolaryngology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"The effects of a cold pack on postoperative turbinate and\/or septal bleeding and pain","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-cold-pack-postoperative-turbinate-andor-septal-bleeding-pain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":5772238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1935131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270715,"mean":11.452218769624,"rank":172344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":82773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270715,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":549,"mean":2.5616459854015,"rank":425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":549,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.9188,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/735518450848661504","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8225202],"posted_on":"2016-05-25T17:10:38+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"735518450848661504"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/painmanwise\/statuses\/735420041055834112","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8225202],"posted_on":"2016-05-25T10:39:35+00:00","author":{"name":"painmanwise","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/514094062056390656\/ORtXawZi_normal.png","id_on_source":"painmanwise","tweeter_id":"2826634074","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":129},"tweet_id":"735420041055834112"}],"facebook":[{"title":"The effects of a cold pack on postoperative turbinate and\/or sept...: Ingenta Connect","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=980611992037995&id=247181865381015","license":"public","citation_ids":[8225202],"posted_on":"2016-07-05T12:06:04+00:00","summary":"The effects of a cold pack on postoperative turbinate and\/or septal bleeding and pain","author":{"name":"ENT Section of European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI)","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/247181865381015","facebook_wall_name":"ENT Section of European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI)","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/247181865381015\/picture","id_on_source":"247181865381015"}}]}}
