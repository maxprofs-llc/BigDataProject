In this work, in terms of ECL measurements and cyclic voltammetry, the cathodic ECL behaviors of MOF-525-Zn in aqueous media were thoroughly investigated for the first time. The photoelectric active groups ZnTCPP on the MOF-525-Zn frameworks could promote the generation of singlet oxygen ((1)O2) via a series of electrochemical and chemical reactions, resulting in a strong and stable red irradiation at 634 nm. Additionally, the surfactant tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB) further facilitated dissolved oxygen to interact with the active sites ZnTCPP of MOF-525-Zn. Furthermore, the inorganic Zr-O clusters of MOF-525-Zn were simultaneously served as the recognition sites of phosphate groups. And then, an ultrasensitive ECL sensor was proposed for protein kinase A (PKA) activity detection with a linear range from 0.01 to 20 U mL(-1) and a sensitive detection limit of 0.005 U mL(-1). This biosensor can also be applied for quantitative kinase inhibitor screening. Finally, it exhibits good performance with high stability and acceptable fabrication reproducibility, which provide a valuable strategy for clinic diagnostics and therapeutics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000823d","authors":["Zhang, Guang-Yao","Cai, Chang","Cosnier, Serge","Zeng, Hai-Bo","Zhang, Xue-Ji","Shan, Dan"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6nr01206j","first_seen_on":"2016-05-25T16:29:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2040-3372","2040-3364"],"issue":"22","journal":"Nanoscale","last_mentioned_on":1464179584,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27218308?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27218308","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Zirconium\u2013metalloporphyrin frameworks as a three-in-one platform possessing oxygen nanocage, electron media, and bonding site for electrochemiluminescence protein kinase activity assay","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zirconiummetalloporphyrin-frameworks-threeinone-platform-possessing-oxygen-nanocage-electron-media-b"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7757128,"mean":6.6329627680391,"rank":6712166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7757128,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268890,"mean":11.433008490492,"rank":224047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268890,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2084,"mean":4.5622237157945,"rank":1616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2084,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":8.9154520547945,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
