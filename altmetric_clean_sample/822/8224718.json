The structure elucidation of 1 was performed with the aid of mass spectrometry, high field NMR experiments, and crystal structure analysis. The absolute configuration of antalid was confirmed through the Mosher ester method and ultimately by total synthesis. In addition, the biosynthetic origin of this hybrid PKS-NRPS natural product was unraveled by the in silico analysis of its biosynthetic gene cluster.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Tautz, Thomas","Hoffmann, Judith","Hoffmann, Thomas","Steinmetz, Heinrich","Washausen, Peter","Kunze, Brigitte","Huch, Volker","Kitsche, Andreas","Reichenbach, Hans","H\u00f6fle, Gerhard","M\u00fcller, Rolf","Kalesse, Markus"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.orglett.6b00810","first_seen_on":"2016-05-25T15:17:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1523-7052","1523-7060"],"issue":"11","journal":"Organic Letters","last_mentioned_on":1464893666,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27220069?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27220069"],"pmid":"27220069","pubdate":"2016-05-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"\n              Isolation, Structure Elucidation, Biosynthesis, and Synthesis of Antalid, a Secondary Metabolite from\n              Polyangium species\n            ","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isolation-structure-elucidation-biosynthesis-synthesis-antalid-secondary-metabolite-polyangium-speci"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":3647540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4023972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269203,"mean":11.438818478317,"rank":122322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":138091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269203,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3757,"mean":3.3668706070288,"rank":1793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1860,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3757,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122,"mean":6.2050578512397,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
