Although the meso form is much more difficult to transport and store because of its higher freezing point than those of the optically active forms, most microorganisms capable of producing 2,3-BD mainly yield meso-2,3-BD. Thus, we developed a metabolically engineered (R,R)-2,3-BD overproducing strain using a Klebsiella oxytoca \u0394ldhA \u0394pflB strain, which shows an outstanding 2,3-BD production performance with more than 90\u00a0% of the meso form. A budC gene encoding 2,3-BD dehydrogenase in the K. oxytoca \u0394ldhA \u0394pflB strain was replaced with an exogenous gene encoding (R,R)-2,3-BD dehydrogenase from Paenibacillus polymyxa (K. oxytoca \u0394ldhA \u0394pflB \u0394budC::PBDH strain), and then its expression level was further amplified with using a pBBR1MCS plasmid. The fed-batch fermentation of the K. oxytoca \u0394ldhA \u0394pflB \u0394budC::PBDH (pBBR-PBDH) strain with intermittent glucose feeding allowed the production of 106.7\u00a0g\/L of (R,R)-2,3-BD [meso-2,3-BD, 9.3\u00a0g\/L], with a yield of 0.40\u00a0g\/g and a productivity of 3.1\u00a0g\/L\/h, which should be useful for the industrial application of 2,3-BD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df4","authors":["Park, Jong Myoung","Rathnasingh, Chelladurai","Song, Hyohak"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10295-015-1648-z","first_seen_on":"2015-08-16T10:13:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-5535"],"journal":"Journal of Industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1439719983,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26275527?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26275527","pubdate":"2015-08-16T22:00:41+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetic Engineering","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology"],"title":"Enhanced production of (R,R)-2,3-butanediol by metabolically engineered Klebsiella oxytoca.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enhanced-production-rr23butanediol-metabolically-engineered-klebsiella-oxytoca"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5487712,"mean":6.3730424488449,"rank":4565345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5487712,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178889,"mean":9.3058795559233,"rank":143462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178889,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":317,"mean":1.8110063291139,"rank":192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":317,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.1825,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
