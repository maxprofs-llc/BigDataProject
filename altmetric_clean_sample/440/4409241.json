Penile secondary lesions are rare entities. Primary locations are usually the pelvic cavity organs, namely the prostate and the bladder as the most common ones. Priapism as a first manifestation of these kinds of lesions is even rarer. The aim was to present a 52-year-old patient harboring a penile metastasis that originated in the primary prostate adenocarcinoma, manifesting itself as a \"common\" priapism. The patient referred to the emergency room presenting with a priapism and nodules at the coronal sulcus, without previous similar episodes. His evolution until properly diagnosed was catastrophic with multiple lymph nodes, bone and organ involvement, and with his demise soon after from serious bleeding and congestive heart failure, almost 2 months after he first came to the emergency room. We review the literature concerning malignant priapism, diagnosis, and current treatment and survival perspectives.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53b3cf058f6100046e0","authors":["Sandro Roberto da Silva Gaspar","Alvaro Nunes","Jose Santos Dias","Tome Lopes"],"doi":"10.4103\/0974-7796.152030","first_seen_on":"2015-08-18T17:32:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0974-7796"],"issue":"3","journal":"Urology Annals","last_mentioned_on":1439919434,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4518384\/?report=classic"],"pmid":"26229335","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"391","title":"Malignant priapism: Penile metastasis originating on a primary prostate adenocarcinoma","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/malignant-priapism-penile-metastasis-originating-primary-prostate-adenocarcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5558092,"mean":6.324208653655,"rank":3929316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":923887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5558092,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192113,"mean":9.1781272486884,"rank":132494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192113,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":2.4549450549451,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.53125,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
