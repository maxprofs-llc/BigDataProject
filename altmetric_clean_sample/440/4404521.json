The present study aimed to analyze the effects of a computer-based program for training the spatial-simultaneous component of WM in terms of: specific effects (on spatial-simultaneous WM tasks); near and far transfer effects (on spatial-sequential and visuospatial abilities, and everyday memory tasks); and maintenance effects (1 month after the training). A comparison was drawn between the results obtained when the training was led by parents at home as opposed to an expert in psychology. Thirty-nine children and adolescents with DS were allocated to one of two groups: the training was administered by an expert in one, and by appropriately instructed parents in the other. The training was administered individually twice a week for a month, in eight sessions lasting approximately 30 min each. Our participants' performance improved after the training, and these results were maintained a month later in both groups. Overall, our findings suggest that spatial-simultaneous WM performance can be improved, obtaining specific and transfer gains; above all, it seems that, with adequate support, parents could effectively administer a WM training to their child.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc1b","authors":["Pulina, Francesca","Carretti, Barbara","Lanfranchi, Silvia","Mammarella, Irene Cristina"],"doi":"10.3389\/fpsyg.2015.01265","first_seen_on":"2015-08-17T14:12:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-1078"],"journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1442607016,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2015.01265\/abstract"],"pmid":"26379590","pubdate":"2015-08-17T20:15:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Improving spatial-simultaneous working memory in Down syndrome: effect of a training program led by parents instead of an expert","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improving-spatialsimultaneous-working-memory-down-syndrome-effect-training-program-led-parents-inste"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6364970,"mean":5.8384411964931,"rank":2167150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4151958,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6364970,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194678,"mean":9.1641768878707,"rank":67568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":125196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194678,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5768,"mean":10.13161366395,"rank":2613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5768,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":555,"mean":10.11223465704,"rank":239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":308,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":555,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
