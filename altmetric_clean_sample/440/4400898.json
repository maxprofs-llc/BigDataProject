Ethyl cellulose (EC) was used as the filament-forming matrix in the outer, middle, and inner working solutions, and was combined with varied contents of the model active ingredient ketoprofen (KET) in the three fluids. Triaxial electrospinning was successfully carried out to generate medicated nanofibers. The resultant nanofibers had diameters of 0.74 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b5m, linear morphologies, smooth surfaces, and clear tri-layer nanostructures. The KET concentration in each layer gradually increased from the outer to the inner layer. In vitro dissolution tests demonstrated that the nanofibers could provide linear release of KET over 20 h. The protocol reported in this study provides a facile approach to implement a straightforward one-step triaxial electrospinning process for creating functional nanofibers with sophisticated structural features.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Deng-Guang Yu","Yu, DG"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsami.5b06007","endpage":"18897","first_seen_on":"2015-08-15T17:42:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1944-8252","1944-8244"],"issue":"33","journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1470648603,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsami.5b06007","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26244640","http:\/\/discovery.ucl.ac.uk\/1470364\/"],"pmid":"26244640","pubdate":"2015-08-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
