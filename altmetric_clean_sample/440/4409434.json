This meta-analysis aims to examine the relationship between CRC risk perception and screening behavior, while considering potential moderators and study quality. A search of six databases yielded 58 studies (63 effect sizes) that quantitatively assessed the relationship between CRC risk perception and screening behavior. Most included effect sizes (75\u00a0%) reported a positive association between CRC risk perception and screening behavior. A random effects meta-analysis yielded an overall effect size of z\u00a0=\u00a00.13 (95\u00a0% CI 0.10-0.16), which was heterogeneous (I (2)\u00a0=\u00a099\u00a0%, \u03c4(2)\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Effect sizes from high-quality studies were significantly lower than those from lower quality studies (z\u00a0=\u00a00.02 vs. 0.16). We found a small, positive relationship between CRC risk perception and reported screening behavior, with important identified heterogeneity across moderators. Future studies should focus on high quality study design.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc0","authors":["Thomas M. Atkinson","Talya Salz","Kaitlin K. Touza","Yuelin Li","Jennifer L.
