One randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study (1222.6; 296 patients) administered treatment in the morning. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were performed pre-dose (trough) and \u22643\u00a0hours post-dose (weeks 1 and 2), and \u22646\u00a0hours post-dose after 4\u00a0weeks; primary end point was trough forced expiratory volume in 1\u00a0second (FEV1) response (change from baseline mean FEV1) after 4\u00a0weeks. A second randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (formoterol 12\u00a0\u03bcg twice-daily) incomplete-block crossover study (1222.27; 198 patients) administered QD treatments in the evening. PFTs were performed over a 24-hour dosing interval after 4\u00a0weeks; primary end point was FEV1 area under the curve from 0-24 hours (AUC0-24) response (change from study baseline [mean FEV1] after 4\u00a0weeks).\nStudy 1222.6 showed a statistically significant increase in trough FEV1 response with olodaterol 20\u00a0\u03bcg (0.147\u00a0L; 95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI]: 0.059, 0.234; p\u2009=\u20090.001) versus placebo, with more limited efficacy and no evidence of dose response compared to placebo across the other olodaterol doses (2, 5 and 10\u00a0\u03bcg). Study 1222.27 demonstrated increases in FEV1 AUC0-24 responses at 4\u00a0weeks with all active treatments (p\u2009<\u20090.0001); adjusted mean (95\u00a0% CI) differences from placebo were 0.140 (0.097, 0.182), 0.182 (0.140, 0.224), 0.205 (0.163, 0.248) and 0.229 (0.186, 0.272) L for olodaterol 2, 5, 10 and 20\u00a0\u03bcg, respectively, and 0.169 (0.126, 0.211) for formoterol, providing evidence of increased efficacy with higher olodaterol dose. Olodaterol was generally well tolerated, with a few events associated with known sympathomimetic effects, mainly with 20\u00a0\u03bcg.\nThe LABA olodaterol has >24-hour duration of action. In patients with asthma, evidence of bronchodilator efficacy was demonstrated with statistically and clinically significant improvements in the primary end point of trough FEV1 response measured in clinics over placebo for the highest administered dose of 20\u00a0\u03bcg in Study 1222.6, and statistically and clinically significant improvements versus placebo in FEV1 AUC0-24 responses at 4\u00a0weeks for all doses tested in Study 1222.27, which also exhibited a dose response. Bronchodilator efficacy was seen over placebo for all olodaterol doses for morning and evening peak expiratory flow in both studies. All doses were well tolerated.\nNCT00467740 (1222.6) and NCT01013753 (1222.27).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000892","authors":["Paul M O\u2019Byrne","Tony D\u2019Urzo","Ekkehard Beck","Matja\u017e Fle\u017ear","Martina Gahlemann","Lorna Hart","Zuzana Blahova","Robert Toorawa","Kai-Michael Beeh","O'Byrne, Paul M","D'Urzo, Tony","Beck, Ekkehard","Fle\u017ear, Matja\u017e","Gahlemann, Martina","Hart, Lorna","Blahova, Zuzana","Toorawa, Robert","Beeh, Kai-Michael","Paul M.
