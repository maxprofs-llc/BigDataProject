We need clinical databases."],"citation":{"abstract":"Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy might lead to clinical and histologic remission in a significant proportion of patients with symptomatic esophageal eosinophilia (>15 eos\/HPF). We aimed to systematically evaluate the efficacy of PPI therapy for these patients.\nA search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS databases, and the AGA, ACG and UEG meetings abstract books, was performed. Primary outcomes were clinical response and histological remission (<15 eos\/HPF) after PPI therapy. Secondary outcomes were the influence on the response to PPIs of age group, study design\/quality, PPI type, doses and interval dosing and pH monitoring results. Data were pooled under a random-effects model.\nThirty three studies (eleven prospective studies) comprising 619 patients with symptomatic esophageal eosinophilia (188 children and 431 adults) were finally included. PPI therapy led to clinical response in 60.8% (95%CI, 48.38% - 72.2%; I(2)=80.2) and histological remission in 50.5% (95%CI, 42.2%-58.7%; I(2)=67.5) of patients. No differences were observed regarding the study population (children vs. adults), the type of publication or its quality. PPIs were non-significantly more effective in prospective studies (52.6% vs. 39.1%), administered twice daily compared to once daily (55.9% vs. 49.7%), and with a pathological pH monitoring (65.4% vs. 49.3%). A significant publication bias in favor of studies reporting histological responses to PPIs was observed.\nPPI therapy induces clinico-histological remission in half of patients with symptomatic esophageal eosinophilia. This finding should be interpreted with caution due to poor-quality evidence, heterogeneity and publication bias.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006eff","authors":["Lucendo, Alfredo J","Arias, \u00c1ngel","Molina-Infante, Javier","Alfredo J.
