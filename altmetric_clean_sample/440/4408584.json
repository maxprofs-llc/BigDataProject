Of the 41 adults with CP included in the study, 10 were not matchable due to low body masses.\nNot applicable MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Computed tomography scans were assessed for visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT and SAT areas), psoas major area and attenuation in Hounsfield units (HU), and cortical and trabecular BMDs.\nAdults with CP had lower cortical (\u03b2=-63.41 HU, p<0.001) and trabecular (\u03b2=-42.24 HU, p<0.001) BMDs, as well as psoas major areas (\u03b2=-374.51 mm(2), p<0.001) and attenuation (\u03b2=-9.21 HU, p<0.001), after controlling for age, sex, and body mass. Adults with CP had greater VAT (\u03b2=3914.81 mm(2), p<0.001) and SAT (\u03b2=4615.68 mm(2), p<0.001). Muscle attenuation was significantly correlated with trabecular (r=0.51, p=0.002) and cortical (r=0.46, p<0.01) BMD; whereas VAT was negatively associated with cortical BMD (\u03b2=-0.037 HU\/cm(2); r(2)=0.13; p=0.03).\nAdults with CP had lower BMDs, smaller psoas major area, greater intermuscular adipose tissue, and greater trunk adiposity than neuro-typical adults. VAT and cortical BMD were inversely associated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005737","authors":["Peterson, Mark D","Zhang, Peng","Haapala, Heidi J","Wang, Stewart C","Hurvitz, Edward A","Mark D.
