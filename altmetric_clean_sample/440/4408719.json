We demonstrate that in bulk water, defects consisting of 5- and higher coordinated water are a major contributor to dynamics. Close to a hydrophobe, 3-coordinated defects take over. The co-existence of these defects gives rise to very different local densities. We propose that the slowing down of rotational motion close to a hydrophobe is induced by an interplay between density and order with the slowing down decreasing in the following order: (i) low-density ordered-water, (ii) normal-density ordered-water, (iii) high-density ordered-water and (iv) disordered-water. The proportions of these water environments vary with temperature. These local environments also support the idea of water's polymorphism, i.e., the existence of the high- and low-density states in supercooled water.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f61000898b","authors":["John Tatini Titantah","Mikko Karttunen"],"doi":"10.1039\/c5sm00930h","endpage":"7985","first_seen_on":"2015-08-18T15:26:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-6848"],"issue":"40","journal":"Soft Matter","last_mentioned_on":1439932852,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/SM\/C5SM00930H","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/SM\/C5SM00930H#!divAbstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2015\/sm\/c5sm00930h","pmid":"26327528","pubdate":"2015-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"7977","title":"Hydrophobicity: Effect of density & order on water\u2019s rotational slowing down","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hydrophobicity-effect-density-order-waters-rotational-slowing-down"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5558092,"mean":6.324208653655,"rank":3699786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1628914,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5558092,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192112,"mean":9.178166695296,"rank":123258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":59620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192112,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1775,"mean":2.1607891770011,"rank":896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":799,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1775,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":3.3661489361702,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
