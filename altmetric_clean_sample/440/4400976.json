However, the toxicity of DMAE-CB may hamper its wide application in clinical situations. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the toxicity of DMAE-CB and explore the possible protective effects of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis showed that chemical binding of NAC and DMAE-CB occurred in a time dependent manner. Pre-incubation of fourty-eight hours is required for adequate reaction between DMAE-CB and NAC. DMAE-CB reduced human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) viability in a dose-dependent manner. The toxic effects of DMAE-CB were accompanied by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and reduced glutathione (GSH) content. NAC alleviated DMAE-CB-induced oxidative stress. Annexin V\/ Propidium Iodide (PI) staining and Hoechst 33342 staining indicated that DMAE-CB induced apoptosis. Collapsed mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and activation of caspase-3 were also observed after DMAE-CB treatment. NAC rescued hDPCs from DMAE-CB-induced apoptosis, accompanied by lower level of MMP loss and caspase-3 activity. This study assists to elucidate the mechanism underlying the cytotoxic effects of DMAE-CB and provides theoretical supports for the searching of effective strategies to reduce toxicity of quaternary ammonium dental monomers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yang Jiao","Sai Ma","Jing Li","Lequn Shan","Yingjie Wang","Min Tian","Yanwei Yang","Jinlong Sun","Jinghao Ban","Jihua Chen"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0135815","first_seen_on":"2015-08-15T18:30:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1439663420,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0135815"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0135815.PDF","pmid":"26274909","pubdate":"2015-08-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC)-Directed Detoxification of Methacryloxylethyl Cetyl Ammonium Chloride (DMAE-CB)","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nacetyl-cysteine-nacdirected-detoxification-methacryloxylethyl-cetyl-ammonium-chloride-dmaecb"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5484049,"mean":6.3683118320617,"rank":4562199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5484049,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191808,"mean":9.0493212656473,"rank":153764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191808,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95295,"mean":9.6391526853738,"rank":79866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95295,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6107,"mean":8.7443321323289,"rank":5145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6107,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Sports and Recreations":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BioResearch\/statuses\/632620351764062208","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4400976],"posted_on":"2015-08-15T18:30:20+00:00","author":{"name":"BioInformatics","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_0_normal.png","id_on_source":"BioResearch","tweeter_id":"3007985099","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5},"tweet_id":"632620351764062208"}]}}
