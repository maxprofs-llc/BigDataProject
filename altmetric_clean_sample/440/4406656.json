Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) was shown to increase Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP). We therefore hypothesized that treatment with CRT would provide incremental benefit in patients with lower SBP values.\n-The independent contribution of SBP to outcome was analyzed in 1,267 patients with LBBB enrolled in MADIT-CRT (Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy). SBP was assessed as continuous measures and further categorized into approximate quintiles. The risk of long-term HF or death, and CRT-D vs. ICD benefit was assessed in multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models. Multivariate analysis showed that in the ICD arm, each 10 mmHg decrement of SBP was independently associated with a significant 21% (p<0.001) increased risk for HF or death, and patients with lower quintile SBP (<110 mm Hg) experienced a corresponding >2-fold risk-increase. CRT-D therapy provided the greatest HF or mortality risk reduction in patients with SBP<110 mmHg HR=0.34, p<0.001, compared to HR=0.52, p<0.001 in those with 110>SBP\u2265136 mmHg and HR=0.94, p=0.808 with SBP>136 mmHg (p for trend=0.001).\n-In patients with mild HF, prolonged QRS, and LBBB, low SBP is related to higher risk of mortality or HF with ICD therapy alone. Treatment with CRT is associated with incremental clinical benefits in patients with lower baseline systolic blood pressure values. Clinical Trial Registration-URL: http:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov.
