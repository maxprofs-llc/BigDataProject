As micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA)-200 and ETAR may play an essential role in the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) simultaneously, the purpose of this study was to detect the expression of miRNA-200c and ETAR messenger (m)RNA and assess their prognostic significance in early stage NSCLC.\nOur study included 78 advanced stage (IIB, IIIA, IIIB) NSCLC patients. All patients were smokers. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis, we detected the expression of miRNA-200c and ETAR mRNA and assessed their correlation by \u03c7(2) test. Time to progression was used as the recurrent index and was assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis in the Cox hazard model.\nBoth miRNA-200c and ETAR mRNA expression are associated with N stage and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage in a series of advanced NSCLC patients. Among N stage and TNM stage patients, significant differences were found in IIB (P\u2009=\u20090.0126), IIIB (P\u2009=\u20090.0107) and N0 (P\u2009=\u20090.0023) and in N1\u2009+\u2009N2 groups (P\u2009=\u20090.0133). Using both univariate and multivariate survival analyses, we found that miRNA-200c (hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20090.352, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.187-0.662) and ETAR mRNA (HR\u2009=\u20092.500 95% CI: 1.345-4.647) were independent prognostic factors, independent of TNM stage (HR\u2009=\u20092.414, 95% CI: 1.600-3.642) and differentiation (HR\u2009=\u20091.530, 95% CI: 1.050-2230).\nmiRNA-200c induces an expedient surgical survival, whereas ETAR mRNA has the reverse prognosis in advanced stage NSCLC patients. A potential relationship exists in that miRNA-200c targets ETAR mRNA during EMT.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b6d","authors":["Zhao, Jinpeng","Zhao, Yandong","Wang, Zizong","Xuan, Yunpeng","Luo, Yiren","Jiao, Wenjie"],"doi":"10.1111\/1759-7714.12193","first_seen_on":"2015-08-15T18:17:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1759-7706"],"issue":"4","journal":"Thoracic Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1439683747,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26273396?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26273396","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Loss expression of micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA)-200c induces adverse post-surgical prognosis of advanced stage non-small cell lung carcinoma and its potential relationship with ETAR messenger RNA.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/loss-expression-micro-ribonucleic-acid-mirna200c-induces-adverse-postsurgical-prognosis-advanced-sta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5484049,"mean":6.3683118320617,"rank":3859334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":921887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5484049,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191808,"mean":9.0492819031632,"rank":132465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38048,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191808,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103,"mean":1.244862745098,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.354347826087,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/632617010204028928","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4400954],"posted_on":"2015-08-15T18:17:03+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
