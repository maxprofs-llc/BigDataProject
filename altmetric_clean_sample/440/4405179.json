Mere percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) should not be the only goal of treatment.\nOne hundred seventy-three obese patients were included in the study. They underwent either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB; n\u2009=\u2009127, mean body mass index (BMI) 45.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.7\u00a0kg\/m(2)) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG; n\u2009=\u200946, mean BMI 55.9\u2009\u00b1\u20097.8\u00a0kg\/m(2)) for weight reduction. Body weight and body composition were assessed periodically by bioelectrical impedance analysis.\nAfter 1\u00a0year of observation, %EWL was 62.9\u2009\u00b1\u200918.0\u00a0% in RYGB and 52.3\u2009\u00b1\u200915.0\u00a0% in SG (p\u2009=\u20090.0024). Body fat was reduced in both procedures with a slight preference for SG, and lean body mass was better preserved in the RYGB group. Due to significant differences in the initial BMI between the two groups, an analysis of covariance was performed, which demonstrated no significant differences in the %EWL as well as in the other parameters of body composition 1\u00a0year after surgery. Using percentage of total weight loss to evaluate the outcomes between the two procedures, no significant difference was found (31.7\u2009\u00b1\u20098.4\u00a0% in RYGB and 30.5\u2009\u00b1\u20097.6\u00a0% in SG patients, p\u2009>\u20090.4).\nExcess weight loss is highly influenced by the initial BMI. Total weight loss seems to be a better measurement tool abolishing initial weight differences. SG and RYGB do not differ in terms of body composition and weight loss 1\u00a0year after surgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f610008357","authors":["Mirko Otto","Mohamad Elrefai","Johannes Krammer","Christel Wei\u00df","Peter Kienle","Till Hasenberg"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11695-015-1792-6","first_seen_on":"2015-08-17T17:56:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1708-0428"],"journal":"Obesity Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1439834180,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11695-015-1792-6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11695-015-1792-6.pdf","pmid":"26189734","pubdate":"2015-07-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["metabolism","generalsurgery"],"title":"Sleeve Gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Lead to Comparable Changes in Body Composition after Adjustment for Initial Body Mass Index","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sleeve-gastrectomy-rouxeny-gastric-bypass-lead-comparable-changes-body-composition-after-adjustment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5493125,"mean":6.3767617508741,"rank":3866070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":922780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5493125,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192274,"mean":9.1558759576228,"rank":132661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192274,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1547,"mean":2.7562069857697,"rank":928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1547,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":3.0572727272727,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
