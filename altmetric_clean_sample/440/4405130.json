In the present work, we justified the two-dimensional representation of a neuronal input by voltage-independent current and conductance and obtained experimentally and numerically a complete input-output (I\/O) function. The dependence of the steady-state firing rate on the input current and conductance was studied as a two-parameter I\/O function. We employed the dynamic patch clamp technique in slices to get this dependence for the whole domain of two input signals that evoke stationary spike trains in a single neuron (\u03a9-domain). As found, the \u03a9-domain is finite and an additional conductance decreases the range of spike-evoking currents. The I\/O function has been reproduced in a Hodgkin-Huxley-like model. Among the simulated effects of different factors on the I\/O function, including passive and active membrane properties, external conditions and input signal properties, the most interesting were: the shift of the right boundary of the \u03a9-domain (corresponding to the exCitation block) leftwards due to the decrease of the maximal potassium conductance; and the reduction of the \u03a9-domain by the decrease of the maximal sodium concentration. As found in experiments and simulations, the \u03a9-domain is reduced by the decrease of extracellular sodium concentration, by cooling, and by adding slow potassium currents providing interspike interval adaptation; the \u03a9-domain height is increased by adding color noise. Our modeling data provided a generalization of I\/O dependencies that is consistent with previous studies and our experiments. Our results suggest that both current flow and membrane conductance should be taken into account when determining neuronal firing activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c0b","authors":["E.
