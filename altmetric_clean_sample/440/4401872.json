Neutrophil\/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet\/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) have been studied as inflammatory biomarkers in atherosclerosis, but data regarding AMI are lacking. The study population included patients with AMI (n\u200a=\u200a46) versus age and sex-matched healthy controls (n\u200a=\u200a46). Computed multidetector tomographic angiography was performed to diagnose AMI. NLR and PLR were calculated using complete blood count. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also analyzed. Neutrophil levels and lymphocytes were significantly higher in patients with AMI than in the control individuals (P\u200a<\u200a0.001 and P\u200a=\u200a0.43, respectively). NLR levels were significantly higher in patients with AMI compared with that in the control individuals (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Platelet levels did not reach statistical significance between the groups (P\u200a=\u200a0.709). However, patients with AMI had significantly higher PLR levels than the control group (P\u200a=\u200a0.039). CRP levels on admission were higher in patients with AMI in comparison with control individuals. There was also a positive correlation between NLR and CRP (r\u200a=\u200a0.548, P\u200a<\u200a0.001), and between PLR and CRP (r\u200a=\u200a0.528, P\u200a<\u200a0.001). NLR level greater than 4.5, measured on admission, yielded an area under the curve value of 0.790 (95% confidence interval 0.681-0.799, sensitivity 77%, specificity 72%), and PLR level of greater than 157 yielded an area under the curve value of 0.604 (95% confidence interval 0.486-0.722, sensitivity 59%, specificity 65%). Patients with AMI had increased NLR, PLR, and CRP levels compared with controls. Increased NLR and PLR was an independent predictor of AMI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dd4","authors":["Toptas, Mehmet","Akkoc, \u0130brahim","Savas, Yldray","Uzman, Sinan","Toptas, Yasar","Can, Mehmet Mustafa"],"doi":"10.1097\/mbc.0000000000000372","first_seen_on":"2015-08-16T07:00:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-5733","0957-5235"],"journal":"Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis","last_mentioned_on":1439708398,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/bloodcoagulation\/9000\/00000\/Novel_hematologic_inflammatory_parameters_to.98986.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/bloodcoagulation\/9000\/00000\/Novel_hematologic_inflammatory_parameters_to.98986.pdf","pmid":"26258672","pubdate":"2015-08-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Novel hematologic inflammatory parameters to predict acute mesenteric ischemia.","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-hematologic-inflammatory-parameters-predict-acute-mesenteric-ischemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5487749,"mean":6.3734385704297,"rank":3862171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":922206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5487749,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178889,"mean":9.3061285944279,"rank":123792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":35425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178889,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":735,"mean":0.96739782016349,"rank":212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":735,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":0.68450704225352,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BloodCoagFibrin\/statuses\/632809004448649216","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4401872],"posted_on":"2015-08-16T06:59:58+00:00","author":{"name":"Blood Coag & Fibrin","url":"http:\/\/www.bloodcoagulation.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2436101481\/gxkzmqfq7cf9ekh29zp4_normal.jpeg","description":"Devoted to publishing significant developments worldwide in the field of blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, thrombosis, platelets and the kininogen-kinin system.","id_on_source":"BloodCoagFibrin","tweeter_id":"718776926","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":175},"tweet_id":"632809004448649216"}]}}
