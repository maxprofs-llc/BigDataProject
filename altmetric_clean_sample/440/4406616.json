It is particularly suitable for studying decision situations that are difficult to assess empirically. This article evaluates whether the FS method is suitable for studying decisions in gerontological research.\nThe present article draws on data from the Housing Opportunities & Mobility in the Elderly study. A total of 103 respondents (between 55 and 90 years) were asked to make hypothetical relocation decisions. The consistency of these responses was assessed as a function of respondents' age, gender, immigration background, education, household income, employment status, and intention to move.\nNo significant differences in response consistency were attributable to age, gender, education, or immigration background. The personal relevance of the survey topic was positively related to response consistency in multiperson households.\nFS method can, under certain methodological conditions, be used among older adults especially when the topic of the survey is relevant to their daily lives.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f61000346c","authors":["Andrea Teti","Christiane Gross","Nina Knoll","Stefan Bl\u00fcher"],"doi":"10.1177\/0164027515600767","first_seen_on":"2015-08-18T03:15:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1552-7573"],"journal":"Research on Aging","last_mentioned_on":1439867722,"links":["http:\/\/roa.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/14\/0164027515600767.abstract?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/roa.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/14\/0164027515600767.full.pdf","pmid":"26282570","pubdate":"2015-08-19T22:01:18+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Feasibility of the Factorial Survey Method in Aging Research Consistency Effects Among Older Respondents","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/feasibility-factorial-survey-method-aging-research-consistency-effects-among-older-respondents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5557106,"mean":6.3232113487157,"rank":2923265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1868666,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5557106,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192100,"mean":9.1779933888256,"rank":104157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":69006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192100,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192,"mean":4.0522094240838,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.7,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AgeMeNot\/statuses\/633477257504264193","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4406616],"posted_on":"2015-08-18T03:15:22+00:00","author":{"name":"AgeMeNot","url":"http:\/\/www.agemenot.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000672443956\/f44ad8598a7907ec2d95385bd981b691_normal.jpeg","description":"An Anti Aging Resource You Can Trust.
