This transplantation milieu has resulted in favorable outcomes with low transplantation-related mortality due to a low incidence of GVHD, without increased infectious complications; however, the high relapse rate remains a major concern. We therefore performed a prospective pilot study of HLA haplo-identical peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) with intensified conditioning followed by two lower doses of PT\/Cy. A total of 20 patients with refractory or poor prognosis myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and leukemia were enrolled in the study. A trend towards a lower incidence of grade III-IV acute GVHD at day 100 in the \"25 mg\/kg x 2 doses of PT\/Cy\" group compared with the \"25 mg\/kg of PT\/Cy\" group (9.1% vs. 33%, P=0.20) was noted. However, the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was however low at 10% irrespective of PT\/Cy dose. The number of infused CD34+cells significantly correlated with the grade of acute GVHD (P=0.004). In addition, the occurrence of BK virus infection was significantly more common in the double-dose PT\/Cy group (25% vs. 0%, P=0.043), especially when combined with busulfan. The probability of overall survival at one year in the double dose group tended to be better compared to that in the single dose group (64% vs.44%, respectively; P=0.20). In conclusion, HLA haplo-identical T-cell replete PBSCT with 25 mg\/kg x 2 doses of PT\/Cy might be a feasible option for high-risk leukemia and MDS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002895","authors":["Nakamae, Hirohisa","Koh, Hideo","Katayama, Takako","Nishimoto, Mitsutaka","Hayashi, Yoshiki","Nakashima, Yasuhiro","Nakane, Takahiko","Nakamae, Mika","Hirose, Asao","Hino, Masayuki"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.exphem.2015.07.006","first_seen_on":"2015-08-16T21:28:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0301472X","1873-2399"],"journal":"Experimental Hematology","last_mentioned_on":1448388009,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0301472X15005688&_version=1&md5=268ceb03db3b42fdffb15ac3780e6381","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0301472X15005688?sf15760228%3D1%26cc%3Dy"],"pmid":"26284307","pubdate":"2015-08-19T22:00:33+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"HLA haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell transplantation using reduced dose of posttransplantation cyclophosphamide for poor-prognosis or refractory leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hla-haploidentical-peripheral-blood-stem-cell-transplantation-using-reduced-dose-posttransplantation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6602221,"mean":6.1274999121509,"rank":2733964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3718152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6602221,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184151,"mean":9.4453363562315,"rank":83810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":93947,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184151,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":390,"mean":2.7743444730077,"rank":157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":390,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.3136363636364,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Chemistry":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HemoglobinNews\/statuses\/633027617512275968","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4402997],"posted_on":"2015-08-16T21:28:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Hemoglobin News","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_1_normal.png","id_on_source":"HemoglobinNews","tweeter_id":"3010759746","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":0},"tweet_id":"633027617512275968"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ELShematology\/statuses\/669213930435268608","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4402997],"posted_on":"2015-11-24T18:00:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Elsevier Hematology","url":"http:\/\/www.hematologyadvance.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/615567362125889536\/9abt9Dl8_normal.jpg","description":"Tweets about our Hematology books and  journals, related research news for scientists, students, practitioners, industry and everyone else who is interested","id_on_source":"ELShematology","tweeter_id":"1934440580","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3344},"tweet_id":"669213930435268608"}]}}
