Changes of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures suggesting WM disruption have been reported in patients with schizophrenia together with a history of childhood maltreatment. We therefore hypothesized that ACE could be associated with altered DTI measures of WM integrity in patients with schizophrenia. We tested this hypothesis in 83 schizophrenia patients using whole brain tract-based spatial statistics in the WM skeleton with threshold-free cluster enhancement of DTI measures of WM microstructure: axial, radial, and mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA). We observed an inverse correlation between severity of ACE and DTI measures of FA, and a positive correlation with MD in several WM tracts including corona radiata, thalamic radiations, corpus callosum, cingulum bundle, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus. Lower FA and higher MD are indexes of a reduction in fibre coherence and integrity. The association of ACE to reduced FA and increased MD in key WM tracts contributing to the functional integrity of the brain suggests that ACE might contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia through a detrimental action on structural connectivity in critical cortico-limbic networks.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d2","authors":["Sara Poletti","Elena Mazza","Irene Bollettini","Clara Locatelli","Roberto Cavallaro","Enrico Smeraldi","Francesco Benedetti"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pscychresns.2015.08.003","first_seen_on":"2015-08-16T03:28:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09254927","1872-7123"],"journal":"Psychiatry Research","last_mentioned_on":1467122061,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S092549271530055X&_version=1&md5=0696bc46f8ce1d50b99ad4d412387f29","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26341951?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26341951?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26341951","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"PSYND1500002","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Adverse childhood experiences influence white matter microstructure in patients with schizophrenia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adverse-childhood-experiences-influence-white-matter-microstructure-patients-schizophrenia-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7958342,"mean":6.7226589717569,"rank":3351543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4572001,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7958342,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213823,"mean":8.7956746452657,"rank":78596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":133715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213823,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3708,"mean":4.5975732398166,"rank":1395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":2273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3708,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207,"mean":5.4981165048544,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
