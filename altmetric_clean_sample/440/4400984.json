Achyranthes aspera Linn. (AA) is used in folklore for the treatment of various inflammatory ailments and arthritis like conditions. Anti-inflammatory activity of saponin rich (SR) fraction of AA has been previously reported. The objective of this study was to assess the antiarthritic effect of SR fraction of Achyranthes aspera in adjuvant-induced arthritic rats. Methods. Arthritis was assessed by arthritis score, paw volume, changes in tibiotarsal joint thickness, hyperalgesic parameters, and spleen and thymus index. Haematological, serum, biochemical, and inflammatory cytokine and in vivo antioxidant parameters were measured on the last day of the study. Results. SR fraction significantly suppressed paw swelling and arthritic score and improved the pain threshold in motility and stair climbing tests. There was a reversal in the levels of altered parameters, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and antioxidant parameters like superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, malondialdehyde, and nitric oxide. SR fraction significantly decreased plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. Moreover, histopathology revealed a significant reduction in synovial hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration, and bone destruction in the joints. Conclusion. These observations explain the therapeutic benefit of SR fraction of AA in suppressing the progression of adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51e3cf058f610003990","authors":["Kothavade, Pankaj S","Bulani, Vipin D","Nagmoti, Dnyaneshwar M","Deshpande, Padmini S","Gawali, Nitin B","Juvekar, Archana R"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/943645","first_seen_on":"2015-08-15T18:33:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2090-0422"],"journal":"Autoimmune Diseases (2090-0422)","last_mentioned_on":1439671565,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26273477?doptAbstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26273477?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26273477","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Therapeutic Effect of Saponin Rich Fraction of Achyranthes aspera Linn. on Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis in Sprague-Dawley Rats.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/therapeutic-effect-saponin-rich-fraction-iachyranthes-asperai-linn-adjuvantinduced-arthritis-sprague"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5483947,"mean":6.3681683802118,"rank":3859265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":921891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5483947,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191810,"mean":9.0495193343378,"rank":132468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38044,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191810,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":3.8602376237624,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":11.433333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ConcordeMedica\/statuses\/632621010592886784","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4400984],"posted_on":"2015-08-15T18:32:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Alex Concorde","url":"http:\/\/www.dralexconcorde.info\/#!health-and-medicine\/c224f","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1248165228\/concorde_medica_cropped__normal.jpg","description":"Dr Alex is creator of a unique 21C Individual Medicine called 'CruX'!
