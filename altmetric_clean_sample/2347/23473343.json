Here, we report on a step towards this vision through the design, fabrication, and operation of a host-guest light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) featuring an organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) guest that harvests both singlet and triplet excitons for the emission. The rare-metal-free active material also comprises a polymeric electrolyte and a polymeric compatibilizer for the facilitation of a cost-efficient and scalable solution-based fabrication, and for the use of air-stabile electrodes. We report that such TADF-LEC devices can deliver uniform green light emission with a maximum luminance of 228 cd m(-2) when driven by a constant-current density of 770 A m(-2), and 760 cd m(-2) during a voltage ramp, which represents a one-order-of-magnitude improvement in comparison to previous TADF-emitting LECs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Petter Lundberg","E.
