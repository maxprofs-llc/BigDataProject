In this paper, four isolates from agricultural and urban contaminated soil showed abundant growth in the presence of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4\u00b75H2O) up to 2\u00a0mM. Selected yeasts were identified by molecular methods as Candida tropicalis (three isolates) and Schwanniomyces occidentalis (one isolate). C. tropicalis (4TD1101S) showed the highest percentage of bioaccumulation capabilities (94.37%), determined by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The Raman spectra of C. tropicalis (4TD1101S) analyzed in a medium with the addition of 2\u00a0mM CuSO4\u00b75H2O showed certain increase in metallothionein production, which represents a specific response of the yeast species to the stress conditions. These results indicate that soil yeasts represent a potential for practical application in the bioremediation of contaminated environments.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000653d","authors":["Radi\u0107, Danka S.","Pavlovi\u0107, Vera P.","Lazovi\u0107, Milana M.","Jovi\u010di\u0107-Petrovi\u0107, Jelena P.","Karli\u010di\u0107, Vera M.","Lalevi\u0107, Bla\u017eo T.","Rai\u010devi\u0107, Vera B."],"doi":"10.1007\/s11356-017-9817-4","first_seen_on":"2017-08-06T21:48:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0944-1344","1614-7499"],"journal":"Environmental Science & Pollution Research","last_mentioned_on":1502056086,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28779342?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28779342","pubdate":"2017-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Copper-tolerant yeasts: Raman spectroscopy in determination of bioaccumulation mechanism","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":7203303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175176,"mean":11.996717202797,"rank":143223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175176,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2220,"mean":2.5516872465074,"rank":1444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2220,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":1.275,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/statuses\/894314163782041600","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23479059],"posted_on":"2017-08-06T21:48:06+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
