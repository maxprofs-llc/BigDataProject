Measles continues to be a major cause of child mortality globally, and rubella continues to be the leading infectious cause of birth defects. Measles and rubella eradication is feasible and cost saving. The obvious similarities in strategies between polio elimination and measles and rubella elimination include the use of an extensive surveillance and laboratory network, outbreak preparedness and response, extensive communications and social mobilization networks, and the need for periodic supplementary immunization activities. Polio staff and resources are already connected with those of measles and rubella, and transitioning existing capabilities to measles and rubella elimination efforts allows for optimized use of resources and the best opportunity to incorporate important lessons learned from polio eradication, and polio resources are concentrated in the countries with the highest burden of measles and rubella. Measles and rubella elimination strategies rely heavily on achieving and maintaining high vaccination coverage through the routine immunization activity infrastructure, thus creating synergies with immunization systems approaches, in what is termed a \"diagonal approach.\"","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","authors":["Kretsinger, Katrina","Strebel, Peter","Kezaala, Robert","Goodson, James L."],"doi":"10.1093\/infdis\/jix112","first_seen_on":"2017-08-06T17:37:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0022-1899","1537-6613"],"issue":"suppl_1","journal":"Journal of Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1502041024,"links":["https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jid\/article\/216\/suppl_1\/S308\/3935073\/Transitioning-Lessons-Learned-and-Assets-of-the?rss=1&utm_content=bufferd88ab&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jid\/article-pdf\/216\/suppl_1\/S308\/18251984\/jix112.pdf","pmid":"28838195","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"OUP accepted manuscript","type":"article","volume":"216","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transitioning-lessons-learned-assets-global-polio-eradication-initiative-global-regional-measles-rub"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":6322151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1128087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175124,"mean":12.000179508117,"rank":123654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175124,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6882,"mean":6.6298500217992,"rank":5983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":467,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6882,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":10.419696969697,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/postpolionews\/statuses\/894250987615129600","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23476973],"posted_on":"2017-08-06T17:37:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Post-Polio News","url":"https:\/\/www.post-polio.org.uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000571299619\/4fad51378685b137344ccbd5b7c9aee3_normal.png","description":"Incorporating NewsBites (Est. 1997) & Polio and Post-Polio News (Est. 2004).
