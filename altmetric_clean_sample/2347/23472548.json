On the one hand, RXRs through permissive heterodimerization with other NRs are able to integrate multiple lipid signaling pathways and are believed to play a central role to coordinate the development of the central nervous system. On the other hand, RXRs may have heterodimer-independent functions as well. Therefore, a more RXR-centric analysis is warranted to identify its genomic binding sites and regulated gene networks, which are orchestrating the earliest events in neuronal differentiation. Recently developed genome-wide approaches allow systematic analyses of the RXR-driven neural differentiation. Here we applied next generation sequencing-based methodology to track the dynamic redistribution of the RXR cistrome along the path of embryonic stem cell to glutamatergic neuron differentiation. We identified Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) and Liver X Receptor (LXR) as dominant heterodimeric partners of RXR in these cellular stages. Our data presented here characterize the RAR:RXR and LXR:RXR-mediated transcriptional program in embryonic stem cells, neural progenitors and terminally differentiated neurons. Considering the growing evidence for dysregulated RXR-mediated signaling in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, the data presented here will be also a valuable resource for the field of neuro(patho)biology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310e","authors":["Simandi, Zoltan","Horvath, Attila","Cuaranta-Monroy, Ixchelt","Sauer, Sascha","Deleuze, Jean-Francois","Nagy, Laszlo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mce.2017.07.033","first_seen_on":"2017-08-06T10:19:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0303-7207","1872-8057"],"journal":"Molecular & Cellular Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1502052128,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28778663?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28778663?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28778663","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","endocrinology"],"title":"RXR heterodimers orchestrate transcriptional control of neurogenesis and cell fate specification","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rxr-heterodimers-orchestrate-transcriptional-control-neurogenesis-cell-fate-specification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":3947672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4198680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175167,"mean":11.99729591359,"rank":79634,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":90204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175167,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1202,"mean":3.0005528726062,"rank":561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1202,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":0.80625,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Ph.
