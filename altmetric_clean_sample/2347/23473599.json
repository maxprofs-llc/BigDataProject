Close relatives were also involved to obtain an independent measure of the psychological dimensions investigated.\nCognitive status was very satisfactory with only mild Short Term Memory difficulties. The affective and well-being profile was characterized by mild signs of depression, good satisfaction with life and psychological well-being and a good personality development with patients perceiving themselves as stronger and better persons after illness. However patients reported higher emotional reactivity and psychological well-being measures were negatively affected by Epileptic Burden. Well-being was related to positive affective\/emotional functioning and unrelated to cognitive functioning. Good agreement between patients and relatives was found.\nIn the long term, patients operated for LGG showed good cognitive functioning, with no significant long-term cognitive sequelae for the extensive surgical approach. Psychologically, patients appear to experience a deep psychological change and maturation, closely resembling that of the so-called Post-Traumatic Growth which, to our knowledge, is for the first time described and quantified in LGG patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d13","authors":["Fabio Campanella","Alvisa Palese","Fabio Del Missier","Renzo Moreale","Tamara Ius","Tim Shallice","Franco Fabbro","Miran Skrap"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.wneu.2017.04.006","first_seen_on":"2017-08-06T12:01:14+00:00","issns":["18788750"],"journal":"World Neurosurgery","last_mentioned_on":1506522118,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.wneu.2017.04.006","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28411105?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28411105"],"pmid":"28411105","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"Long-Term Cognitive Functioning and Psychological Well-Being in Surgically Treated Patients with Low-Grade Glioma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-cognitive-functioning-psychological-wellbeing-surgically-treated-patients-lowgrade-glioma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":1.25,"1w":1.25,"6d":1.25,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":4275314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3968335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226794,"mean":12.731956365496,"rank":114415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":102330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226794,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1105,"mean":2.9694637681159,"rank":310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1105,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":2.0357264957265,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
