The aim of the study is to report on epidemiological, clinical, histological, and therapeutic characteristics of GISTs.\nA retrospective descriptive study of 29 cases of GIST in gastroenterology and general surgery departments of Mohamed Tahar Maamouri Hospital (Nabeul, Tunisia) was conducted from January 2005 to March 2012.\nAmong the 29 patients, there were 18 males (62%) and 11 females (38%) with a median age of 63 years (range, 30-96years). The main symptoms were abdominal pain (40%) and weight loss (28%). The tumour was revealed by a complication in 5 cases (17%). Six patients (20.7%) had metastatic lesions. The most common sites were the stomach (41.4%) and the small intestine (17.3%). The median tumour size was 9.5cm (range, 1-30cm). Spindle cell tumours were the main histological type (62%). KIT was positive in the majority of cases (75%). Twenty-one patients with primary disease (72%) underwent a surgical resection. Imatinib was prescribed in 7 patients (24%). Sunitinib malate was indicated in 3 patients who had tumour progression under imatinib. Median survival was 17 months (range, 1-69months). Ten patients died.\nThe management of GISTs has considerably evolved during the last years. Surgical resection, which remains the mainstay of treatment, was indicated in the majority of patients. Imatinib treatment has not improved overall survival in metastatic and\/or inoperable cases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006abf","authors":["Lamine Hamzaoui","Mouna Medhioub","Mahdi
