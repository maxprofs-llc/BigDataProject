The aim of this study was to develop a statistical model to test the correlation between utilisation and possible determinants in selected European countries.\nA sample of 31 medicines for cancer treatment that obtained EU-wide marketing authorisation between 2000 and 2012 was selected. Annual data on medicines' utilisation covering the\u00a0in- and out-patient public sectors were obtained from national authorities between 2008 and 2013. Possible determinants of utilisation were extracted from HTA reports and complemented by contacts with key informants. A longitudinal mixed effect model was fitted to test possible determinants of medicines utilisation in Belgium, Scotland and Sweden.\nIn the all-country model, the number of indications reimbursed positively correlated with increased consumption of medicines [one indication 2.6, 95% CI (1.8-3.6); two indications 2.4, 95% CI (1.4-4.3); three indications 4.9, 95% CI (2.2-10.9); all P\u00a0<\u00a00.01], years since EU-wide marketing authorisation [1.2, 95% CI (1.02-1.4); p\u00a0<\u00a00.05], price per DDD [0.9, 95% CI (0.998-0.999), P\u00a0<\u00a00.01], and Prescrire rating [0.5, 95% CI (0.3-0.9), P\u00a0<\u00a00.05] after adjusting for time and other covariates.\nIn this study, the most important correlates of increased utilisation in a sample of cancer medicines introduced in the past 15\u00a0years were: medicines coverage and\u00a0time since marketing authorisation. Prices had a negative effect on consumption in Belgium and Sweden. The positive impact of financial MEAs in Scotland suggests that the latter may remove the regressive effect of list prices on consumption.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000734e","authors":["Alessandra Ferrario","Ferrario, Alessandra"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10198-016-0855-5","first_seen_on":"2016-12-09T17:37:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1618-7601","1618-7598"],"journal":"The European Journal of Health Economics","last_mentioned_on":1485193240,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10198-016-0855-5","http:\/\/eprints.lse.ac.uk\/68806\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10198-016-0855-5.pdf","pmid":"27942986","pubdate":"2016-12-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["publichealth","healthservices"],"title":"Determinants of utilisation differences for cancer medicines in Belgium, Scotland and Sweden","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s10198-016-0855-5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/determinants-utilisation-differences-cancer-medicines-belgium-scotland-sweden"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8091619,"mean":6.8840984628706,"rank":2038828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4946507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8091619,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263764,"mean":12.250789762021,"rank":90126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":169257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263764,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":624,"mean":3.7086163723917,"rank":175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":624,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":3.5046875,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HealthEconBot\/statuses\/807277840681025536","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14617218],"posted_on":"2016-12-09T17:36:50+00:00","author":{"name":"HealthEconBot","url":"http:\/\/healtheconbot.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2633259384\/1a5f3e7665ed3a78e410c56e50392c40_normal.jpeg","description":"I am a bot.
