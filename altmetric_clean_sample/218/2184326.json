Herein, we review the available biological databases and automated\/semi-automated reconstruction tools. In addition, we describe available methodologies for the integration of high-throughput omics data to increase metabolic phenotype prediction accuracy. Data heterogeneity and lack of better integration of metabolic reconstruction pipelines with omics data generation protocols have hampered rapid progress thus far.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000269f","doi":"10.1016\/j.copbio.2014.02.011","first_seen_on":"2014-03-13T23:44:52+00:00","issns":["09581669"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1394754288,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0958166914000421"],"pmid":"24632194","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Recent advances in the reconstruction of metabolic models and integration of omics data","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recent-advances-reconstruction-metabolic-models-integration-omics-data"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3041480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":929092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107131,"mean":8.2615531037061,"rank":71328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":21725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107131,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":647,"mean":2.3957554179567,"rank":446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":647,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.1075,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":48,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Student  > Ph.
