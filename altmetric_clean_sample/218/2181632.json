The slow IAHP was suppressed by the selective L-type Ca2+ channel antagonists isradipine (2 microM) or nifedipine (10 microM). In contrast, neither omega-conotoxin MVIIA (1 microM) nor omega-agatoxin IVA (200 nM), N-type and P\/Q-type Ca2+ channel antagonists, respectively, attenuated this slow outward current. The slow IAHP was significantly reduced by thapsigargin (10 microM), a Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor that depletes intracellular Ca2+ stores, and by ryanodine (10-100 microM), which blocks Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular compartments. At this concentration thapsigargin did not modify high-threshold Ca2+ current, which was, however, blocked by isradipine. Thus, in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells, Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels is necessary to trigger the slow IAHP. Furthermore, intracellular Ca2+-activated Ca2+ stores represent a critical component in the transduction pathway leading to the generation of the slow IAHP.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e78","first_seen_on":"2014-03-13T12:35:07+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Neurophysiology","last_mentioned_on":1394714092,"links":["http:\/\/jn.physiology.org\/content\/80\/5\/2268"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jn.physiology.org\/content\/80\/5\/2268.full.pdf","pmid":"9819242","pubdate":"1998-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Physiological Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"title":"L-Type Ca2+ Channels Mediate the Slow Ca2+-Dependent Afterhyperpolarization Current in Rat CA3 Pyramidal Cells In Vitro","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ltype-ca2-channels-mediate-slow-ca2dependent-afterhyperpolarization-current-rat-ca3-pyramidal-cells-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7977957,"mean":6.7344362661252,"rank":6903291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7977957,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174559,"mean":7.60902595126,"rank":143386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174559,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3241,"mean":3.7493611111111,"rank":2881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3241,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.5910714285714,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
