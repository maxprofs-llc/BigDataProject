Mitochondria were suggested as a major source of the p66shc-mediated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We studied effects of p66shc on oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide or by serum deprivation in human colon carcinoma cell line RKO and in diploid human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). An shRNA-mediated knockdown of p66shc suppressed and an overexpression of a recombinant p66shc stimulated the production of ROS in the both models. This effect was not detected in the mitochondrial DNA-depleted \u03c10-RKO cells that do not have the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). The p66shc-dependent accumulation of mitochondrial ROS was detected with HyPer-mito, a mitochondria-targeted fluorescent protein sensor for hydrogen peroxide. The fragmentation of mitochondria induced by mitochondrial ROS was significantly reduced in the p66shc deficient RKO cells. Mitochondria-targeted antioxidants SkQ1 and SkQR1 also decreased the oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide or by serum deprivation. Together the data indicate that the p66shc-dependant ROS production during oxidative stress has mitochondrial origin in human normal and cancer cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Evgeny R.
