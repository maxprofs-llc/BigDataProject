In this study, the efficiency of N removal using E. crassipes in the lake was evaluated. After E. crassipes was planted in May, the concentrations of TN and NH4(+) in Waicaohai, the main part of Lake Caohai, were significantly decreased within a month, and then, remained stable from June to November, 2011, although the lake had received waste water continuously from river inlets. The average concentrations of TN, NH4(+)-N and NO3(-)-N in water of Xi Yuan Channel (outlet) were reduced to 3.3, 0.02 and 0.8mgL(-1) from 13.8, 4.7 and 5.8mgL(-1) in river inlets, respectively. The DO levels in 2011 were not decreased, but concentrations of TN and NH4(+) were significantly reduced when compared with the historical data from 2007 in the lake. Assimilation by E. crassipes was the main pathway to remove N in Lake Caohai, accounted for 52% of the total N influent (936t), or 64% of the removed N (761t). These results indicated that large scale utilization of E. crassipes for removal of N in the eutrophic lake is practicable.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024f7","authors":["Wang Z","Zhang Z","Zhang Y","Zhang J","Yan S","Guo J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chemosphere.2013.03.014","first_seen_on":"2014-03-14T20:20:16+00:00","issns":["0045-6535"],"issue":"","journal":"Chemosphere","last_mentioned_on":1394821980,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23582406"],"pmid":"23582406","pubdate":"2013-04-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biology","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Nitrogen removal from Lake Caohai, a typical ultra-eutrophic lake in China with large scale confined growth of Eichhornia crassipes.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nitrogen-removal-lake-caohai-typical-ultraeutrophic-lake-china-large-scale-confined-growth-eichhorni"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.104,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.104},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628714,"mean":4.9390391673343,"rank":391612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":3236963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628714,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93862,"mean":7.3705011453108,"rank":12354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":81507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93862,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":869,"mean":2.768633640553,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":869,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.9175,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Master":4,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":3,"Chemistry":2,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":5,"Unspecified":1,"Environmental Science":4,"Arts and Humanities":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CO":1,"CN":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Striking a Deal with the Weed from Hell","url":"http:\/\/conservationmagazine.org\/2014\/03\/water-hyacinth-in-kings-bay\/","citation_ids":[2186600],"posted_on":"2014-03-14T18:33:00+00:00","summary":"Water hyacinth is something of a wonder plant when it comes to ridding water of contaminants.
