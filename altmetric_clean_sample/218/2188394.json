Patients become bodies; both the faults and the virtues of the medical profession become exaggerated. This reconstruction has moral relevance: it is in part a moral blindness. The pain of medical training, together with its narrowness, contributes substantially to these faulty reconstructions. Possible improvements include teaching more social science, selecting chief residents and faculty for their attitudes, helping students acquire communication skills, and helping them deal with their own pain. Most importantly, clearer moral vision requires time and scope for reflection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e41","authors":["J Andre"],"first_seen_on":"2014-03-16T07:24:35+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0306-6800"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Medical Ethics","last_mentioned_on":1394996979,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/1404282\/?i=5&from=\/11658239\/related"],"pmcid":"PMC1376260","pmid":"1404282","pubdate":"1992-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Learning to see: moral growth during medical training.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/learning-see-moral-growth-during-medical-training"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229690,"mean":5.9663798423984,"rank":2549700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3543243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229690,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132754,"mean":8.3950858059706,"rank":55632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":72944,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132754,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1591,"mean":11.300910691824,"rank":1055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1591,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":9.4082727272727,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
