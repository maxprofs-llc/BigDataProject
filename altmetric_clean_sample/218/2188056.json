These otherwise unavailable intermediates add selectively to alkenes, alkynes, and (hetero)arenes, giving arylation products in a good yield. The reactions are photochemical alternatives of metal-catalyzed Heck and cross-coupling reactions and bear some mechanistic analogy with them.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000213f","authors":["Maurizio Fagnoni and"],"doi":"10.1021\/ar0402356","first_seen_on":"2014-03-15T22:36:53+00:00","issns":["0001-4842","1520-4898"],"issue":"9","journal":"Accounts of Chemical Research","last_mentioned_on":1394922882,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ar0402356"],"pmid":"16171314","pubdate":"2005-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Arylation Reactions:\u2009 The Photo-SN1 Path via Phenyl Cation as an Alternative to Metal Catalysis","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/arylation-reactions-photos-n1-path-via-phenyl-cation-alternative-metal-catalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228670,"mean":5.9649392979483,"rank":2926088,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1858377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228670,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132506,"mean":8.4731432021435,"rank":66451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":49033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132506,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1096,"mean":3.6667360730594,"rank":666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1096,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":2.5080526315789,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
