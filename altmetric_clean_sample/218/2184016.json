However, its contribution to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease is unclear. Here, we show that higher levels of Caspase-6 activity in the CA1 region of aged human hippocampi correlate with lower cognitive performance. To determine whether Caspase-6 activity, in the absence of plaques and tangles, is sufficient to cause memory deficits, we generated a transgenic knock-in mouse that expresses a self-activated form of human Caspase-6 in the CA1. This Caspase-6 mouse develops age-dependent spatial and episodic memory impairment. Caspase-6 induces neuronal degeneration and inflammation. We conclude that Caspase-6 activation in mouse CA1 neurons is sufficient to induce neuronal degeneration and age-dependent memory impairment. These results indicate that Caspase-6 activity in CA1 could be responsible for the lower cognitive performance of aged humans. Consequently, preventing or inhibiting Caspase-6 activity in the aged may provide an efficient novel therapeutic approach against Alzheimer disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c4","authors":["Leblanc AC","Ramcharitar J","Afonso V","Hamel E","Bennett DA","Pakavathkumar P","Albrecht S"],"doi":"10.1038\/cdd.2013.194","first_seen_on":"2014-03-13T21:20:31+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["1350-9047"],"issue":"","journal":"Cell Death & Differentiation","last_mentioned_on":1390838880,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24413155"],"pmid":"24413155","pubdate":"2014-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Macmillan Publishers Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Caspase-6 activity in the CA1 region of the hippocampus induces age-dependent memory impairment.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/caspase6-activity-ca1-region-hippocampus-induces-agedependent-memory-impairment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.016,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.016},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":598337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3029409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93949,"mean":7.3177539064165,"rank":17774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":76164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93949,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":699,"mean":3.6864498567335,"rank":166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":699,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.3190476190476,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
