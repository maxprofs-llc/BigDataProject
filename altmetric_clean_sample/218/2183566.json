The procedure uses TEMPO, a basic additive, and dioxygen gas as the terminal oxidant. This reaction demonstrates better reactivity, functional group tolerance, and broader scope than comparable metal catalyzed reactions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Hu, Jiantao","Xu, Huacheng","Nie, Pengju","Xie, Xiaobo","Nie, Zongxiu","Rao, Yu"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201304923","endpage":"3938","first_seen_on":"2014-03-13T19:22:05+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3765","0947-6539"],"issue":"14","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1394109720,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201304923\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201304923\/pdf","pmid":"24590598","pubdate":"2014-03-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"3932","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis of Indazoles and Azaindazoles by Intramolecular Aerobic Oxidative C\uf8ffN Coupling under Transition\u2010Metal Free Conditions","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-indazoles-azaindazoles-intramolecular-aerobic-oxidative-cn-coupling-under-transitionmetalf"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.624,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.624},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628496,"mean":4.94108381299,"rank":530478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3097569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628496,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93839,"mean":7.3367883799742,"rank":16329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":77484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93839,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2131,"mean":2.953938028169,"rank":485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":1639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2131,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":3.6222,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
