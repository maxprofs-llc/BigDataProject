The organically passivated Ni nanospheres show a large magnetic entropy change of 0.9 J\u2009kg(-1) \u2009K for a 3 T magnetic field change. In comparison to the surfactant-coated Ni nanoparticles, the Ni(core)Ag(shell) nanoparticles show an enhanced coercivity, magnetization, and magnetocaloric effect (1.3 kg\u2009K for a 3 T magnetic field change). The coercivity at 10 K increases from 360 Oe for Ni nanoparticles to nearly 610 Oe for Ni(core)Ag(shell) particles. This large enhancement is attributed to the enhanced inter-particle interaction, which is mediated by the metallic shell, over the relatively weaker dipolar interaction in the surfactant-coated Ni nanoparticles, and to modification of the surface spin structure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dda","authors":["Sanyadanam Srinath","Pankaj Poddar","Raja Das","Deepti Sidhaye","Bhagavatula Lakshmi Vara Prasad","James Gass","Hariharan Srikanth","Srinath, Sanyadanam","Poddar, Pankaj","Das, Raja","Sidhaye, Deepti","Prasad, Bhagavatula Lakshmi Vara","Gass, James","Srikanth, Hariharan"],"doi":"10.1002\/cphc.201300886","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2014-03-13T21:07:18+00:00","issns":["14394235","1439-4235","1439-7641"],"issue":"8","journal":"ChemPhysChem","last_mentioned_on":1394523195,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201300886\/abstract;jsessionid=43571E95325B23BF792FA358A5E4F6A8.f03t01?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+Saturday%2C+15+March+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+GMT+%2806%3A00-08%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201300886\/pdf","pmid":"24615843","pubdate":"2014-03-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
