Our paper contributes to the literature by providing evidence in the context of China, focusing on smoking behaviour.\nThis paper studies the intergenerational transmission of smoking in the context of China using a nationally representative dataset - the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). The two-part model, the Tobit model, and the fixed effects model are utilized for the empirical analysis, respectively.\nWe found a strong intergenerational persistence of health behaviour. That is, parents' smoking behaviour is positively correlated with their children's smoking initiation.\nOur study provides evidence of the intergenerational persistence of health behaviour in the case of smoking, in the world's most populous country. This has policy implications for the issue of intergenerational mobility and health education, as well as for tobacco control in China.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d8","authors":["Jay Pan","Wei Han","Jay Pan","Wei Han"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12889-017-4480-8","first_seen_on":"2017-06-13T05:36:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2458"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1497333597,"links":["https:\/\/bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12889-017-4480-8"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12889-017-4480-8?site=bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28595640","pubdate":"2017-06-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biostatistics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Epidemiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Vaccine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"557","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Exploring the intergenerational persistence of health behaviour: an empirical study of smoking from China","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exploring-intergenerational-persistence-health-behaviour-empirical-study-smoking-china"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":1.1,"6m":1.1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":4430192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3901372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241800,"mean":12.626752501044,"rank":132387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":107877,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241800,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7008,"mean":9.1621772513201,"rank":5143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1845,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7008,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187,"mean":21.711795698925,"rank":140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CN":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/chinamedicine\/statuses\/874500541077901312","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21024818],"posted_on":"2017-06-13T05:35:51+00:00","author":{"name":"China Medical News","url":"http:\/\/www.chinesemedicalnews.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/473812471711416320\/VOoO59TW_normal.jpeg","description":"Independent news on medicine and healthcare in China, by medical journalist Michael Woodhead","id_on_source":"chinamedicine","tweeter_id":"946587205","geo":{"lt":35,"ln":105,"country":"CN"},"followers":1818},"tweet_id":"874500541077901312"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/XimenYiliao\/statuses\/874506606578249728","license":"gnip","rt":["chinamedicine"],"citation_ids":[21024818],"posted_on":"2017-06-13T05:59:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Simon Mellon","url":"http:\/\/GREAT.gov.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/829382669091770368\/l8Nle7xQ_normal.jpg","description":"Leading the Department for International Trade's Life Sciences, Health and Social Care team in South China.
