A Training Model for Improving Journalists' Voice.

The main concerns about such education are that, first, there is little awareness of the importance of voice education, and second there is little research devoted to it. The consequences of this lack of training are indeed visible in professionals who suffer voice pathologies or work with little effectiveness. This study seeks to overcome this deficiency by proposing a training model tested with a control group and a pilot study. Speech samples from a group of experimental participants-journalism students-were collected before and after a training course designed to improve their main vocal and prosodic features. These samples were contrasted with a control group without training. Results indicated significant differences in all tested voice elements (breathing, articulation, loudness, pitch, jitter, speech rate, pauses, and stress) except for shimmer and harmonics. The participants were able to enhance their main vocal and prosodic elements, and therefore their expressiveness maintaining optimal vocal hygiene.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ada","authors":["Emma Rodero","Celia Diaz-Rodriguez","Olatz Larrea"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jvoice.2017.05.006","first_seen_on":"2017-06-13T07:20:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["08921997"],"journal":"Journal of Voice","last_mentioned_on":1498025005,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0892199716305331","http:\/\/www.jvoice.org\/article\/S0892-1997(16)30533-1\/fulltext"],"pmid":"28599996","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Performing Arts And Creative Writing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Health Professions"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"A Training Model for Improving Journalists' Voice","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/training-model-improving-journalists-voice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":2.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":3549158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4800949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243677,"mean":12.700361791887,"rank":94740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":146332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243677,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":799,"mean":2.2010250626566,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":618,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":799,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":0.69824561403509,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Neuroscience":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1,"IT":1},"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EmmaRodero\/statuses\/874526946847330304","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21026569],"posted_on":"2017-06-13T07:20:46+00:00","author":{"name":"EMMA RODERO","url":"http:\/\/emmarodero.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/801896006984011776\/OeCLpXW1_normal.jpg","description":"Radio, Voice and Public Speaking Professor and Researcher. \nI know how your voice impacts on the listener","id_on_source":"EmmaRodero","tweeter_id":"156567521","geo":{"lt":41.38879,"ln":2.15899,"country":"ES"},"followers":807},"tweet_id":"874526946847330304"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/V_Carlile\/statuses\/877406509373820928","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21026569],"posted_on":"2017-06-21T06:03:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Valentina Carlile","url":"http:\/\/www.valentinacarlile.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/830468398018678784\/0SxLWnuK_normal.jpg","description":"DO specialized in ENT and Voice disorders.
