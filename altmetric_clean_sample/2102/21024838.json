Structural analysis shows the single-crystalline nature of the grown whiskers. To probe electrical properties, we exfoliate these whiskers into thin flakes (~50\u2009nm thick) using the scotch-tape technique and develop a process to realize good electrical contacts. We observe a superconducting critical temperature, T c , of 86\u2009K. We map the evolution of the critical current as a function of temperature. With 2-D materials emerging as an exciting platform to study low-dimensional physics, our work paves the way for future studies on two-dimensional high-T c superconductivity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Apoorv Jindal","Digambar A.
