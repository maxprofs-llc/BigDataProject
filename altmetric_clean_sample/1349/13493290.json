Each month, a 30- to 45-minute video featuring a pediatric critical care medicine expert, interspersed with questions for the audience, is released. Viewers contribute to the community discussion by leaving comments that display alongside the video. Clinicians are encouraged to asynchronously host an educational conference so they can watch the videos and participate in the discussion together.\nFrom March 2013-November 2015, 28 WSPs were launched on a variety of topics. They were viewed over 18,414 times by 1,864 viewers in 132 countries and 760 hospitals; 1,155 comments were submitted. Attending physicians\/consultants were the largest audience (36% [671\/1,864]), and 37% (30\/81) of responding viewers that commented in WSPs watched in small groups. The WSP series was reported to add value to respondents' learning or teaching and to have had a positive impact on their knowledge or practice.\nFuture research will focus on further describing the context and structure of the CoP and on more deeply investigating its higher-level outcomes and impact. More work is needed to identify barriers and strategies that improve online community engagement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056af","authors":["Wolbrink, Traci A.","Kissoon, Niranjan","Mirza, Nabila","Burns, Jeffrey P.","Traci A.
