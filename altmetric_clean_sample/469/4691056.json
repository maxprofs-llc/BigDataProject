Its activity is required for homolog pairing and synapsis and for double-strand break formation, but how it drives and coordinates these pathways to ensure crossover formation remains unknown. Here we show that CHK-2 promotes pairing and synapsis by phosphorylating a family of zinc finger proteins that bind to specialized regions on each chromosome known as pairing centers, priming their recruitment of the Polo-like kinase PLK-2. This knowledge enabled the development of a phospho-specific antibody as a tool to monitor CHK-2 activity. When either synapsis or crossover formation is impaired, CHK-2 activity is prolonged, and meiotic progression is delayed. We show that this common feedback circuit is mediated by interactions among a network of HORMA domain proteins within the chromosome axis and generates a graded signal. These findings reveal conserved regulatory mechanisms that ensure faithful meiotic chromosome segregation in diverse species.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f0","authors":["Kim, Yumi","Kostow, Nora","Dernburg, Abby F"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.devcel.2015.09.021","first_seen_on":"2015-10-28T14:04:02+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1878-1551","1534-5807"],"issue":"2","journal":"Developmental Cell","last_mentioned_on":1455108187,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26506311","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/developmental-cell\/abstract\/S1534-5807(15)00622-X","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26506311?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26506311?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26506311?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26506311","pubdate":"2015-10-28T22:00:11+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["embryology","cellbiology"],"title":"The Chromosome Axis Mediates Feedback Control of CHK-2 to Ensure Crossover Formation in C.\u00a0elegans","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chromosome-axis-mediates-feedback-control-chk2-ensure-crossover-formation-c-elegans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7168681,"mean":6.3131530881527,"rank":2699630,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4416884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7168681,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238175,"mean":9.5027238825396,"rank":78251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":157771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238175,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2018,"mean":7.8180862667328,"rank":955,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":1031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2018,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":17.288736842105,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
