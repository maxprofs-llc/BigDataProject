Our objective was to test for the presence and pathogenicity of anti-AQP4 antibodies in SLE patients without neurological disease. Sera from 89 non-CNS-SLE patients were screened for anti-AQP4 autoantibodies. Two of the 89 patients were positive. Archived samples dating back 11years were also positive. A brain and spinal cord MRI did not reveal any NMOSD-compatible lesions. An in vitro cytotoxicity assay showed that either sera or purified IgG from these patients induced a complement-mediated damage in cultured astrocytes comparable to antibodies obtained from typical NMO patients. We conclude that AQP4-antibodies can be present in SLE patients and persist for many years, without concurrent clinical or radiological NMOSD signs. It is unclear why the anti-AQP4 antibodies did not induce CNS disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e75","authors":["Alexopoulos, Harry","Kampylafka, Eleni I","Fouka, Penelope","Tatouli, Ioanna","Akrivou, Sofia","Politis, Panagiotis K","Moutsopoulos, Haralampos M","Tzioufas, Athanasios G","Dalakas, Marinos C"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jneuroim.2015.10.007","first_seen_on":"2015-10-28T17:36:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01655728","1872-8421"],"journal":"Journal of Neuroimmunology","last_mentioned_on":1458670835,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0165572815300515&_version=1&md5=0a4a950d9629382785bd5eb465fb237b","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26616866?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26616866","pubdate":"2015-12-01T22:00:54+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Neuroscience"],"title":"Anti-aquaporin-4 autoantibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus persist for years and induce astrocytic cytotoxicity but not CNS disease ","type":"article","volume":"289","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiaquaporin4-autoantibodies-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-persist-years-induce-astrocytic-cytotoxic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7424901,"mean":6.4566625821178,"rank":3273991,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4078114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7424901,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239224,"mean":9.5580546853772,"rank":96361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":138483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239224,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":877,"mean":2.9312397260274,"rank":371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":877,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":2.5240869565217,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
