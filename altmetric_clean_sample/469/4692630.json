Complete complex speciation at different metal-to-ligand molar ratios ranging from 1\u2009:\u20091 to 3\u2009:\u20091 was obtained. Over a wide 6-8 pH range, including physiological pH 7.4, and a 1\u2009:\u20091 metal-to-ligand molar ratio, the peptides studied formed a CuH-1L complex with the 4N{NH2,N(-),2NIm} coordination mode. The presence of the 4N binding site for the CuH-1L complexes prevented the deprotonation and coordination of the second amide nitrogen atom to copper(ii) ions (pK-1\/-2 7.83-8.07) compared to that of pentaGly (6.81). The amine nitrogen donor and two imidazole nitrogen atoms (H(6)H(9), H(6)H(12) and H(9)H(12)) can be considered to be independent metal-binding sites in the species formed. As a consequence, di- and trinuclear complexes for the metal-to-ligand 2\u2009:\u20091 and 3\u2009:\u20091 molar ratios dominate in the solution, respectively. For the Cu(ii)-H1A\/H9A and Cu(ii)-H1A\/H12A systems, the Cu3H-9L complexes are likely formed by the coordination of amide nitrogen atoms towards C-termini with ring sizes (7,5,5).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Agnieszka Kadej","Mariola Kuczer","Teresa Kowalik-Jankowska"],"doi":"10.1039\/c5dt01911g","endpage":"20674","first_seen_on":"2015-10-28T14:57:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"47","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1446044223,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/DT\/C5DT01911G?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2015\/dt\/c5dt01911g","pmid":"26565558","pubdate":"2015-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"20659","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Copper(II) complexes of terminally free alloferon mutants containing two histidyl binding sites inside peptide chain Structure and Stability","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/copper-scpiiscp-complexes-terminally-free-alloferon-mutants-containing-two-histidyl-binding-sites-in"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6499474,"mean":6.0204226850388,"rank":5543746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6499474,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207266,"mean":10.262342788218,"rank":164851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207266,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9915,"mean":0.64928484970748,"rank":2741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9915,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":700,"mean":0.60636623748212,"rank":238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":700,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/659383379217903616","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4692630],"posted_on":"2015-10-28T14:57:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1295},"tweet_id":"659383379217903616"}]}}
