The aim of this study is to examine the longitudinal stability of anxiety disorder diagnoses, and the difference in stability between subjects with a chronic versus a non-chronic course.\nLongitudinal data of 447 subjects with a current pure anxiety disorder diagnosis at baseline from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were used. At baseline, 2-, 4-, and 6-year follow-up mental disorders were assessed and numbers (and percentages) of transitions from one anxiety disorder diagnosis to another were determined for each anxiety disorder diagnosis separately and for subjects with a chronic (i.e. one or more anxiety disorder at every follow-up assessment) and a non-chronic course.\nTransition percentages were high in all anxiety disorder diagnoses, ranging from 21.1% for social anxiety disorder to 46.3% for panic disorder with agoraphobia at six years of follow-up. Transition numbers were higher in the chronic than in the non-chronic course group (p=0.01).\nDue to the 2 year sample frequency, the number of subjects with a chronic course may have been overestimated as intermittent recovery periods may have been missed.\nThese data indicate that anxiety disorder diagnoses are not stable over time. The validity of the different anxiety disorder categories is not supported by these longitudinal patterns, which may be interpreted as support for a more pronounced dimensional approach to the classification of anxiety disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c6c","authors":["Hovenkamp-Hermelink, Johanna Hm","Riese, Harri\u00ebtte","van der Veen, Date C","Batelaan, Neeltje M","Penninx, Brenda Wjh","Schoevers, Robert A","Johanna HM Hovenkamp-Hermelink","Harri\u00ebtte Riese","Date C van der Veen","Neeltje M Batelaan","Brenda WJH Penninx","Robert A Schoevers"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jad.2015.10.035","endpage":"315","first_seen_on":"2015-10-29T02:53:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0165-0327","1573-2517","01650327"],"journal":"Journal of Affective Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1447319439,"links":["http:\/\/www.jad-journal.com\/article\/S0165-0327(15)30616-9\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0165032715306169"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jad-journal.com\/article\/S0165032715306169\/pdf","pmid":"26544613","pubdate":"2015-11-07T22:00:17+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"310","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Low stability of diagnostic classifications of anxiety disorders over time: A six-year follow-up of the NESDA study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0165032715306169","volume":"190","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/low-stability-diagnostic-classifications-anxiety-disorders-time-sixyear-followup-nesda-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6562576,"mean":6.081396308004,"rank":2712049,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3701342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6562576,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208168,"mean":10.289178621011,"rank":93390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":108024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208168,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3438,"mean":5.4407506546407,"rank":1718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":1595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3438,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191,"mean":5.0966105263158,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
