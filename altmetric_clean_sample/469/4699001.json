However, most stem cells are washed out immediately after ICI. The goal of this study is to investigate using magnetic nanoparticles (NanoShuttle) to maintain stem cells in the corpus cavernosum (CC) after ICI, thereby improving stem cell therapy for ED in an animal model.\nAdipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) were magnetized with NanoShuttle to create Nano-ADSCs. 24 rats were performed bilateral cavernous nerve crush (BCNC) and randomly assigned into three groups: ADSCs, Nano-ADSCs, and Nano-ADSCs + magnet. Cells were tracked at days 1, 3, 5 and 9 after ICI. Another 40 BCNC rats were randomly assigned into 4 groups: BCNC, BCNC + ADSCs ICI, BCNC + Nano-ADSCs ICI, and BCNC + Nano-ADSCs ICI + magnet. Functional testing and histologic analysis were performed four weeks after ICI.\nIn vitro study: 1. NanoShuttle was successfully bound to ADSCs. 2. Nano-ADSCs migrated toward the magnet. In vivo study: 1. Cell tracking showed that Nano-ADSCs were successfully retained in the CC with the use of the magnet for up to 3 days, while most ADSCs were washed out in other groups by day 1 after ICI. 2. ICP\/MAP and the expressions of \u03b1SMA and PECAM-1 in the Nano-ADSCs group were significantly higher than other groups.\nMagnetization of ADSCs with NanoShuttle kept ADSCs in the CC and improved ADSC therapy for ED in an animal model.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f12","authors":["Lin, Haocheng","Dhanani, Nadeem","Tseng, Hubert","Souza, Glauco R","Wang, Grace","Cao, Yanna","Ko, Tien C","Jiang, Hui","Wang, Run"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.juro.2015.10.129","first_seen_on":"2015-10-29T02:31:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-5347","1527-3792"],"journal":"The Journal of Urology","last_mentioned_on":1460374673,"links":["http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S0022-5347(15)05149-6\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S0022-5347%2815%2905149-6\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S0022534715051496\/pdf","pmid":"26519654","pubdate":"2015-11-01T22:00:10+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Nanoparticle Improved Stem Cell Therapy for Erectile Dysfunction in a Rat Model of Cavernous Nerve Injury","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nanoparticle-improved-stem-cell-therapy-erectile-dysfunction-rat-model-cavernous-nerve-injury-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7534762,"mean":6.5107844469081,"rank":2944222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4535904,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7534762,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239246,"mean":9.5847584944303,"rank":79444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":157535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239246,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7714,"mean":4.3390154284973,"rank":2885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4718,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7714,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":357,"mean":5.5381460674157,"rank":151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":357,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
