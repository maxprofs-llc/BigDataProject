Nevertheless, achieving high capacity and cycling stability remains a great challenge. Here, uniform yolk-shell iron sulfide-carbon nanospheres have been synthesized as cathode materials for the emerging sodium sulfide battery to achieve remarkable capacity of \u223c545\u2009mA\u2009h\u2009g(-1) over 100 cycles at 0.2\u2009C (100\u2009mA\u2009g(-1)), delivering ultrahigh energy density of \u223c438\u2009Wh\u2009kg(-1). The proven conversion reaction between sodium and iron sulfide results in high capacity but severe volume changes. Nanostructural design, including of nanosized iron sulfide yolks (\u223c170\u2009nm) with porous carbon shells (\u223c30\u2009nm) and extra void space (\u223c20\u2009nm) in between, has been used to achieve excellent cycling performance without sacrificing capacity. This sustainable sodium-iron sulfide battery is a promising candidate for stationary energy storage. Furthermore, this spatially confined sulfuration strategy offers a general method for other yolk-shell metal sulfide-carbon composites.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Yun-Xiao Wang","Jianping Yang","Shu-Lei Chou","Hua Kun Liu","Wei-xian Zhang","Dongyuan Zhao","Shi Xue Dou"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms9689","first_seen_on":"2015-10-29T01:42:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1733","2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1446173887,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncomms\/2015\/151028\/ncomms9689\/full\/ncomms9689.html"],"pmid":"26507613","pubdate":"2015-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"Uniform yolk-shell iron sulfide-carbon nanospheres for superior sodium-iron sulfide batteries","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/uniform-yolkshell-iron-sulfidecarbon-nanospheres-superior-sodiumiron-sulfide-batteries"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6507444,"mean":6.0294063692903,"rank":2407820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4002056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6507444,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207055,"mean":10.27148588291,"rank":80523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":122730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207055,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9893,"mean":38.162349979782,"rank":7053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":2638,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9893,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":763,"mean":47.05388976378,"rank":567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":763,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
