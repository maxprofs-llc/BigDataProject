Thus, targeted inhibition of LINGO-1 via RNA interference may enhance transplanted neural stem cell survival and neuronal differentiation in vivo. Furthermore, LINGO-1 RNA interference in neural stem cells represents a potential therapeutic strategy for spinal cord injury.\nDepartment of Spine Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University.\nTranslational Medicine Center Research Laboratory, First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University.\nFemale Sprague-Dawley rats.\nThe animals were divided into three groups that underwent laminectomy and complete spinal cord transection accompanied by transplantation of control-RNA interference-treated or LINGO-1-RNA interference-treated neural stem cells at the injured site in vivo. In vitro, neural stem cells were divided into four groups for the following treatments: control, control RNA interference lentivirus, LINGO-1 RNA interference lentivirus and LINGO-1 complementary DNA lentivirus.\nNeural stem cells in each treatment group were examined for cell survival and neuronal differentiation in vitro and in vivo via immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Axonal regeneration and tissue repair were assessed via retrograde tracing using Fluorogold, electron microscopy, hematoxylin-eosin staining and MRI. Rats were also examined for functional recovery based on the measurement of spinal cord-evoked potentials and the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan score. LINGO-1-RNA interference-treated neural stem cell transplantation increased tissue repair and functional recovery of the injured spinal cord in rats. Similarly, LINGO-1 RNA interference increased neural stem cell survival and neuronal differentiation in vitro. The mechanism underlying the effect of LINGO-1 RNA interference on the injured rat spinal cord may be that the significant inhibition of LINGO-1 expression in neural stem cells inactivated the RhoA and Notch signaling pathways, which act downstream of LINGO-1.\nOur findings indicate that transplantation of LINGO-1-RNA interference-treated neural stem cells facilitates functional recovery after spinal cord injury and represents a promising potential strategy for the repair of spinal cord injury.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000263f","authors":["Chen, Ningning","Jing-Sheng, Cen","Jingnan, Wang","Gangjian, Qin","Lingli, Long","Le, Wang","Fuxin, Wei","Qingfeng, Xiang","David, Y B Deng","Yong, Wan"],"doi":"10.1097\/ccm.0000000000001351","first_seen_on":"2015-10-28T16:25:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1530-0293","0090-3493"],"journal":"Critical Care Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1446049538,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ccmjournal\/pages\/articleviewer.aspx?year=9000&issue=00000&article=97115&type=abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ccmjournal\/9000\/00000\/Targeted_Inhibition_of_Leucine_Rich_Repeat_and.97115.pdf","pmid":"26491860","pubdate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["criticalcare"],"title":"Targeted Inhibition of Leucine-Rich Repeat and Immunoglobulin Domain-Containing Protein 1 in Transplanted Neural Stem Cells Promotes Neuronal Differentiation and Functional Recovery in Rats Subjected to Spinal Cord Injury.","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeted-inhibition-leucinerich-repeat-immunoglobulin-domaincontaining-protein-1-transplanted-neural-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6500718,"mean":6.0222432796255,"rank":5544784,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6500718,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207323,"mean":10.26254522916,"rank":164944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207323,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3868,"mean":7.1929868114818,"rank":3443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3868,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184,"mean":9.2693333333333,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/celltherapynews\/statuses\/659405675374714880","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4695501],"posted_on":"2015-10-28T16:25:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Cell Therapy News","url":"http:\/\/www.celltherapynews.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/748289281672642560\/ULgWUrkm_normal.jpg","description":"The online resource for cell and gene therapy research.
