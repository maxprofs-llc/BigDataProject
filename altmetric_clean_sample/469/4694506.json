The IFN-\u03bb induced by TLR3 and RIG-I activation of End1\/E6E7 cells was also examined by real-time PCR and ELISA. HSV-2 infection of End1\/E6E7 cells was evaluated by the real-time PCR detection of HSV-2 gD expression. The antibody to IL-10R\u03b2 was used to determine whether IFN-\u03bb contributes to TLR3\/RIG-I mediated HSV-2 inhibition. Expression of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7, IFN-stimulated gene 56 (ISG56), 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase I (OAS-1) and myxovirus resistance A (MxA) were determined by the real-time PCR and Western-blot. End1\/E6E7 cells were transfected with shRNA to knockdown the IRF3, IRF7 or RIG-I expression. Student's t-test and post Newman-Keul's test were used to analyze stabilized differences in the immunological parameters above between TLR3\/RIG-I-activated cells and control cells.\nHuman cervical epithelial cells expressed functional TLR3 and RIG-I, which could be activated by poly I:C and 5'ppp double-strand RNAs (5'ppp dsRNA), resulting in the induction of endogenous interferon lambda (IFN-\u03bb). The induced IFN-\u03bb contributed to TLR3\/RIG-I-mediated inhibition of HSV-2 replication in human cervical epithelial cells, as an antibody to IL-10R\u03b2, an IFN-\u03bb receptor subunit, could compromise TLR3\/RIG-I-mediated inhibition of HSV-2. Further studies showed that TLR3\/RIG-I signaling in the cervical epithelial cells by dsRNA induced the expression of the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), ISG56, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase I (OAS-1) and myxovirus resistance A (MxA), the key antiviral elements in the IFN signaling pathway. In addition, we observed that the topical treatment of genital mucosa with poly I:C could protect mice from genital HSV-2 infection.\nFuture prospective studies with primary cells and suitable animal models are needed in order to confirm these outcomes.\nThe findings provide direct and compelling evidence that there is intracellular expression and regulation of IFN-\u03bb in human cervical epithelial cells, which may have a key role in the innate genital protection against viral infections.Large scale data: Not applicable.\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81301428 to L.Z. and 81271334 to W-Z.
