The number of operating rooms (ORs) needed to minimize waiting time while optimizing resources can be determined using queuing theory and computer simulation. We developed a computer program using Monte Carlo simulation to determine the number of ORs needed to minimize patient wait times while optimizing resources.\nWe used patient arrival data and surgical procedure length from our institution, a tertiary-care academic medical center that serves a large diverse population. With ~4800 patients\/year requiring non-elective surgery, and mean procedure length 185\u00a0min (median 150\u00a0min) we determined the number of ORs needed during the day and evening (0600-2200) and during the night (2200-0600) that resulted in acceptable wait times.\nSimulation of 4 ORs at day\/evening and 3 ORs at night resulted in median wait time\u2009=\u20090\u00a0min (mean\u2009=\u200919\u00a0min) for emergency cases requiring surgery within 2\u00a0h, with wait time at the 95th percentile\u2009=\u2009109\u00a0min. Median wait time for urgent cases needing surgery within 8-12\u00a0h was 34\u00a0min (mean\u2009=\u2009136\u00a0min), with wait time at the 95th percentile\u2009=\u2009474\u00a0min. The effect of changes in surgical length and volume on wait times was determined with sensitivity analysis.\nMonte Carlo simulation can guide decisions on how to balance resources for elective and non-elective surgical procedures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bb","authors":["Joseph MOB Antognini","Joseph F Antognini","Vijay Khatri"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12913-015-1148-x","first_seen_on":"2015-10-29T09:32:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1472-6963"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Health Services Research","last_mentioned_on":1447027200,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/15\/487","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/s12913-015-1148-x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12913-015-1148-x.pdf","pmid":"26507265","pubdate":"2015-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Health Administration","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Informatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nursing Management\/Nursing Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"487","subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"How many operating rooms are needed to manage non-elective surgical cases?
