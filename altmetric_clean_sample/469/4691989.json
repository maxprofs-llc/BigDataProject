A ceria-supported ruthenium catalyst promotes the reaction efficiently, even with an ambient pressure of CO or without external CO, thus giving the corresponding \u03b3-hydroxybutenolide derivatives in good to high yields. Moreover this catalyst can be reused with no loss of activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Miura, Hiroki","Takeuchi, Kazuki","Shishido, Tetsuya"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201507814","endpage":"282","first_seen_on":"2015-10-28T14:34:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773"],"issue":"1","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
