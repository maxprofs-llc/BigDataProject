Dementia-related gait changes (DRGC) mainly include decrease in walking speed provoked by a decrease in stride length and an increase in support phase. More recently, dual-task related changes in gait were found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-Alzheimer dementia, even at an early stage. An increase in stride-to-stride variability while usual walking and dual-tasking has been shown to be more specific and sensitive than any change in mean value in subjects with dementia. Those data show that DRGC are not only associated to motor disorders but also to problem with central processing of information and highlight that dysfunction of temporal and frontal lobe may in part explain gait impairment among demented subjects. Gait assessment, and more particularly dual-task analysis, is therefore crucial in early diagnosis of dementia and\/or related syndromes in the elderly. Moreover, dual-task disturbances could be a specific marker of falling at a pre-dementia stage.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082a9","authors":["Olivier Beauchet","Gilles Allali","Gilles Berrut","Caroline Hommet","V\u00e9ronique Dubost","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Assal"],"first_seen_on":"2013-05-28T19:31:06+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1367010135,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2515920\/"],"pmid":"18728766","pubdate":"2008-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"155","title":"Gait analysis in demented subjects: Interests and perspectives","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gait-analysis-demented-subjects-interests-perspectives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616414,"mean":4.9310398369908,"rank":2902403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616414,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85362,"mean":6.9876608521456,"rank":67632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85362,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":673,"mean":3.3728303571429,"rank":571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":673,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":3.6181071428571,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
