He was noted to have T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) analysis below the cutoff for normal on newborn screening and T cell lymphopenia on further immunologic evaluation. A novel, presumably pathogenic de novo 3\u2009bp deletion in exon 7 of TP63 (c.970_972delATT; NCBI Reference Sequence NM_003722.4) was identified. This observation provides supporting evidence for the association between TP63 mutations and EECUT plus syndrome. Clinicians caring for infants presenting with EEC spectrum disorders in the newborn period should also consider the possibility of T cell lymphopenia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f61000697d","authors":["Giampietro PF","Baker MW","Basehore MJ","Jones JR","Seroogy CM","Giampietro, Philip F.","Baker, Mei W.","Basehore, Monica J.","Jones, Julie R.","Seroogy, Christine M."],"doi":"10.1002\/ajmg.a.35885","endpage":"1435","first_seen_on":"2013-05-26T15:40:41+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1552-4833","1552-4825"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Medical Genetics.
