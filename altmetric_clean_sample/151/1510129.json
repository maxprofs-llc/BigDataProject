The 15q11.2-q14 deletion encompassed the 15q11.2-q13 Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) critical region and the recently described 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome region while the 5pter deletion contained no RefSeq genes. From our literature review, patients with similar deletions in chromosome 15q exhibit expanded phenotype of severe developmental delay, protracted feeding problem, absent speech, central visual impairment, congenital malformations and epilepsy in addition to those typical of PWS. The patient reported herein had previously unreported anomalies of mega cisterna magna, horseshoe kidney and the rare neonatal interstitial lung disease known as pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis. Precise breakpoint delineation by microarray is useful in patients with atypical PWS deletions to guide investigation and prognostication.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f61000697d","authors":["Liu, Anthony P.Y.","Tang, Wing Fai","Lau, Elizabeth T.","Chan, Kelvin Y.K.","Kan, Anita S.Y.","Wong, Kar Yin","Tso, Winnie W.Y.","Jalal, Khair","Lee, So Lun","Chau, Christy S.K.","Chung, Brian H.Y."],"doi":"10.1002\/ajmg.a.35909","endpage":"1318","first_seen_on":"2013-05-26T02:35:25+00:00","funders":["wellcome"],"issns":["1552-4833","1552-4825"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Medical Genetics.
