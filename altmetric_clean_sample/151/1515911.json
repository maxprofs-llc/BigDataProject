Twenty isolates of imipenem-resistant A. baumannii from an equal number of patients with nosocomial infections were obtained. Primers were used to amplify genes bla IMP, bla VIM, bla OXA-23, bla OXA-24, bla OXA-58, bla OXA-51 and bla ADC-7. To detect insertion sequences ISAba1\/bla OXA-23, ISAba1\/bla OXA-51 and ISAba1\/bla ADC-7, mapping by PCR using combinations of reverse primers ISAba1 and reverse primers of bla OXA-23, bla OXA-51 and bla ADC-7 were used. The amplification products were purified and cloned into PCR 2.1-TOPO vector and transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli TOP10. These amplicons were then sequenced. PFGE was performed on DNA of A. baumannii isolates digested with ApaI. Results. The DNA profiles obtained included 9 clusters with, four 2-7 isolates per profile, and 5 single-isolate profiles. Of the 20 isolates resistant to imipenem, 15 carried bla OXA-23 gene, 4 contained ISAba1 upstream of bla OXA-51 gene, and 6 contained ISAba1 upstream of bla OXA-23 gene. Eighteen of these isolates carried the bla ADC-7 gene, with 9 of the isolates having ISAba1 located upstream of this gene. This is the first report of the ISAba1\/ADC-7 associated with OXAs genes in A. baumannii isolates from Colombia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56a768e22a83eeb12a8b4a74","authors":["Mart\u00ednez, Pedro","Mattar, Salim"],"doi":"10.1590\/s1517-83822012000400006","first_seen_on":"2013-05-28T21:13:31+00:00","issns":["1517-8382"],"journal":"Brazilian Journal of Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1366145192,"links":["http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/scielo.php?pid=S1517-83822012000400006&script=sci_arttext"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/scielo.php?script=sci_pdf&pid=S1517-83822012000400006&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en","pmid":"24031953","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SBM","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii carrying the ISAba1-bla OXA-23, 51 and ISAba1-bla ADC-7 genes in Monteria, Colombia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/imipenemresistant-acinetobacter-baumannii-carrying-isaba1blaoxa23-51-isaba1blaadc7-genes-monteria-co"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4655094,"mean":5.6505438971925,"rank":3894633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4655094,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90581,"mean":7.3560220136896,"rank":75136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90581,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
