Recently, several reports showed that inducers of autophagy attenuate cellular toxicities in Parkinson's disease models. In this report we screened HEK293 cells that stably express GFP-LC3, a marker of autophagy, for autophagy inducers and identified amurensin G, a compound isolated from the wild grape (Vitis amurensis). Amurensin G treatment induced punctate cytoplasmic expression of GFP-LC3 and increased the expression level of endogenous LC3-II. Incubation of human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells with amurensin G attenuated the cellular toxicities of rotenone in a model of Parkinson's disease. Amurensin G inhibited rotenone-induced apoptosis and interfered with rotenone-induced G2\/M cell cycle arrest. In addition, knockdown of beclin1, a regulator of autophagy, abolished the effect of amurensin G. These data collectively indicate that amurensin G attenuates cellular toxicities through the induction of autophagy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Ryu H","Oh WK","Jang IS","Park J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2013.02.053","first_seen_on":"2013-05-28T00:35:16+00:00","issns":["0006-291X","0006291X"],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1369701312,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006291X13003136"],"pmid":"23485458","pubdate":"2013-03-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Amurensin G induces autophagy and attenuates cellular toxicities in a rotenone model of Parkinson\u2019s disease ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/amurensin-g-induces-autophagy-attenuates-cellular-toxicities-rotenone-model-parkinsons-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2124254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2228870,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89803,"mean":7.1588157947486,"rank":40923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":45396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89803,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7473,"mean":2.1372085117773,"rank":4469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":2924,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7473,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":2.1355076923077,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
