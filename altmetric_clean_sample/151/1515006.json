Apart from the need for rapid anticonvulsive treatment, the underlying condition is often not immediately obvious. In the search for the correct diagnosis, a thorough history, clinical examination, laboratory work-up, neurophysiological and neuroradiological investigations are all essential. A close collaboration between neonatologists, neuropaediatricians, laboratory specialists, neurophysiologists and radiologists facilitates the adequate care of the infant.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088f5","authors":["Hallberg B","Blennow M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.siny.2013.03.001","first_seen_on":"2013-05-28T14:30:42+00:00","issns":["1744-165X","1744165X"],"journal":"Seminars in Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1369851222,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1744165X13000206"],"pmid":"23680099","pubdate":"2013-05-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["perinatology","pediatrics"],"title":"Investigations for neonatal seizures ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/investigations-neonatal-seizures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634915,"mean":4.919334042571,"rank":2740740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":736274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634915,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85721,"mean":6.940295706953,"rank":62661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":18221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85721,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":2.5751313131313,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":4.15,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
