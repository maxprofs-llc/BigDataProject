Considerable research has been conducted and a multitude of studies have documented support for empirically supported treatments (ESTs). However, the literature on implementing ESTs in real-world settings is relatively limited. The absence of practical guidance poses a particular problem for students in clinical psychology training programs that emphasize training and competency in ESTs. This article describes the development of an alcohol specialty clinic within a clinical psychology training program from the first conceptualizations to establishment of a referral base and provision of services. At each step, integration of science and clinical practice is discussed. Future directions and suggestions for developing training clinics are provided.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a7","doi":"10.1037\/a0030699","first_seen_on":"2013-05-27T10:13:46+00:00","issns":["0735-7028 (Print)"],"journal":"Professional Psychology, Research and Practice","last_mentioned_on":1369648800,"links":["http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/journals\/pro\/44\/2\/65\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/journals\/pro\/44\/2\/65.pdf","pmid":"23704805","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Psychological Association","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"A guide for starting a specialty training clinic: An alcohol treatment program as an example.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/guide-starting-specialty-training-clinic-alcohol-treatment-program-example"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.112,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.112},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685046,"mean":4.9228975163162,"rank":587930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3096177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685046,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85963,"mean":6.9277790419022,"rank":16733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":69203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85963,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":2.9294093959732,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
