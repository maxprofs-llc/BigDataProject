It can be functionally and cosmetically debilitating to many patients. A direct approach to the control of scar tissue formation is pharmacological regulation of collagen synthesis and deposition. Some studies reported that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) plays an important role in scar formation. Hepatocyte growth factor can improve tissue fibrosis and reverse the imbalance of collagen metabolism. However, an in vivo study has not been reported concerning the use of HGF in controlling hypertrophy of skin scar until now.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056d4","doi":"10.1097\/01.asw.0000429705.02588.f5","first_seen_on":"2013-05-28T18:00:56+00:00","issns":["1527-7941"],"issue":"6","journal":"Advances in skin & wound care (Print)","last_mentioned_on":1369764031,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aswcjournal\/Abstract\/2013\/06000\/Hepatocyte_Growth_Factor_Reduces_Hypertrophy_of.8.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/aswcjournal\/2013\/06000\/Hepatocyte_Growth_Factor_Reduces_Hypertrophy_of.8.pdf","pmid":"23685527","pubdate":"2013-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"266","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Hepatocyte Growth Factor Reduces Hypertrophy of Skin Scar: In Vivo Study","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hepatocyte-growth-factor-reduces-hypertrophy-skin-scar-vivo-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505402,"mean":5.1012628106873,"rank":3158599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1021241,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505402,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89796,"mean":7.092707812239,"rank":63378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":19039,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89796,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":536,"mean":1.5986803738318,"rank":430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":536,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.3068965517241,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ASWConline\/statuses\/339441066841362432","license":"public","citation_ids":[1515507],"posted_on":"2013-05-28T18:00:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Skin & Wound Care","url":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aswcjournal\/pages\/default.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3564333078\/5d46c97449088033f064d2113a40d5d7_normal.jpeg","description":"Advances in Skin & Wound Care has cutting-edge original research & practical clinical management articles on wounds & other problems of skin integrity.","id_on_source":"ASWConline","tweeter_id":"186510623","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2427},"tweet_id":"339441066841362432"}]}}
