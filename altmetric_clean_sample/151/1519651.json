The authors report the case of a 49-year-old woman who presented with a persistent cough subsequent to cervical spinal surgery. One year after the initial operation, the patient underwent surgery to free the larynx from the prevertebral fascia and cut the pharyngeal plexus, but her symptoms persisted. In order to control the cough, she used a soft cervical collar with padding inserted in the left side so that the larynx would be pushed to the right, a solution she discovered on her own. Without the collar, she coughed uncontrollably. A CT scan was performed and showed an osteophyte that had developed at the level of the prosthesis. Based on these findings, the authors hypothesized that the cough was caused by vagus nerve irritation due to the osteophyte. The osteophyte was resected and the vagus nerve was moved to a position anterior to the carotid artery and was isolated by means of an autogenous tensor fascia lata graft. The patient's symptom disappeared immediately after the surgery. At the most recent follow-up visit, 18 months after surgery, the patient was symptom free and was pursuing regular daily activities without using a cervical collar.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d9a","authors":["Orhan KS","Acar S","Ulusan M","Aydoseli A","G\u00fcldiken Y"],"doi":"10.3171\/2013.4.spine12428","first_seen_on":"2013-05-30T07:40:49+00:00","issns":["1547-5654"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine","last_mentioned_on":1369946385,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23705627\/?i=5&from=fascia"],"pmid":"23705627","pubdate":"2013-05-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"Persistent cough associated with osteophyte formation and vagus nerve impingement following cervical spinal surgery.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/persistent-cough-associated-osteophyte-formation-vagus-nerve-impingement-following-cervical-spinal-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4724786,"mean":5.6962574610309,"rank":2041846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2618363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4724786,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91779,"mean":7.3174767373445,"rank":34950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":55384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91779,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":525,"mean":3.3827977099237,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":525,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":2.545652173913,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
