Whilst numerous pathogens have been discovered in bat species, infection with lyssaviruses is of particular significance from a zoonotic perspective as, where human infection has been reported, it is invariably fatal. Here we review the detection of lyssaviruses within different bat species and overview what is understood regarding their maintenance and transmission following both experimental and natural infection. We discuss the relevance of these pathogens as zoonotic agents and the threat of newly discovered viruses to human populations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53b3cf058f610004704","authors":["Ashley Banyard"],"doi":"10.3390\/v6082974","first_seen_on":"2014-08-29T12:13:13+00:00","issns":["1999-4915",""],"issue":"8","journal":"Viruses (1999-4915)","last_mentioned_on":1429534897,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1999-4915\/6\/8\/2974","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3390\/v6082974"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1999-4915\/6\/8\/2974\/pdf","pmid":"25093425","pubdate":"2014-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Lyssaviruses and Bats: Emergence and Zoonotic Threat","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lyssaviruses-bats-emergence-zoonotic-threat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6793910,"mean":6.1766762619266,"rank":1462592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5304997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6793910,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179843,"mean":7.3905797867019,"rank":42543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":136599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179843,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1035,"mean":3.2784758220503,"rank":245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1035,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.3756666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
