Among the agents explored in clinical trials are anti-A\u03b2 peptide antibodies and secretase inhibitors. Most anti-A\u03b2 antibodies are considered to act via inhibition of amyloidosis and enhanced clearance of existing amyloid, although secretase inhibitors reduce the de novo production of A\u03b2. Limited information is currently available on the efficacy and potential advantages of combinatorial antiamyloid treatment. We performed a chronic study in APPLondon transgenic mice that received treatment with anti-A\u03b2 antibody gantenerumab and BACE inhibitor RO5508887, either as mono- or combination treatment. Treatment aimed to evaluate efficacy on amyloid progression, similar to preexisting amyloidosis as present in Alzheimer's disease patients. Mono-treatments with either compound caused a dose-dependent reduction of total brain A\u03b2 and amyloid burden. Combination treatment with both compounds significantly enhanced the antiamyloid effect. The observed combination effect was most pronounced for lowering of amyloid plaque load and plaque number, which suggests effective inhibition of de novo plaque formation. Moreover, significantly enhanced clearance of pre-existing amyloid plaques was observed when gantenerumab was coadministered with RO5508887. BACE inhibition led to a significant time- and dose-dependent decrease in CSF A\u03b2, which was not observed for gantenerumab treatment. Our results demonstrate that combining these two antiamyloid agents enhances overall efficacy and suggests that combination treatments may be of clinical relevance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Helmut Jacobsen","Laurence Ozmen","Antonello Caruso","Robert Narquizian","Hans Hilpert","Bjoern Jacobsen","Dick Terwel","An Tanghe","Bernd Bohrmann"],"doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.1405-14.2014","first_seen_on":"2014-08-29T10:11:31+00:00","issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"35","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1495537200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25164658?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/34\/35\/11621.short","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25164658"],"pmid":"25164658","pubdate":"2014-08-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Combined Treatment with a BACE Inhibitor and Anti-A\u03b2 Antibody Gantenerumab Enhances Amyloid Reduction in APPLondon Mice.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combined-treatment-bace-inhibitor-antia%CE%B2-antibody-gantenerumab-enhances-amyloid-reduction-applondon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17.248,"score_history":{"1y":7.248,"6m":7.248,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17.248},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":495828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7759295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186562,"mean":7.7852934107345,"rank":13832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":172730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186562,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12449,"mean":10.03856651671,"rank":1448,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":11001,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12449,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":333,"mean":11.402993975904,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":333,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
