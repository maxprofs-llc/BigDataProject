MF animals develop behavioral and endocrine changes that permit glucose tolerance despite increased meal size. We hypothesized that enhanced activity of the entero-insular axis mediates glucose homeostasis during MF. Cohorts of rats were allocated to MF or ad-libitum (AL) regimens for 2-4 weeks. Insulin secretion and glucose tolerance were determined after oral carbohydrate, and intraperitoneal (IP) and intravenous (IV) glucose. MF rats ate less than AL in the first week, but maintained a comparable weight trajectory thereafter. MF rats had decreased glucose excursions after a liquid mixed meal (AUC: MF 75 \u00b1 7, AL 461 \u00b1 28 mmol\/L\u2022min, p < 0.001), with left-shifted insulin secretion (AUC0-15: MF 31.0 \u00b1 4.9, AL 9.6 \u00b1 4.4 pM\u2022min; p < 0.02), that peaked before a significant rise in blood glucose. MF animals also had lower postprandial glucagon levels. However, neither intestinal expression of proGIP and proglucagon mRNA nor plasma incretin levels differed between MF and AL groups. There were no differences in the insulin response to IP or IV glucose between MF and AL rats. These findings demonstrate that MF improves oral glucose tolerance, and is associated with significant changes in postprandial islet hormone secretion. Because MF enhanced \u03b2-cell function during oral but not parenteral carbohydrate administration, and was not accounted for by changes in circulating incretins, these results support a neural mechanism of adaptive insulin secretion.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000220e","authors":["Torsten P Vahl","Benedikt A Aulinger","Eric P.
