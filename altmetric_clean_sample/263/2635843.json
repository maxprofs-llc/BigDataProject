It is an immune-mediated syndrome which presents with a variety of neurological symptoms including headache, fever, personality change and seizures. Most case reports to date are of young adults, it is much less frequently reported in older adults. The syndrome has been associated with ovarian teratomas. The prognosis is good with early recognition and treatment, though may relapse. We present a case of NMDA encephalitis in an elderly patient who responded well to immunosuppressive therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f6100021a6","authors":["K.
