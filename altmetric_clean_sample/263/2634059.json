To develop effective strategies to control extreme events is of fundamental importance and practical interest. Utilizing transportation dynamics on complex networks as a prototypical setting, we find that making the network \"mobile\" can effectively suppress extreme events. A striking, resonance-like phenomenon is uncovered, where an optimal degree of mobility exists for which the probability of extreme events is minimized. We derive an analytic theory to understand the mechanism of control at a detailed and quantitative level, and validate the theory numerically. Implications of our finding to current areas such as cybersecurity are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Yu-Zhong Chen","Zi-Gang Huang","Ying-Cheng Lai"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep06121","first_seen_on":"2014-08-28T13:47:18+00:00","issns":["xxxx-xxxx","2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1409913748,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2014\/140818\/srep06121\/full\/srep06121.html"],"pmid":"25131344","pubdate":"2014-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complex networks","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Nonlinear phenomena","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Controlling extreme events on complex networks","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/controlling-extreme-events-complex-networks"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6235825,"mean":5.9758946997244,"rank":421981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":5812093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6235825,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141571,"mean":8.4523749523205,"rank":14204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":127300,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141571,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21975,"mean":13.903904250478,"rank":3108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":18857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21975,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":563,"mean":13.959946619217,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":563,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":11,"researcher":4,"science_communicator":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":3,"Members of the public":11,"Scientists":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
