The only DNA polymerase (Pol) that is known to replicate efficiently across CPDs is Pol\u03b7, a member of the Y family of translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases. Phenotypes of Pol\u03b7 deficiency are transient, suggesting redundancy with other DNA damage tolerance pathways. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of the temporal requirements of Y-family Pols \u03b9 and \u03ba as backups for Pol\u03b7 in (i) bypassing genomic CPD and (6-4)PP lesions in vivo, (ii) suppressing DNA damage signaling, (iii) maintaining cell cycle progression and (iv) promoting cell survival, by using mouse embryonic fibroblast lines with single and combined disruptions in these Pols. The contribution of Pol\u03b9 is restricted to TLS at a subset of the photolesions. Pol\u03ba plays a dominant role in rescuing stalled replication forks in Pol\u03b7-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, both at CPDs and (6-4)PPs. This dampens DNA damage signaling and cell cycle arrest, and results in increased survival. The role of relatively error-prone Pols \u03b9 and \u03ba as backups for Pol\u03b7 contributes to the understanding of the mutator phenotype of xeroderma pigmentosum variant, a syndrome caused by Pol\u03b7 defects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["Jacob G.
