A cDNA clone isolated in this study was shown to contain the 3' end of a previously uncharacterized human MyoHC gene which is expressed specifically in human fast IIA muscle fibres and we conclude that this clone contains part of the human fast IIA MyoHC gene. In all the fibres histochemically, immunohistochemically and electrophoretically characterized as containing the previously classified IIB MyoHC (n = 23), it was shown that the human equivalent to the rat type IIX MyoHC gene is expressed. This observation was taken to suggest that the previously classified IIB muscles fibres in human muscle express a MyoHC isoform equivalent to the rat IIX, not the IIB, and would therefore be more accurately classified as IIX fibres.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d77","authors":["S Ennion","J Sant'ana Pereira","A J Sargeant","A Young","G Goldspink"],"first_seen_on":"2014-08-29T00:06:32+00:00","issns":["0142-4319"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility","last_mentioned_on":1409207910,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7751403"],"pmid":"7751403","pubdate":"1995-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","physiology"],"title":"Characterization of human skeletal muscle fibres according to the myosin heavy chains they express.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-human-skeletal-muscle-fibres-according-myosin-heavy-chains-express-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4189928,"mean":5.1226511927222,"rank":813352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3348503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4189928,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108245,"mean":8.1726480913492,"rank":25852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":81982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108245,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103,"mean":2.3151960784314,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"googleplus":[{"title":"Anthony J Sargeant and colleagues examined the presence of RNA transcripts for isoforms of the myosin...","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/113974603200505507716\/posts\/TNjWvKGHZou","citation_ids":[2636052],"posted_on":"2014-08-28T06:38:30+00:00","summary":"Anthony J Sargeant and colleagues examined the presence of RNA transcripts for isoforms of the myosin...
