A recent report showed that PGAP5, a human homologue of CDC1, acts as a phosphodiesterase removing an ethanolaminephosphate from mannose 2 of the GPI anchor, thus permitting efficient ER to Golgi transport of GPI proteins. We find that the essential CDC1 gene can be deleted in mcd4\u2206 cells, which do not attach ethanolaminephosphate to mannose 1 of the GPI anchor, suggesting that Cdc1 removes the ethanolaminephosphate added by Mcd4. Cdc1-314(ts) mutants do not accumulate GPI proteins in the ER but have a partial secretion block later in the secretory pathway. Growth tests and the genetic interaction profile of cdc1-314(ts) pinpoint a distinct cell wall defect. Osmotic support restores GPI-protein secretion and actin polarization but not growth. Cell walls of cdc1-314(ts) mutants contain large amounts of GPI proteins that are easily released by \u03b2-glucanases, not attached to cell wall \u03b21,6-glucans and retain their original GPI anchor lipid. This suggests that the presumed transglycosidases Dfg5 and Dcw1 of cdc1-314(ts) transfer GPI-proteins to cell wall \u03b21,6-glucans inefficiently.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c7","authors":["Hector M Vazquez","Christine Vionnet","Carole Roubaty","Andreas Conzelmann"],"doi":"10.1091\/mbc.e14-06-1033","first_seen_on":"2014-08-29T12:56:31+00:00","issns":["1939-4586"],"journal":"Molecular Biology of the Cell","last_mentioned_on":1409316949,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25165136?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25165136","pubdate":"2014-08-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Cdc1 removes the ethanolaminephosphate of the first mannose of GPI anchors and thereby facilitates the integration of GPI proteins into the yeast cell wall.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cdc1-removes-ethanolamine-phosphate-first-mannose-gpi-anchors-thereby-facilitates-integration-gpi-pr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4193102,"mean":5.1241378067285,"rank":3347560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":115192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4193102,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108325,"mean":8.1788381152838,"rank":86420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108325,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2005,"mean":2.5288453093812,"rank":1611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2005,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":2.1576271186441,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
