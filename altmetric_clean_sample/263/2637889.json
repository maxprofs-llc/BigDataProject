The current study was designed to examine harmful alcohol use as a dyadic and interactive time-varying risk factor for psychological and physical IPV across the transition to parenthood using a sample of 98 couples assessed prenatally and again at one and two years postpartum. Longitudinal actor-partner interdependence models demonstrated that changes in harmful alcohol use during the transition to parenthood were significantly related to changes in psychological IPV for both men and women and with physical IPV for men only, whereas harmful alcohol use was actually negatively related to variations in women's physical IPV. Partners' harmful use of alcohol during the transition to parenthood also explained additional variance in psychological IPV for men and physical IPV for women over time. Time-varying interactions between actors' and partners' harmful alcohol use were additionally predictive of greater psychological IPV for women and greater physical IPV for both men and women. Contrary to some past research, time-varying discrepancies in levels of harmful alcohol use between men and women were related to a lower risk of psychological IPV for women and physical IPV for both genders. Findings from this study indicate that harmful alcohol use by both men and women combines in a dyadic and interactive manner to place couples at risk for IPV during the transition to parenthood. Prenatal interventions may benefit from strategies to reduce the harmful use of alcohol by both men and women during the prenatal and postpartum periods.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002176","authors":["Woodin EM","Caldeira V","Sotskova A","Galaugher T","Lu M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.addbeh.2014.07.033","first_seen_on":"2014-08-29T12:56:42+00:00","issns":["03064603"],"issue":"12","journal":"Addictive Behaviors","last_mentioned_on":1446067730,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25150656","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0306460314002640&_version=1&md5=5a4238fa168c6d7210db49e0a77d5f2b"],"pmid":"25150656","pubdate":"2014-08-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Harmful alcohol use as a predictor of intimate partner violence during the transition to parenthood: Interdependent and interactive effects ","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/harmful-alcohol-predictor-intimate-partner-violence-during-transition-parenthood-interdependent-inte"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6500718,"mean":6.0222432796255,"rank":815629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":5683193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6500718,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155679,"mean":8.137258893357,"rank":24932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":130675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155679,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1415,"mean":5.4596888260255,"rank":187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":1228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1415,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":20.055523809524,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":10,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":10,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
