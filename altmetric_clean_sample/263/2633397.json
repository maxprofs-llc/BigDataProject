Very often, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and metabolic syndrome (MS) coexist with resistant hypertension (RHTN) and may lead to diastolic dysfunction. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether OSA and MS are associated with diastolic dysfunction in patients with RHTN independently from other factors, including age, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), and blood pressure (BP).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f61000697a","authors":["Piotr Dobrowolski","Anna Klisiewicz","Aleksander Prejbisz","El\u017cbieta Florczak","Justyna Rybicka","Przemys\u0142aw Biele\u0144","Pawe\u0142 \u015aliwi\u0144ski","Maria Gosk","Andrzej Januszewicz,","Piotr Hoffman"],"doi":"10.1093\/ajh\/hpu150","first_seen_on":"2014-08-28T12:40:43+00:00","issns":["1941-7225"],"journal":"American Journal of Hypertension (Science Direct)","last_mentioned_on":1409198967,"links":["http:\/\/ajh.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2014\/08\/25\/ajh.hpu150.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajh.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2014\/08\/25\/ajh.hpu150.full.pdf","pmid":"25159084","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Factors Associated With Diastolic Dysfunction in Patients With Resistant Hypertension: Resist-POL Study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factors-associated-diastolic-dysfunction-patients-resistant-hypertension-resistpol-study-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4189928,"mean":5.1226511927222,"rank":3345032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":115298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4189928,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108585,"mean":8.1810195240551,"rank":86574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108585,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":599,"mean":5.2993277591973,"rank":484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":599,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":10.352380952381,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Office_j\/status\/504843175106588673","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2633397],"posted_on":"2014-08-28T04:09:27+00:00","author":{"name":"\u5b87\u6d25\u8cb4\u53f2 [Utsu, Takashi]","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1251181299\/Office-j_normal.jpg","description":"\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u533b\u5b66\u30ea\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3002 \u7f72\u540d\u3001\u7121\u7f72\u540d\u3067\u3001\u533b\u5bb6\u5411\u3051\u3084\u4e00\u822c\u5411\u3051\u5a92\u4f53\u306b\u66f8\u304b\u305b\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u3044\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u3053\u3067\u306f\u65e5\u3005\u306e\u5099\u5fd8\u9332\u3068\u3057\u3066\u545f\u304d\u307e\u3059 \u3002\u539f\u7a3f\u306e\u3054\u76f8\u8ac7\u3082\u3069\u3046\u305e\u300a\u4f11\u65e5\u306fR325-58,-64\u3084Casino\u3001J160E\u3001Base VI\u5f3e\u304d\u3002Vox Continental [\u4e0d\u6240\u6301] \u306f\u8098\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30b5\u30f3\u30c9\uff09\u3002","id_on_source":"Office_j","tweeter_id":"249537501","geo":{"lt":35.6895,"ln":139.69171,"country":"JP"},"followers":1154},"tweet_id":"504843175106588673"}]}}
