We describe the working principles and analytical models for the \u03bc-gripper release and retrieval mechanisms, and evaluate the proposed biopsy method in ex vivo experiments. This hierarchical approach combining the advanced navigation skills of centimeter-scaled untethered magnetic capsule endoscopes with highly parallel, autonomous, submillimeter scale tissue sampling \u03bc-grippers offers a multifunctional strategy for gastrointestinal capsule biopsy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a47","authors":["Yim S","Gultepe E","Gracias D","Sitti M","Sehyuk Yim","Evin Gultepe","David H.
