This case highlights the clinically significant cardiac manifestation caused by protein misfolding, a defect in protein homeostasis. In addition, the utility of a relatively newer laboratory test, serum free light chains as well as the importance of clinical and pathophysiologic correlation is also discussed. We present a relatively uncommon cause of heart disease, cardiac amyloidosis in a patient with a systemic plasma cell dyscrasia, and multiple myeloma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Ha CE","Bhagavan NV","Loscalzo M","Chan SK","Nguyen HV","Rios CN","Honda SA"],"first_seen_on":"2014-08-28T15:10:46+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"6","journal":"Hawaii J Med Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1409347250,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24959390?utm_content=7579946&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24959390"],"pmcid":"PMC4064341","pmid":"24959390","pubdate":"2014-06-26T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["medicine","publichealth"],"title":"Congestive heart failure: a case of protein misfolding.","type":"article","volume":"73","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/congestive-heart-failure-case-protein-misfolding"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1,"GB":1,"US":1},"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jimanxxx\/status\/505007759402991616","license":"datasift","rt":["BindingSiteHaem"],"citation_ids":[2634630],"posted_on":"2014-08-28T15:03:27+00:00","author":{"name":"Jos\u00e9 L.
