Generally, altered neurological function is reflected in behavior. Although the molecular mechanism of action of PSPs is well known, its neurobehavioral effects on adult zebrafish and its relationship with altered neurological functions are poorly understood. Aphantoxins purified from a natural isolate of A. flos-aquae DC-1 were analyzed by HPLC. The major analogs found in the toxins were the gonyautoxins 1 and 5 (GTX1 and GTX5; 34.04% and 21.28%, respectively) and the neosaxitoxin (neoSTX, 12.77%). Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were intraperitoneally injected with 5.3 and 7.61 \u03bcg STXeq\/kg (low and high dose, respectively) of A. flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins. The swimming activity was investigated by observation combined with video at 6 timepoints from 1 to 24 h post-exposure. Both aphantoxin doses were associated with delayed touch responses, reduced head-tail locomotory abilities, inflexible turning of head, and a tailward-shifted center of gravity. The normal S-pattern (or undulating) locomotor trajectory was replaced by a mechanical motor pattern of swinging the head after wagging the tail. Finally, these fish principally distributed at the top and\/or bottom water of the aquarium, and showed a clear polarized distribution pattern at 12 h post-exposure. Further analysis of neurological function demonstrated that both aphantoxin doses inhibited brain acetylcholinesterase activity. All these changes were dose- and time-dependent. These results demonstrate that aphantoxins can alter locomotor capacity, touch responses and distribution patterns by damaging the cholinergic system of zebrafish, and suggest that zebrafish locomotor behavior and acetylcholinesterase can be used as indicators for investigating aphantoxins and blooms in nature.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022f3","authors":["Zhang DL","Hu CX","Li DH","Liu YD"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aquatox.2013.04.016","first_seen_on":"2014-08-29T21:12:01+00:00","issns":["0166-445X"],"issue":"","journal":"Aquatic Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1409346701,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23792258"],"pmid":"23792258","pubdate":"2013-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Zebrafish locomotor capacity and brain acetylcholinesterase activity is altered by Aphanizomenon flos-aquae DC-1 aphantoxins.","type":"article","volume":"138-139C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zebrafish-locomotor-capacity-brain-acetylcholinesterase-activity-altered-aphanizomenon-flosaquae-dc1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4193102,"mean":5.1241378067285,"rank":3347560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":115192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4193102,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108326,"mean":8.1787649203785,"rank":86420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108326,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":394,"mean":2.9085038167939,"rank":292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":394,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.975,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
