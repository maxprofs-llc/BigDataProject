Despite its first discovery in the early 2000s, the role of this channel in prostate cancer (PCa) remained, until now, obscure. Here we show that TRPV6 mediates calcium entry, which is highly increased in PCa due to the remodeling mechanism involving the translocation of the TRPV6 channel to the plasma membrane via the Orai1\/TRPC1-mediated Ca(2+)\/Annexin I\/S100A11 pathway, partially contributing to SOCE. The TRPV6 calcium channel is expressed de novo by the PCa cell to increase its survival by enhancing proliferation and conferring apoptosis resistance. Xenografts in nude mice and bone metastasis models confirmed the remarkable aggressiveness of TRPV6-overexpressing tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis of these demonstrated the increased expression of clinical markers such as Ki-67, prostate specific antigen, synaptophysin, CD31, and CD56, which are strongly associated with a poor prognosis. Thus, the TRPV6 channel acquires its oncogenic potential in PCa due to the remodeling mechanism via the Orai1-mediated Ca(2+)\/Annexin I\/S100A11 pathway.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Maylis Rapha\u00ebl","V\u2019yacheslav Lehen\u2019kyi","Matthieu Vandenberghe","Benjamin Beck","Sergiy Khalimonchyk","Fabien Vanden Abeele","Leonardo Farsetti","Emmanuelle Germain","Alexandre Bokhobza","Adriana Mihalache","Pierre Gosset","Christoph Romanin","Philippe Cl\u00e9zardin","Roman Skryma","Natalia Prevarskaya"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1413409111","first_seen_on":"2014-08-29T22:30:32+00:00","issns":["1091-6490"],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1409346840,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2014\/08\/28\/1413409111"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2014\/08\/28\/1413409111.full.pdf","pmid":"25172921","pubdate":"2014-08-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"201413409","subjects":["science"],"title":"TRPV6 calcium channel translocates to the plasma membrane via Orai1-mediated mechanism and controls cancer cell survival","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trpv6-calcium-channel-translocates-plasma-membrane-via-orai1mediated-mechanism-controls-cancer-cell"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4193102,"mean":5.1241378067285,"rank":470752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":3712517,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4193102,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108325,"mean":8.1767593700381,"rank":15991,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":92152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108325,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36359,"mean":14.473242147533,"rank":9571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":26669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36359,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":907,"mean":38.32417218543,"rank":456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":907,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
