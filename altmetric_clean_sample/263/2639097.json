We previously demonstrated lower insulin secretion in minor allele carriers of PPARG Pro12Ala in high-NEFA environment, but the mode of action could not been revealed. We tested if this effect is mediated by FFAR1 in humans. Subjects with increased risk of diabetes who underwent oral glucose tolerance tests were genotyped for 7 tagging SNPs in FFAR1 and PPARG Pro12Ala. The FFAR1 SNPs rs12462800 and rs10422744 demonstrated interactions with PPARG on insulin secretion. FFAR1 rs12462800 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0006) and rs10422744 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) were associated with reduced insulin secretion in participants concomitantly carrying the PPARG minor allele and having high fasting FFA. These results suggest that the minor allele of the PPARG SNP exposes its carriers to modulatory effects of FFAR1 on insulin secretion. This subphenotype may define altered responsiveness to FFAR1-agonists, and should be investigated in further studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"537f30862a83eeb45a8b4630","authors":["Robert Wagner","Anja Hieronimus","Apostolia Lamprinou","Martin Heni","Erifili Hatziagelaki","Susanne Ullrich","Norbert Stefan","Harald Staiger","Hans-Ulrich H\u00e4ring","Andreas Fritsche"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.molmet.2014.07.001","first_seen_on":"2014-08-29T22:05:49+00:00","issns":["2212-8778","22128778"],"issue":"6","journal":"Molecular Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1414672988,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25161890?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/download.journals.elsevierhealth.com\/pdfs\/journals\/2212-8778\/PIIS2212877814001240.pdf"],"pmid":"25161890","pubdate":"2014-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","title":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) modulates free fatty acid receptor 1 (FFAR1) dependent insulin secretion in humans ","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/peroxisome-proliferatoractivated-receptor-gamma-pparg-modulates-free-fatty-acid-receptor-1-ffar1-dep"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5032959,"mean":5.9653559095836,"rank":2049799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2957369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5032959,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131539,"mean":8.4020403533584,"rank":46435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":84222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131539,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199,"mean":7.1241818181818,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.29375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
