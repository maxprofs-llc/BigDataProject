In this study, two constructs of a truncated form of SjTGR without the last two residues (Sec597-Gly598) were cloned, overexpressed and purified using wild-type and codon-optimized genes. Only SjTGR from the wild-type gene was found to form a complex with flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which could be crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 84.185, b = 86.47, c = 183.164\u2005\u00c5, at 295\u2005K using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. One dimer was present in the crystallographic asymmetric unit and the calculated Matthews coefficient (VM) and solvent content were 2.6\u2005\u00c5(3)\u2005Da(-1) and 52.8%, respectively. Structural determination of SjTGR is in progress using the molecular-replacement method.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Li Y","Wu Q","Peng Y","Huang F","Li X","Chen L","Shi D","Zhou X","Fan X"],"doi":"10.1107\/s2053230x1303313x","first_seen_on":"2014-08-28T11:53:25+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"Pt 1","journal":"Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun","last_mentioned_on":1409209752,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24419626?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24419626","pubdate":"2014-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","title":"Expression, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of thioredoxin glutathione reductase from Schistosoma japonicum in complex with FAD.","type":"article","volume":"70","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-crystallization-preliminary-xray-diffraction-analysis-thioredoxin-glutathione-reductase-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4759378,"mean":5.7095406108846,"rank":2526817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1585800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4759378,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122573,"mean":8.4559447345235,"rank":62658,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":45070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122573,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.25,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":3622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":317,"mean":2.2173291139241,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":317,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
