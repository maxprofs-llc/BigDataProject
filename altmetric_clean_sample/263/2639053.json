The decarboxylative C-O bond forming reaction proceeded in the presence of PhI(OAc)2 to give the corresponding allylic acetates. In addition, decarboxylative C-N bond formation was achieved by utilizing hypervalent iodine(III) reagents containing an I-N bond. Mechanistic studies suggest the unique reactivity of hypervalent iodine reagents in this ionic oxidative decarboxylation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Kensuke Kiyokawa","Shunsuke Yahata","Takumi Kojima","Satoshi Minakata"],"doi":"10.1021\/ol5022433","first_seen_on":"2014-08-29T22:00:53+00:00","issns":["1523-7060","1523-7052"],"journal":"Organic Letters","last_mentioned_on":1409204013,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ol5022433"],"pmid":"25162482","pubdate":"2014-08-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"140827093848006","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Hypervalent Iodine(III)-Mediated Oxidative Decarboxylation of \u03b2,\u03b3-Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypervalent-iodineiiimediated-oxidative-decarboxylation-%CE%B2keto-acids"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4825071,"mean":5.7596596592422,"rank":2224317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2478967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4825071,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123782,"mean":8.449187726711,"rank":51870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":67690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123782,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3067,"mean":3.239161121983,"rank":1479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3067,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":2.3888529411765,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
