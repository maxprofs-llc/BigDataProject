There is little published information to guide the surgeon regarding the appropriate approach to treating a chondroblastoma in this location. We developed a modified trapdoor procedure to address this issue. The primary modification is that the window surface of the femoral head is covered by the ligamentum teres rather than cartilage as in the traditional procedure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000256d","authors":["Hairong Xu","Xiaohui Niu","Yuan Li","Odion T.
