The absolute configuration of each enantiomer is determined by comparing the experimental and theoretical spectra. The result is in accord with the results of the X-ray single crystallographic analysis on the enantiomeric crystal. Moreover, the importance of the CH-\u03c0 interaction is derived between phen and a hydrogen atom in bzq in the molecular packing of both the enantiomeric and racemic crystals. A helical column is formed in the enantiomeric crystal in the tetragonal space group P43, whereas a tight racemic pair is formed in the racemic crystal in the monoclinic space group P21\/n.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":[" Kazuyoshi Takimoto","Yutaka Watanabe","Shigeki Mori","Hisako Sato"],"doi":"10.1039\/c7dt00606c","first_seen_on":"2017-03-03T09:51:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9226","1477-9234"],"journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1488534693,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2017\/DT\/C7DT00606C?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2017\/dt\/c7dt00606c","pmid":"28290589","pubdate":"2017-03-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Vibrational Circular Dichroism and Single Crystal X-Ray Diffraction Analyses of [Ir(bzq)2(phen)]+ (bzq = benzo[h]quinoline; phen = 1,10-phenanthroline): Absolute Configuration and Role of CH-\u03c0 Interaction in Molecular Packing","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":7178650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241718,"mean":13.728364078653,"rank":201203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241718,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11269,"mean":0.70261466098687,"rank":3221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11269,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":473,"mean":1.3018008474576,"rank":164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":473,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/837601329019158528","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16950569],"posted_on":"2017-03-03T09:51:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"837601329019158528"}]}}
