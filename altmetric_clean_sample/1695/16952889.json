These strains produce bright yellow colonies and have a filamentous morphology and an optimum growth temperature of about 60 degrees C. Lipid composition and 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analyses showed that these strains belong to the genus Thermonema, a member of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides phylum. Growth was observed in medium containing 1 to 3% NaCl. The DNA G + C content was 50.9 mol%. DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed that these strains represent a new species of the genus Thermonema. We propose that strain NR-27T (T = type strain) and the other strains represent a new species, Thermonema rossianum. Strain NR-27 (= DSM 10300) is the type strain of this species.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fc","authors":["SANDRA TENREIRO","M. FERNANDA NOBRE","FRED A. RAINEY","CARLA MIGUEL","MILTON S.
