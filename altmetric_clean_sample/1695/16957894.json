This approach does not mimic species-specific mechanisms occurring in human diseases and may preclude successful clinical translation. We have developed a protocol to engineer humanized bone within immunodeficient hosts, which can be adapted to study the interactions between human cancer cells and a humanized bone microenvironment in vivo. A researcher trained in the principles of tissue engineering will be able to execute the protocol and yield study results within 4-6 months. Additive biomanufactured scaffolds seeded and cultured with human bone-forming cells are implanted ectopically in combination with osteogenic factors into mice to generate a physiological bone 'organ', which is partially humanized. The model comprises human bone cells and secreted extracellular matrix (ECM); however, other components of the engineered tissue, such as the vasculature, are of murine origin. The model can be further humanized through the engraftment of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that can lead to human hematopoiesis within the murine host. The humanized organ bone model has been well characterized and validated and allows dissection of some of the mechanisms of the bone metastatic processes in prostate and breast cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000825c","authors":["Laure C Martine","Boris M Holzapfel","Jacqui A McGovern","Ferdinand Wagner","Verena M Quent","Parisa Hesami","Felix M Wunner","Cedryck Vaquette","Elena M De-Juan-Pardo","Toby D Brown","Bianca Nowlan","Dan Jing Wu","Cosmo Orlando Hutmacher","Davide Moi","Tatiana Oussenko","Elia Piccinini","Peter W Zandstra","Roberta Mazzieri","Jean-Pierre L\u00e9vesque","Paul D Dalton","Anna V Taubenberger","Dietmar W Hutmacher"],"doi":"10.1038\/nprot.2017.002","endpage":"663","first_seen_on":"2017-03-03T15:55:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1754-2189","1750-2799"],"issue":"4","journal":"Nature Protocols","last_mentioned_on":1489102579,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nprot\/journal\/v12\/n4\/full\/nprot.2017.002.html?WT.feed_name=subjects_cancer","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nprot\/journal\/v12\/n4\/full\/nprot.2017.002.html?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureProtocols","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nprot\/journal\/v12\/n4\/full\/nprot.2017.002.html"],"pmid":"28253234","pubdate":"2017-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Research","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mouse","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Tissue engineering","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Cancer models","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Bone metastases","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"639","subjects":["science","clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Engineering a humanized bone organ model in mice to study bone metastases","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nprot.2017.002","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/engineering-humanized-bone-organ-model-mice-study-bone-metastases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":3.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":1978767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6314655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242273,"mean":13.742513167018,"rank":80604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":160923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242273,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1245,"mean":9.1806028938907,"rank":601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1245,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":25.205842105263,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
