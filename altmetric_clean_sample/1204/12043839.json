Both structures are compared with four similar ones from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), and the interactions involved in the stabilization are analyzed using the atoms in molecules (AIM) theory. Finally, a single-crystal in-situ reaction study is presented, carried out by fluorescence methods, which enabled the `opening' of the spirolactam ring in the solid phase.","altmetric_jid":"57da952eaee83e3eee8b4569","authors":["Di Paolo, M.","Di Paolo, M.","Bossi, M.L.","Baggio, R.","Suarez, S.A."],"doi":"10.1107\/s2052520616009343","first_seen_on":"2016-09-17T00:00:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2052-5206"],"issue":"5","journal":"ACTA CRYSTALLOGRAPHICA SECTION B","last_mentioned_on":1474070405,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S2052520616009343"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/b\/issues\/2016\/05\/00\/eb5049\/eb5049.pdf","pmid":"27698308","pubdate":"2016-09-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","title":"Two rhodamine 6G derivative compounds: a structural and fluorescence single-crystal study","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/two-rhodamine-6g-derivative-compounds-structural-fluorescence-singlecrystal-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":6366809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1137789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253997,"mean":12.651113230129,"rank":179064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":43594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253997,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":430,"mean":2.2991375291375,"rank":142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":430,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":3.134375,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
