There is a shorter 20-item version (PSI-20) with excellent psychomotor properties for screening.\nTo study the convergent and divergent validity of the PSI and PSI-20, by analysing how their scales reflect the day-to-day consequences of real deficits found in neurological assessment performed by means of performance tests.\nA sample of 52 persons undergoing treatment for substance addiction (31 males and 21 females) were administered the PSI together with an abbreviated neuropsychological examination battery focused on describing attentional, mnemonic and executive processes.\nBoth versions of the PSI present optimal psychometric properties (0.78 > alpha > 0.94 for the complete 46-item version and 0.7 > alpha > 0.89 for the abbreviated 20-item version). The results confirm the hypotheses regarding their validity: the performance problems scale is related with the capacity to resolve tests that supposedly rate the executive functions of a prefrontal origin (convergent validity), whereas the scales of problems in emotional control and problems with social behaviour are not related with those cognitive capabilities (discriminant validity).\nThe PSI is a test that is clinically useful, psychometrically valid and applicable in multiple clinical populations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90e3cf058f61000cbca","authors":["Pedrero-Perez, E J","Ruiz-Sanchez de Leon, J M","Rojo-Mota, G","Morales-Alonso, S","Pedrero-Aguilar, J","Lorenzo, I","Gonzalez, A"],"first_seen_on":"2016-09-17T00:24:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1576-6578"],"issue":"6","journal":"Revista de neurologia","last_mentioned_on":1474071884,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27600738?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27600738","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"[Prefrontal Symptoms Inventory (PSI): ecological validity and convergence with neuropsychological measures].","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prefrontal-symptoms-inventory-psi-ecological-validity-convergence-neuropsychological-measures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":7254313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254025,"mean":12.651989174251,"rank":210464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254025,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":577,"mean":1.7698402777778,"rank":458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":577,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.80555555555556,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Social Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rocatanho\/statuses\/776939910058082305","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12044186],"posted_on":"2016-09-17T00:24:44+00:00","author":{"name":"rodolfo catanho","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/418701421031088129\/F1CIU3nb_normal.jpeg","description":"internist.  proudly friend of my friends.
