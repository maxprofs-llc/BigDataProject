To identify the risk factors for recurrence, we analyzed age, gender, multiplicity, size, number, extrathyroidal extension (ETE) of the tumor, lymph node metastasis (LNM), type of surgery, and the dose of radioactive ablation using a Cox regression model to identify hazard ratios (HRs).\nAmong the 115 asymptomatic patients with PTCs detected by screening ultrasonography (n=86), other cross-sectional imaging modalities (computed tomography or positron emission tomography-computed tomography, n=13), or incidentally through a surgical specimen (n=16), 78 patients were confirmed to have papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PTMCs). The other 35 symptomatic patients with PTCs had significantly larger tumors (3.0\u00b11.9 cm). During the follow-up period (mean, 43.6 months), 17 patients (12.5%) experienced recurrence in the neck. None of the patients died due to PTC-related recurrence or distant metastasis during the follow-up period. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that tumor size (HR, 2.12; P<0.001) and LNM (central LNM: HR, 9.08; P=0.004; lateral LNM: HR, 14.71; P=0.002; both central and lateral LNM: HR, 58.41; P<0.001) significantly increased the recurrence rate. ETE, LNM, and recurrence were significantly less frequent in PTMCs than in non-PTMC (all P<0.001).\nPTCs of small size and absent LNM showed significantly better prognoses in patients 65 years and older.","altmetric_jid":"56b367f52a83eea9718b465a","authors":["Eun Sil Kim","Younghen Lee","Hyungsuk Seo","Gil Soo Son","Soon Young Kwon","Young-Sik Kim","Ji-A Seo","Nan Hee Kim","Sang-il Suh","Inseon Ryoo","Sung-Hye You"],"doi":"10.14366\/usg.17010","first_seen_on":"2017-05-18T16:15:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2288-5919","2288-5943"],"journal":"Ultrasonography","last_mentioned_on":1495124140,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28513128?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28513128","pubdate":"2017-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Clinical features of recently diagnosed papillary thyroid carcinoma in elderly patients based on 10-Year sonographic experience at a single institution in Korea","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":7116923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234026,"mean":12.37929431471,"rank":190334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234026,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":3.7712941176471,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":2.3333333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/865239471716917250","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20268702],"posted_on":"2017-05-18T16:15:40+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"865239471716917250"}]}}
