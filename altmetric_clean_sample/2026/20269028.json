Tl-201 images were processed for spill-over and scatter corrections, and uptake differences with stress Sestamibi SPECT were analyzed: (1) for rest acquisitions from Tl-201 (dual-isotope procedure) and from Sestamibi (single-isotope procedure) and (2) in segments for which a diagnosis of ischemia, infarct, or normal perfusion was achieved. Mean effective dose was 8.3\u00a0mSv for dual-isotope but would decrease to 5.7\u00a0mSv for an expected rate of 37% of patients for whom rest-SPECT is not warranted. After a further background correction of Tl-201 images, the rest-stress difference in myocardial uptake was equivalent between dual- and single-procedures for identifying ischemic segments (respective areas-under-curves: 0.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 and 0.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03).\nThis original dual-isotope procedure provides acceptable radiation doses and consistent results, as compared with conventional single-isotope.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da1","authors":["Imbert, Laetitia","Roch, V\u00e9ronique","Merlin, Charles","Djaballah, Wassila","Cachin, Florent","Perrin, Mathieu","Claudin, Marine","Verger, Antoine","Boutley, Henri","Karcher, Gilles","Marie, Pierre-Yves"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12350-017-0914-z","first_seen_on":"2017-05-18T16:34:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1071-3581","1532-6551"],"journal":"Journal of Nuclear Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1495173996,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28512723?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28512723","pubdate":"2017-05-18T22:04:29+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nuclear Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Low-dose dual-isotope procedure planed for myocardial perfusion CZT-SPECT and assessed through a head-to-head comparison with a conventional single-isotope protocol","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":6249250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1107808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234381,"mean":12.382285442444,"rank":165731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234381,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":788,"mean":3.243418043202,"rank":525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":788,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":10.380468085106,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/usmolecular\/statuses\/865244110776442880","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20269028],"posted_on":"2017-05-18T16:34:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1L7L","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/135034398\/atom_normal.bmp","description":"Molecular imaging and medicine tweets.","id_on_source":"usmolecular","tweeter_id":"30724493","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":24806},"tweet_id":"865244110776442880"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cardiacimaging\/statuses\/865448584073826306","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20269028],"posted_on":"2017-05-19T06:06:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Cardiac","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1GEa","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2406742261\/x3ds44aipz7rb9caz5p1_normal.jpeg","description":"Cardiovascular imaging and heart health.","id_on_source":"cardiacimaging","tweeter_id":"64524440","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":7862},"tweet_id":"865448584073826306"}]}}
