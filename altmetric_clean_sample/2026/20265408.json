Functionally diverse N(2)-substituted 1,2,3-triazoles were obtained in moderate to good yields through novel difunctionalization of vinyl azides by aryldiazonium salt sources. This method has a wide scope, good functional-group tolerance and insensitivity to an ambient atmosphere.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e2","authors":["Zhenhua Liu","Huimin Ji","Wen Gao","Guangyu Zhu","Lili Tong","Fengcai Lei","Bo Tang"],"doi":"10.1039\/c7cc02391j","first_seen_on":"2017-05-18T13:59:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1364-548X"],"journal":"Chemical Communications","last_mentioned_on":1495115972,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2017\/CC\/C7CC02391J?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2017\/cc\/c7cc02391j","pmid":"28541352","pubdate":"2017-05-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Copper(I)-Mediated Carboamination of Vinyl Azides by Aryldiazonium Salts: Synthesis of N2-substituted 1,2,3-Triazoles","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/copperimediated-carboamination-vinyl-azides-aryldiazonium-salts-synthesis-n2substituted-123triazoles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":4373686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2283030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234026,"mean":12.37930414272,"rank":129640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":82431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234026,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5906,"mean":3.0249581710415,"rank":2644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":2230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5906,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":309,"mean":3.879525974026,"rank":154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":309,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
