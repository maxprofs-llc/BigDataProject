Adverse events (AEs) were assessed using CTCAE v4.0 and tumor response was assessed using RECIST v1.1. Full pharmacokinetic sampling and serum biomarker analyses were mainly performed during cycle 1 and 2.\nTotal of six EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients including one EGFR-TKI na\u00efve patient received patritumab Process 2 formulation combined with erlotinib. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The most frequent AEs were gastrointestinal or skin toxicities, which were generally mild and manageable. One patient discontinued from study due to reversible grade 3 interstitial lung disease. The mean area under the curve (AUC) value was 2640 \u03bcg\/day\/mL; the Cmax value was 434 \u03bcg\/mL, respectively. The median progression-free survival (95% confidence interval) was 220.0 (100.0-363.0) days. HER3 ligand heregulin was detected in serum from only a patient that maintained most durable stable disease.\nPatritumab Process 2 formulation in combination with erlotinib was well tolerated compatible with favorable PK profile in Japanese patients with advanced NSCLC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002497","authors":["Toshio Shimizu","Kimio Yonesaka","Hidetoshi Hayashi","Tsutomu Iwasa","Koji Haratani","Hironori Yamada","Shoichi Ohwada","Emi Kamiyama","Kazuhiko Nakagawa"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00280-016-3231-3","first_seen_on":"2017-05-18T15:32:10+00:00","issns":["0344-5704","1432-0843"],"journal":"Cancer Chemotherapy & Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1486130738,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00280-016-3231-3"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00280-016-3231-3.pdf","pmid":"28144730","pubdate":"2017-01-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","antineoplasticagents"],"title":"Phase 1 study of new formulation of patritumab (U3-1287) Process 2, a fully human anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody in combination with erlotinib in Japanese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phase-1-study-new-formulation-patritumab-u31287-process-2-fully-human-antiher3-monoclonal-antibody-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155605,"mean":6.9067370031636,"rank":7058889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155605,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229097,"mean":12.294269921779,"rank":185747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229097,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":654,"mean":2.4790903522205,"rank":483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":654,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":3.2058823529412,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
