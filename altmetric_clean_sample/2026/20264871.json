However, these spectra generally have a large number of contributions ranging from slow diffusional modes to underdamped librations, and intramolecular vibrational modes. This makes it difficult to isolate effects such as the role of coulombic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. We have applied far-infrared and ultrafast optical Kerr-effect spectroscopies on carefully selected ions with a greater or lesser degree of symmetry in order to isolate spectral signals of interest. This has allowed us to demonstrate the presence of longitudinal and transverse optical (LO and TO) phonon modes and a great similarity to liquid water of alkylammonium-based protic ionic liquids. The data show that such phonon modes will be present in all ionic liquids requiring a reinterpretation of their spectra.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Judith Reichenbach","Stuart Ruddell","Mario Gonz\u00e1lez-Jim\u00e9nez","Julio Lemes","David Andrew Turton","David J.
