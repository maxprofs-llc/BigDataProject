All patients completed an SRS-22r questionnaire. This non-operated cohort's SRS-22r scores were compared to those of a large demographically similar cohort operated by the same surgeon. Group differences between the SRS-22r scores were evaluated by comparing these to published Minimal Clinically Important Differences (MCID) for the SRS- 22r.\nOne hundred ninety subjects with non-operated curves were compared to 166 individuals who surgery. The non-operated cohort averaged 23.5 years of age, averaged 7.7 years since curve reached 40\u00b0, and had an average 50\u00b0 Cobb angle at last follow-up. No statistical differences were found between the groups on the Pain, Function, or Mental Health domains of the SRS-22r. Statistically significant differences in favor of the operative cohort were found for Self-image, Satisfaction and Total score. The observed group differences did not meet the established thresholds for minimal clinically important differences in any of the domain scores, the average total score, or raw scores.\nThere are no meaningful clinically significant differences in SRS-22r scores at average 8 year follow-up between AIS patients with curves \u2265 40\u00b0 treated with or without surgery. These data in conjunction with an absence of long-term evidence of serious medical consequences with non-surgical management of curves \u2265 40\u00b0 should encourage surgeons to reevaluate the benefits of routine surgical care.\n3.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a7","authors":["Ward, W.
