To study tat domains that function in trans-activation, we chemically synthesized the 86 amino acid tat protein (tat-86) and tat mutant peptides. Remarkably, tat-86 is rapidly taken up by cells, and produces a massive and specific stimulation of HIV-LTR-driven RNA synthesis. Mutant peptides of 21 to 41 amino acids exhibit significant activity. Only two regions are essential for trans-activation; we suggest that one represents an activation region and the other, a nucleic acid binding or nuclear targeting region. Amino acid substitutions within these regions greatly reduce trans-activation, demonstrating the functional significance of these domains. The N-terminal 37 amino acids and exon 2 are not essential. Thus, tat is similar to regulatory proteins of Ad E1A and BPV1 E5 oncogenes, requiring only small domains for autonomous function.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c1","authors":["M Green","P M Loewenstein"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T17:51:12+00:00","issns":["0092-8674"],"issue":"6","journal":"Cell","last_mentioned_on":1303801493,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2849509"],"pmid":"2849509","pubdate":"1988-12-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Autonomous functional domains of chemically synthesized human immunodeficiency virus tat trans-activator protein.","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/autonomous-functional-domains-chemically-synthesized-human-immunodeficiency-virus-tat-transactivator"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628014,"mean":4.9445414826282,"rank":817319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628014,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95091,"mean":8.1935524660849,"rank":24698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95091,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7728,"mean":10.635422285492,"rank":2699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":2521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7728,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":89.4526,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":31,"Student  > Doctoral Student":13,"Student  > Ph.
