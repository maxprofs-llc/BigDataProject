All but one of the compounds is absorbed and excreted in bile to a significant extent. One compound, SeHCAT, has been selected for particular study. It is quantitatively absorbed from the gut at the same rate as cholic acid, and both are excreted into the bile at the same rate. It remains almost entirely confined to the enterohepatic circulation (the gut, liver, and biliary tree) and excretion is exclusively fecal. Whole-body retention, measured for 41 days, and tissue distributions suggest that the absorbed radiation dose would be small compared with that in many established tests. Such a compound offers the possibility of a simple, novel, and aesthetically acceptable method of investigating small-bowel disease. It therefore merits further investigation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da6","authors":["G S Boyd","M V Merrick","R Monks","I L Thomas"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T20:30:17+00:00","issns":["0161-5505"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1301851548,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7264761"],"pmid":"7264761","pubdate":"1981-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Se-75-labeled bile acid analogs, new radiopharmaceuticals for investigating the enterohepatic circulation.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/se75labeled-bile-acid-analogs-new-radiopharmaceuticals-investigating-enterohepatic-circulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626596,"mean":4.9527436744422,"rank":817879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626596,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94726,"mean":8.1450784270257,"rank":24547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94726,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1266,"mean":2.3841391304348,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1266,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":3.3839622641509,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
