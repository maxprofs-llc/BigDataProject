Participating in end-of-life care conversations can be emotionally challenging for everyone involved. Messages about serious or terminal illnesses can be very hard for patients and their families to hear, and physicians frequently struggle with the burden of delivering these messages. Still, evidence shows that conversations about end-of-life care options between physicians and patients can improve the quality of life of dying patients and help to relieve the emotional burden on surviving loved ones. Legislation to support these discussions by consistently reimbursing physicians for their time spent performing this service has been blocked on multiple occasions. More research on how to improve end-of-life care will enable health care providers to optimize treatment of their patients. Overcoming political divides to support end-of-life care conversations is needed to promote care that is consistent with patients' values and needs and is a key step in encouraging better quality of life for dying patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000227a","doi":"10.1059\/0003-4819-154-12-201106210-00011","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T17:14:37+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Annals of Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1319090747,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1059\/0003-4819-154-12-201106210-00011","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21690597"],"pmid":"21690597","pubdate":"2011-06-21T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Talking it out: helping our patients live better while dying.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/talking-it-helping-patients-live-better-while-dying"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633986,"mean":4.9208287981427,"rank":815877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295924,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633986,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96148,"mean":8.2951152506061,"rank":25167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96148,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4360,"mean":15.282700619408,"rank":1916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4360,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":50.490947368421,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
