The human T-cell lymphotropic viruses include those associated with T-cell malignancies (HTLV-I and HTLV-II) as well as the etiologic agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HTLV-III). Visna virus, a slowly replicating and pathogenic but nononcogenic retrovirus of sheep, is a member of the subfamily Lentivirinae. Results obtained by molecular hybridization and heteroduplex analysis indicated that a greater extent of nucleotide sequence homology exists between HTLV-III and visna virus than between HTLV-III and any of the other viruses. The homology observed under conditions of low stringency spanned the entire genome, but was strongest in the gag\/pol region. The morphogenesis and fine structure of HTLV-III and visna virus also demonstrated striking similarities. The data provide strong evidence for a close taxonomic and thus evolutionary relation between HTLV-III and the Lentivirinae subfamily.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1985Sci...227..173G","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["MA Gonda","F Wong-Staal","RC Gallo","JE Clements","O Narayan","RV Gilden","Gonda, M A","Wong-Staal, F","Gallo, R C","Clements, J E","Narayan, O","Gilden, R V"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.2981428","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T17:14:27+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1095-9203","0036-8075"],"issue":"4683","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1459476120,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.2981428","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2981428"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/227\/4683\/173.full.pdf","pmid":"2981428","pubdate":"2016-04-01T07:52:47+00:00","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Sequence homology and morphologic similarity of HTLV-III and visna virus, a pathogenic lentivirus.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1126\/science.2981428","volume":"227","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sequence-homology-morphologic-similarity-htlviii-visna-virus-pathogenic-lentivirus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7471634,"mean":6.4840103115304,"rank":473065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":6993670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7471634,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237847,"mean":8.1706229156682,"rank":20499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":217197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237847,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39252,"mean":30.880457160327,"rank":11159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":28027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39252,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":803,"mean":77.397566084788,"rank":404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":803,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
