The objectives of this multicenter prospective study were to assess the effects of surgical correction on clinical signs in dogs with brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome (BAOS) and to evaluate the levels of several biomarkers [C-reactive protein (CRP); haptoglobin (Hp), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI)] used to determine systemic inflammation and myocardial damage. This study was conducted on 33 dogs with BAOS that were evaluated before and 1 to 2 mo after surgical correction. Palatoplasty was carried out by means of 2 different surgical techniques: carbon dioxide (CO2) laser (n = 12) and electrical scalpel (n = 21). Biomarker levels (CRP, Hp, and cTnI) were determined before and after surgery. There was a significant reduction in respiratory and gastrointestinal signs in dogs with BAOS after surgical treatment (P < 0.001). A greater reduction in respiratory signs (P < 0.002) was obtained using the CO2 laser. No statistical differences were found between CRP and cTnI levels, either before or after surgical correction. Haptoglobin concentration did increase significantly in the postsurgical period (P < 0.008). Surgical treatment in dogs with BAOS reduces clinical signs, regardless of the anatomical components present. Surgical treatment for BAOS is not useful to reduce CRP and Hp levels, probably because BAOS does not induce as obvious an inflammatory process in dogs as in human patients with OSAS. No reduction in cTnI levels was observed 1 mo after surgery in dogs with BAOS, which suggests that some degree of myocardial damage remains.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dbb","authors":["Marta Planellas","Rafaela Cuenca","Maria-Dolores Tabar","Coralie Bertolani","Cyrill Poncet","Josep M Closa","Juan Lorente","Jos\u00e9 J Cer\u00f3n","Josep Pastor"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T16:57:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0830-9000"],"issue":"1","journal":"Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research","last_mentioned_on":1424058713,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25673910","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25673910?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25673910","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Clinical assessment and C-reactive protein (CRP), haptoglobin (Hp), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) values of brachycephalic dogs with upper airway obstruction before and after surgery.","type":"article","volume":"79","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-assessment-creactive-protein-crp-haptoglobin-hp-cardiac-troponin-i-ctni-values-brachycephal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4766611,"mean":5.7161277746686,"rank":1829498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2899275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4766611,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171492,"mean":8.8437977619819,"rank":57468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":112422,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171492,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":1.8813195876289,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":77,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":8,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Lecturer":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":12,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":8}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BibliotecaHUVH\/status\/566220989613506560","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3601288],"posted_on":"2015-02-13T13:02:58+00:00","author":{"name":"BibliotecaHUVH.
