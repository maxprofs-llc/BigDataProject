Using a series of S. cerevisiae BY4741-derived mutants lacking genes encoding a glycerol exporter (Fps1p) and\/or importer (Stl1p) and\/or the last kinase of the HOG pathway (Hog1p), we studied their phenotypes and various physiological characteristics with the aim of finding new roles for glycerol transporters. Though the triple mutant hog1\u0394 stl1\u0394 fps1\u0394 was viable, it was highly sensitive to various stresses. Our results showed that the function of both Stl1p and Fps1p transporters contributes to the cell ability to survive during the transfer into the state of anhydrobiosis, and that the deletion of FPS1 decreases the cell's tolerance of hyperosmotic stress. The deletion of STL1 results in a slight increase in cell size and in a substantial increase in intracellular pH. Taken together, our results suggest that the fluxes of glycerol in both directions across the plasma membrane exist in yeast cells simultaneously, and the export or import predominates according to the actual specific conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c4","authors":["Michala Duskova","Diana Borovikova","Pavla Herynkova","Alexander Rapoport","Hana Sychrova"],"doi":"10.1093\/femsle\/fnu041","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T19:10:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1574-6968"],"issue":"3","journal":"FEMS Microbiology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1423841255,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25673653?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25673653","pubdate":"2015-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"The role of glycerol transporters in yeast cells in various physiological and stress conditions.","type":"article","volume":"362","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-glycerol-transporters-yeast-cells-various-physiological-stress-conditions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4755858,"mean":5.7089565439016,"rank":3980124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4755858,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170956,"mean":8.8268797051859,"rank":137985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170956,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1064,"mean":2.4487751646284,"rank":885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1064,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":1.2123076923077,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
