Here we examined whether two metabolites of ginsenoside, protopanaxadiol (g-PPD) and protopanaxatriol (g-PPT), could modulate endothelial cell functions through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and oestrogen receptor (ER). EXPERIMENT APPROACHES: The effects of g-PPD and g-PPT on intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and nitric oxide (NO) production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were measured using Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester, 4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein and Griess reagent. Effects on expression of GR and ER isoforms in HUVECs were determined using reverse transcriptase-\/real-time PCR and immunocytochemistry. Phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) was assessed by Western blotting.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002450","authors":["Leung, Kar Wah","Leung, Fung Ping","Mak, Nai Ki","Tombran\u2010Tink, Joyce","Huang, Yu","Wong, Ricky NS"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1476-5381.2008.00066.x","endpage":"637","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T17:06:40+00:00","issns":["1476-5381","0007-1188","14765381"],"issue":"4","journal":"British Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1351479100,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1476-5381.2008.00066.x\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1476-5381.2008.00066.x\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC2697710","pmid":"19226254","pubdate":"2009-02-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"626","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Protopanaxadiol and protopanaxatriol bind to glucocorticoid and oestrogen receptors in endothelial cells","type":"article","volume":"156","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protopanaxadiol-protopanaxatriol-bind-glucocorticoid-oestrogen-receptors-endothelial-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6351884,"mean":5.9822486122622,"rank":1438620,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":4282183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6351884,"percentile":67},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200025,"mean":8.6604834119906,"rank":58520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":138602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200025,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2038,"mean":4.6772920962199,"rank":386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":1045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2038,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":4.7166774193548,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
