Each strain was examined for the presence of polysaccharide antigens of Lancefield's groups A, C, G, and F and characterized in detail as to biochemical and cultural features. On the results of these tests it is concluded that the strains should be placed in the species Streptococcus milleri. The clinical details relevant to the various strains are summarized according to the site of isolation, and their pathological significance is discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d02","authors":["P M Poole","G Wilson"],"doi":"10.1136\/jcp.29.8.740","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T20:28:43+00:00","issns":["1472-4146","0021-9746"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1374330656,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/jcp.29.8.740","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/956456","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC476157"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jcp.bmj.com\/content\/29\/8\/740.full.pdf","pmid":"956456","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Infection with minute-colony-forming beta-haemolytic streptococci.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/infection-minutecolonyforming-betahaemolytic-streptococci"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629356,"mean":4.9352152798544,"rank":816522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629356,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95339,"mean":8.2273065933837,"rank":24801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95339,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1026,"mean":2.716243902439,"rank":197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":674,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1026,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":2.5535714285714,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Streptococcus anginosus","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=565059140#altmetric_citation_5","license":"public","citation_ids":[3608781],"posted_on":"2013-07-20T14:30:56+00:00","summary":"Streptococcus anginosus is a species of Streptococcus.
