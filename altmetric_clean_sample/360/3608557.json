The measured electron-capture decay constant of hydrogenlike 140Pr58+ ions is about 50% larger than that of heliumlike 140Pr57+ ions. Moreover, 140Pr ions with one bound electron decay faster than neutral 140Pr0+ atoms with 59 electrons. To explain this peculiar observation one has to take into account the conservation of the total angular momentum, since only particular spin orientations of the nucleus and of the captured electron can contribute to the allowed decay.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Litvinov YA","Bosch F","Geissel H","Kurcewicz J","Patyk Z","Winckler N","Batist L","Beckert K","Boutin D","Brandau C","Chen L","Dimopoulou C","Fabian B","Faestermann T","Fragner A","Grigorenko L","Haettner E","Hess S","Kienle P","Kn\u00f6bel R","Kozhuharov C","Litvinov SA","Maier L","Mazzocco M","Montes F","M\u00fcnzenberg G","Musumarra A","Nociforo C","Nolden F","Pf\u00fctzner M","Plass WR","Prochazka A","Reda R","Reuschl R","Scheidenberger C","Steck M","St\u00f6hlker T","Torilov S","Trassinelli M","Sun B","Weick H","Winkler M"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T20:22:38+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"26","journal":"Physical Review Letters","last_mentioned_on":1248274772,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18233571"],"pmid":"18233571","pubdate":"2008-02-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Measurement of the beta+ and orbital electron-capture decay rates in fully ionized, hydrogenlike, and heliumlike 140Pr ions.","type":"article","volume":"99","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measurement-%CE%B2-orbital-electroncapture-decay-rates-fully-ionized-hydrogenlike-heliumlike-pr140-ions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633986,"mean":4.9208287981427,"rank":815884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295988,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633986,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96167,"mean":8.2944988457461,"rank":25173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69899,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96167,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11992,"mean":6.7802752064048,"rank":3962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":5961,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11992,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":20.039142857143,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Associate Professor":2,"Ph.D. Student":4,"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)":1,"Student (Master)":1,"Student (Bachelor)":1},"by_discipline":{"Physics":9}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CN":1,"JP":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"GSI anomaly","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=303542188#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3608554,3608557],"posted_on":"2009-07-22T14:59:32+00:00","summary":"In 2007 an experiment at GSI Darmstadt reported observing decay oscillations in the electron capture rates of highly ionized heavy atoms.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=23702563","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Pmokeefe","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Pmokeefe"}}]}}
