They appear to be associated with geographical distribution, virological characteristics, and possibly clinical outcomes. We performed sequence analysis of part of the S gene and the entire precore\/core gene of HBV isolates obtained from HBsAg-positive blood donors in Papua Province, Indonesia. Phylogenetic analysis of the S gene sequences revealed that 23 (85.2%) of the 27 HBV isolates tested belonged to genotype C (HBV\/C) and 2 (7.4%) each to HBV\/B and HBV\/D. Interestingly, 19 (82.6%) of the 23 isolates of HBV\/C clustered in a branch that was distinct from the previously reported subgenotypes C1 to C5 (HBV\/C1 to HBV\/C5). Similarly, two isolates of HBV\/D clustered in a branch distinct from the reported subgenotypes HBV\/D1 to HBV\/D5. Phylogenetic analysis of the entire precore\/core gene confirmed the consistent presence of the distinct branches in HBV\/C and HBV\/D. We therefore propose novel subgenotypes designated HBV\/C6 and HBV\/D6. The majority of HBV\/C6 isolates in Papua had alanine at positions 159 and 177 (A159\/A177) in the HBsAg. A159\/A177 is different from the determinants for adrq+ (A159\/V177), found throughout Asia, and adrq- (V159\/A177), found in New Caledonia and Polynesia, possibly representing a unique antigenic group (provisionally referred to as adrq indeterminate). In conclusion, we have identified two novel HBV subgenotypes, HBV\/C6 and HBV\/D6, the first of which is the most prevalent subgenotype of HBV in Papua, Indonesia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be9","authors":["Maria Inge Lusida","Victor Eka Nugrahaputra","Soetjipto","Retno Handajani","Motoko Nagano-Fujii","Mikiko Sasayama","Takako Utsumi","Hak Hotta"],"doi":"10.1128\/jcm.01681-07","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T16:27:18+00:00","issns":["1098-660X"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1318676599,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JCM.01681-07","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18463220","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2446895"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jcm.asm.org\/content\/46\/7\/2160.full.pdf","pmid":"18463220","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Novel Subgenotypes of Hepatitis B Virus Genotypes C and D in Papua, Indonesia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-subgenotypes-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes-c-d-papua-indonesia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626860,"mean":4.9517239589446,"rank":817845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626860,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94754,"mean":8.1451710447163,"rank":24556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94754,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2431,"mean":2.6005728395062,"rank":297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":1582,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2431,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":1.7108333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
