Transmission of eyeworms occurs via non-biting diptera that feed on the ocular secretions, tears and conjunctiva of animals. The disease, thelaziosis, is characterized by a range of subclinical to clinical signs, such as epiphora, conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal opacity and ulcers. Human thelaziosis is common in poor socio-economic settings in many Asian countries. The relationship between eyeworms and their hosts are discussed here, together with recent molecular insights that are instrumental in investigating the biology of Thelazia in their definitive and intermediate hosts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036b3","doi":"10.1016\/j.pt.2004.10.008","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T19:09:46+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Trends in Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1254903986,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.pt.2004.10.008","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15639731"],"pmid":"15639731","pubdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Thelazia eyeworm: an original endo- and ecto-parasitic nematode.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thelazia-eyeworm-original-endo-ectoparasitic-nematode"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4617414,"mean":5.4160956271844,"rank":1073423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2973155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4617414,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157354,"mean":9.031066036237,"rank":46555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":108812,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157354,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":566,"mean":4.0826017699115,"rank":166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":566,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":4.7550303030303,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
