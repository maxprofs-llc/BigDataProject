Their structures were confirmed by using UV-vis, FTIR, NMR, and ESI-MS analysis. Antifungal activity of the target compounds was preliminarily evaluated by the in vitro method against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum, Physalospora piricola, Alternaria solani, Cercospora arachidicola, and Gibberella zeae at 50 \u00b5g\/mL. Compounds 6c (R = i-Pr), 6l (R = o-NO\u2082 Bn), and 6a (R = Et) exhibited excellent antifungal activity against P. piricola with inhibition rates of 98.2%, 96.4%, and 90.7%, respectively, showing better or comparable antifungal activity than that of the commercial fungicide azoxystrobin with a 96.0% inhibition rate, which served as a positive control.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Gui-Shan Lin","Wen-Gui Duan","Lin-Xiao Yang","Min Huang","Fu-Hou Lei"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules22020193","first_seen_on":"2017-01-24T12:14:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"2","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1485260071,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/2\/193?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/2\/193?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/2\/193\/pdf","pmid":"28125042","pubdate":"2017-01-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"193","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Synthesis and Antifungal Activity of Novel Myrtenal-Based 4-Methyl-1,2,4-triazole-thioethers","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-antifungal-activity-novel"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8093786,"mean":6.8854606510969,"rank":4280679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2246776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8093786,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260776,"mean":12.833666056945,"rank":148509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":86683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260776,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3790,"mean":2.155661652151,"rank":1156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3790,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":423,"mean":1.2510047393365,"rank":133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":423,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
