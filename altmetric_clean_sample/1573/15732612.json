EBCT-derived coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores correlate with the severity of underlying coronary artery disease.\nWe followed 1173 asymptomatic patients who underwent EBCT between September 1993 and March 1994. During average follow-up of 19 months, 18 subjects had 26 cardiovascular events: 1 death, 7 myocardial infarctions, 8 coronary artery bypass graft procedures, 9 coronary angioplasties, and 1 nonhemorrhagic stroke. For CAC score thresholds of 100, 160, and 680, EBCT had sensitivities of 89%, 89%, and 50% and specificities of 77%, 82%, and 95%, respectively. Odds ratios ranged from 20.0 to 35.4 (P < .0001 for all).\nCoronary EBCT predicts future atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events in asymptomatic subjects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057f2","authors":["Yadon Arad","Louise A.
