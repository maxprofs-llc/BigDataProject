The benefit of ACT however is modest and is accompanied by important side effects.\nOne central quest in the field is therefore the identification of a predictive marker of the response to ACT.\nWe applied an unbiased approach based on high content analysis of expression data generated from a discovery patient cohort.\nWe identified MMS19, a component of the cytoplasmic Iron-Sulfur Assembly (CIA) machinery important for the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathway as a pivotal gene for cisplatin toxicity. We then confirmed the association between MMS19 expression and the response to Cisplatin treatment in a panel of NSCLC cell lines. Finally we validated these pre-clinical data in a subgroup of JBR.10 trial patients through a hypothesis-driven analysis, and showed that MMS19 levels associated with ACT benefit.\nWe therefore propose the expression level of MMS19 as a candidate predictive marker of ACT benefit in resected NSCLC patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5203cf058f610003a29","authors":["Adam, Julien","Sourisseau, Tony","Olaussen, Ken A.","Robin, Ang\u00e9lique","Zhu, Chang Q.","Templier, Alexandre","Civet, Alexandre","Girard, Philippe","Lazar, Vladimir","Validire, Pierre","Tsao, Ming S.","Soria, Jean-Charles","Besse, Benjamin"],"doi":"10.3233\/cbm-160644","first_seen_on":"2016-07-09T19:59:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1574-0153","1875-8592"],"issue":"3","journal":"Cancer Biomarkers","last_mentioned_on":1468082315,"links":["http:\/\/content.iospress.com\/articles\/cancer-biomarkers\/cbm644"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/content.iospress.com\/download\/cancer-biomarkers\/cbm644?id=cancer-biomarkers%2Fcbm644","pmid":"27802208","pubdate":"2016-06-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOS Press","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","biochemistry"],"title":"MMS19 as a potential predictive marker of adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in resected non-small cell lung cancer","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mms19-potential-predictive-marker-adjuvant-chemotherapy-benefit-resected-nonsmall-cell-lung-cancer-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8037685,"mean":6.8229478924494,"rank":6957737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8037685,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258923,"mean":11.585156896672,"rank":217512,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258923,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":1.0530496453901,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.56818181818182,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"reddit":[{"title":"MMS19 as a potential predictive marker of adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in resected non-small cell lung cancer","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nsclc\/comments\/4s11ry\/mms19_as_a_potential_predictive_marker_of\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[9540871],"posted_on":"2016-07-09T16:38:35+00:00","author":{"name":"montaukwhaler","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nsclc","id_on_source":"nsclc","followers":1,"subreddit":"non small cell lung cancer"}}]}}
