Methods Fifty SAMP8 mice (aged 8 months) were randomly divided into 5 groups, (150, 300, 600) mg\/kg TF-LBM groups, 0.65 g\/kg donepezil HCl group and AD model group; 10 SAMR1 mice (aged 8 months) were used as a control group of normal aging. The AD model group and the normal aging control group were given the same volume of distilled water as TF-LBM groups. Eight weeks after intragastric administration, Morris water maze experiment was conducted to calculate the latency of place navigation. After the behavioral experiment, the brain cortical tissue and hippocampus (CA1 region) of the mice from various groups were taken to observe the morphological changes of the cortical tissue and hippocampus and test IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 content. Results Compared with the model group, the escape latency of the normal aging group, the high-dose TF-LBM group and the donepezil HCl group were evidently shortened; compared with the normal aging group, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1of the model group increased significantly; compared with the model group, IL-1\u03b2 content of the low-dose TF-LBM group had no obvious difference, while IL-1\u03b2 content of the median-dose and high-dose TF-LBM groups and the donepezil HCl group decreased significantly; IL-6 content decreased in all TF-LBM groups and the donepezil HCl group; TNF-\u03b1 level in the low-dose and median-dose TF-LBM groups had no evident difference, while it was reduced significantly in the high-dose TF-LBM group and the donepezil HCl group. Compared with the normal aging group, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 content of the model group increased significantly; compared with the model group, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 content of all TF-LBM groups and the donepezil HCl group decreased. Conclusion TF-LBM can improve the behavior change of SAMP8 mice with AD. TF-LBM can reduce the content of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in cerebral cortex and hippocampus CA1.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd0f","authors":["Yang, Bailing","Hou, Qian","Hu, Feng","Zhang, Fan"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-10T00:51:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1007-8738"],"issue":"7","journal":"Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology","last_mentioned_on":1468019684,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27363265"],"pmid":"27363265","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"[Total flavones derived from Lagotis brevituba maxim reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease mice].","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/total-flavones-derived-lagotis-brevituba-maxim-reduce-levels-inflammatory-cytokines-cerebral-cortex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029393,"mean":6.8051641093086,"rank":1136150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6819966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029393,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258713,"mean":11.600497232444,"rank":51994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":203365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258713,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230,"mean":0.81200873362445,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.45833333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"[Total flavones derived from Lagotis brevituba maxim reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease mice].","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=27195183096&p=1pl&v=1&x=Lq5dWb3rK-yq6gRoTCBJoA","license":"public","citation_ids":[9543265],"posted_on":"2016-07-08T23:14:44+00:00","summary":".
