It occurs mainly in aging and severe atherosclerotic damage of the aortic wall. Even though surgical intervention is effective to prevent rupture, surgery for the thoracic and thoraco-abdominal aorta is an invasive procedure with high mortality and morbidity. Therefore, an alternative strategy for treatment of AA is required. Recently, the molecular pathology of AA has been clarified. AA is caused by an imbalance between the synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrices in the aortic wall. Chronic inflammation enhances the degradation of matrices directly and indirectly, making control of the chronic inflammation crucial for aneurysmal development. Meanwhile, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to be obtained from an adult population and to differentiate into various types of cells. In addition, MSCs have not only the potential anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties but also can be recruited into damaged tissue. MSCs have been widely used as a source for cell therapy to treat various diseases involving graft-versus-host disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, and chronic inflammatory disease such as Crohn's disease clinically. Therefore, administration of MSCs might be available to treat AA using anti-inflammatory and immnosuppressive properties. This review provides a summary of several studies on \"Cell Therapy for Aortic Aneurysm\" including our recent data, and we also discuss the possibility of this kind of treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc97","authors":["Aika Yamawaki-Ogata","Ryotaro Hashizume","Xian-Ming Fu","Akihiko Usui","Yuji Narita"],"doi":"10.4252\/wjsc.v6.i3.278","first_seen_on":"2014-08-12T14:49:17+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"3","journal":"World Journal of Stem Cells","last_mentioned_on":1415575424,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4109132\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25067996"],"pmcid":"PMC4109132","pmid":"25067996","pubdate":"2014-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Baishideng Publishing Group Co., Ltd.","startpage":"278","title":"Mesenchymal stem cells for treatment of aortic aneurysms.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mesenchymal-stem-cells-treatment-aortic-aneurysms-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.858,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.858},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4483765,"mean":4.7743486063745,"rank":327554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":4156280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4483765,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110589,"mean":7.3170456107354,"rank":11330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":99252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110589,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":1.534380952381,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.8375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Chronic Inflammation Chews Up Your Blood Vessels","url":"https:\/\/www.fightaging.org\/archives\/2014\/08\/chronic-inflammation-chews-up-your-blood-vessels.php","citation_ids":[2590086,2590087],"posted_on":"2014-08-11T22:48:00+00:00","summary":"A number of the most serious age-related conditions involve the progressive structural and functional decay of your blood vessels.
