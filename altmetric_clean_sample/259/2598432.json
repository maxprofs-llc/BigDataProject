Despite being very similar to the female, the male presents more robust metasomal segments. Additionally, the distribution of the sexual populations of another two species of the T. stigmurus complex is reported herein: T. serrulatus Lutz & Mello, 1922 and T. stigmurus (Thorell, 1877). Males of T. serrulatus were, until now, restricted to the Minas Gerais State (Southwestern region of Brazil), and with new records reported here, its known distribution now encompasses the Northeastern region of Brazil. Males of T. stigmurus were previously recorded only for two municipalities in the State of Bahia, and here we present eight new records for Bahia State and one for Pernambuco State. We present a key to related species of the T. stigmurus complex based on morphology and coloration pattern.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53d3cf058f610004744","authors":["Maria Dulcineia dos Santos","Maria Dulcineia dos Santos","Tiago Jord\u00e3o Porto","Rej\u00e2ne Maria Lira da Silva","Tania Brazil"],"doi":"10.3897\/zookeys.435.6694","first_seen_on":"2014-08-18T17:36:16+00:00","issns":["1313-2970"],"journal":"ZooKeys","last_mentioned_on":1411802012,"links":["http:\/\/www.pensoft.net\/journals\/zookeys\/article\/6694\/#.U-_JTPG95M4.facebook","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3897\/zookeys.435.6694","http:\/\/zookeys.pensoft.net\/articles.php?id=3993#articles.php?id=3993&_suid=141180150183506054445851849198"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pensoft.net\/inc\/journals\/download.php?fileTable=J_GALLEYS&fileId=9022","pmid":"25152686","publisher":"Pensoft Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Description of the male of Tityus kuryi Louren\u00e7o, 1997 and notes about males of Tityus stigmurus (Thorell, 1877) and Tityus serrulatus Lutz & Mello, 1922 (Scorpiones, Buthidae)","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/description-male-tityus-kuryi-louren%C3%A7o-1997-notes-about-males-tityus-stigmurus-thorell-1877-tityus-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.532,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.532},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4301343,"mean":4.9825575337031,"rank":646479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3654864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4301343,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108949,"mean":7.7582992620333,"rank":20356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":88592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108949,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1387,"mean":11.299812409812,"rank":400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1387,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":13.200444444444,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
