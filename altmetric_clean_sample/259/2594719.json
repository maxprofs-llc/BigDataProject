The medial forebrain bundle (MFB) is an important pathway of the reward system. Two branches have been described using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based tractography: the infero-medial MFB (imMFB) and the supero-lateral MFB (slMFB). Previous studies point to white-matter microstructural alterations of the slMFB in major depressive disorder (MDD) during acute episodes. To extend this finding, this study investigates whether white-matter microstructure is also altered in MDD patients that are in remission. Further, we explore associations between diffusion MRI-based metrics of white-matter microstructure of imMFB, slMFB and hedonic tone, the ability to derive pleasure. Method. Eighteen remitted depressed (RD) and 22 never depressed (ND) participants underwent high angular resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (HARDI) scans. To reconstruct the two pathways of the MFB (imMFB and slMFB) we used the damped Richardson-Lucy (dRL) algorithm. Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) was sampled along the tracts. Results. Mean FA of imMFB, slMFB and a comparison tract (the middle cerebellar peduncle) did not differ between ND and RD participants. Hedonic capacity correlated negatively with mean FA of the left slMFB, explaining 21% of the variance. Conclusions. Diffusion MRI-based metrics of white-matter microstructure of the MFB in RD do not differ from ND. Hedonic capacity is associated with altered white-matter microstructure of the slMFB.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d9","authors":["Bracht T","Doidge AN","Keedwell PA","Jones DK"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0033291714001949","first_seen_on":"2014-08-18T12:20:07+00:00","funders":["wellcome"],"issns":["1469-8978"],"journal":"Psychological Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1423145802,"links":["http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayFulltext?aid=9322236&fid=9322237&fromPage=cupadmin&issueId=-1&jid=PSM&pdftype=6316268&repository=authInst&type=6&volumeId=-1","http:\/\/www.journals.cambridge.org\/abstract_S0033291714001949","http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?aid=9322236&fileId=S0033291714001949&fromPage=online&fulltextType=RA","http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?aid=9546972&fromPage=online","http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9546972&utm_source=Issue_Alert&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=PSM"],"pmid":"25124530","pubdate":"2014-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Hedonic tone is associated with left supero-lateral medial forebrain bundle microstructure","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hedonic-tone-associated-left-superolateral-medial-forebrain-bundle-microstructure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4720494,"mean":5.6985437665106,"rank":1955837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2683776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4720494,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118706,"mean":8.35102839813,"rank":42418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":73890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118706,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1854,"mean":6.9092584997302,"rank":992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1854,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":17.1775,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
