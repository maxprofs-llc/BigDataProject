Development studies with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) demonstrated that adding P80 resulted in a more robust manufacturing process. Prior to adding P80 to the formulation of PCV13, we investigated the immunogenicity and safety of PCV13 with and without P80.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008487","authors":["Gadzinowski J","Tansey SP","Wysocki J","Kopi\u0144ska E","Majda-Stanis\u0142awska E","Czajka H","Korbal P","Pietrzyk JJ","Baker SA","Giardina PC","Gruber WC","Emini EA","Scott DA","Janusz Gadzinowski","Susan P.
