Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are often based on motor- and\/or sensory processes that are known to be impaired in late stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We propose a novel BCI designed for patients in late stages of ALS that only requires high-level cognitive processes to transmit information from the user to the BCI. Approach. We trained subjects via EEG-based neurofeedback to self-regulate the amplitude of gamma-oscillations in the superior parietal cortex (SPC). We argue that parietal gamma-oscillations are likely to be associated with high-level attentional processes, thereby providing a communication channel that does not rely on the integrity of sensory- and\/or motor-pathways impaired in late stages of ALS. Main results. Healthy subjects quickly learned to self-regulate gamma-power in the SPC by alternating between states of focused attention and relaxed wakefulness, resulting in an average decoding accuracy of 70.2%. One locked-in ALS patient (ALS-FRS-R score of zero) achieved an average decoding accuracy significantly above chance-level though insufficient for communication (55.8%). Significance. Self-regulation of gamma-power in the SPC is a feasible paradigm for brain-computer interfacing and may be preserved in late stages of ALS. This provides a novel approach to testing whether completely locked-in ALS patients retain the capacity for goal-directed thinking.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d8e","authors":["Grosse-Wentrup M","Sch\u00f6lkopf B"],"doi":"10.1088\/1741-2560\/11\/5\/056015","first_seen_on":"2014-08-18T12:38:30+00:00","issns":["1741-2560"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Neural Engineering","last_mentioned_on":1433585395,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25125446","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25125446?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25125446","pubdate":"2014-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering","neurology"],"title":"A brain-computer interface based on self-regulation of gamma-oscillations in the superior parietal cortex.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/braincomputer-interface-based-selfregulation-gammaoscillations-superior-parietal-cortex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6921953,"mean":6.216605229563,"rank":5162740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":988684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6921953,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179017,"mean":7.3180299079414,"rank":114787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":36580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179017,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":489,"mean":8.8250245901639,"rank":393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":489,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":4.9604166666667,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
