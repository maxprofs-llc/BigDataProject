Cloud computing environments provide several benefits to all the stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem (patients, providers, payers, etc.). Lack of data interoperability standards and solutions has been a major obstacle in the exchange of healthcare data between different stakeholders. We propose an EHR system - cloud health information systems technology architecture (CHISTAR) that achieves semantic interoperability through the use of a generic design methodology which uses a reference model that defines a general purpose set of data structures and an archetype model that defines the clinical data attributes. CHISTAR application components are designed using the cloud component model approach that comprises of loosely coupled components that communicate asynchronously. In this paper, we describe the high-level design of CHISTAR and the approaches for semantic interoperability, data integration, and security.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56b89c912a83ee67498b457b","authors":["Bahga A","Madisetti VK"],"doi":"10.1109\/jbhi.2013.2257818","first_seen_on":"2014-08-18T14:49:05+00:00","issns":["2168-2194"],"issue":"5","journal":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","last_mentioned_on":1408286628,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25055368?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25055368","pubdate":"2014-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","title":"A Cloud-based Approach for Interoperable Electronic Health Records (EHRs).","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cloudbased-approach-interoperable-electronic-health-records-ehrs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
