Accurate interpretation of these responses may be confounded by peripheral as well as central nervous system mechanisms. Examples of such peripheral nervous system mechanisms likely to be of relevance to therapists have been selected from basic and clinical research. Symptomatic relief has been inferred to endorse the diagnostic specificity of mechanical stimulation. The extent to which this would be valid for relief acquired by neurological means is discussed in terms of endogenous pain inhibitory systems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5493cf058f6100047a4","doi":"10.1016\/s0004-9514(14)60452-9","first_seen_on":"2014-08-18T16:37:28+00:00","issns":["00049514"],"journal":"Australian Journal of Physiotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1408249370,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0004951414604529"],"pmid":"25026489","pubdate":"1994-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"title":"The meaning of mechanically produced responses ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/meaning-mechanically-produced-responses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4148169,"mean":5.1155399677872,"rank":3143795,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":829979,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4148169,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105726,"mean":8.0476720170253,"rank":79564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":21459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105726,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":3.5755555555556,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":3.277,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
