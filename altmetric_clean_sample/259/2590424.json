The methylation status of target genes in circulating DNA was evaluated by methods based on preliminary bisulfi te conversion of DNA. We used a different approach based on selection of hypermethylated sequences of circulating DNA by means of DNA-methyl-binding protein (methylated CpG island recovery assay, MIRA). Methylation was evaluated for RAR\u03b22 tumor suppression gene in circulating DNA in lung cancer and a trend was detected to higher methylation of this gene in the patients in comparison with healthy donors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000246e","authors":["K Yu Kapitskaya","T L Azhikina","A A Ponomaryova","N V Cherdyntseva","V V Vlasov","P P Laktionov","E Yu Rykova"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10517-014-2604-z","first_seen_on":"2014-08-12T16:29:52+00:00","issns":["1573-8221"],"journal":"Bulletin of Experimental Biology & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1407860893,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25110096?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25110096","pubdate":"2014-08-12T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"MIRA Analysis of RAR\u03b22 Gene Methylation in DNA Circulating in the Blood in Lung Cancer.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mira-analysis-rar%CE%B22-gene-methylation-dna-circulating-blood-lung-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":4199467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127255,"mean":8.4440617505149,"rank":102549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127255,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":374,"mean":1.3564343163539,"rank":216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":374,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.67727272727273,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
