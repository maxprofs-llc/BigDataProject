Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the strain formed a monophyletic clade with the closely related type strains of Clostridium cluster I and was most closely related to Clostridium amylolyticum JCM 14823(T) (94.38\u00a0%). The temperature, pH, and NaCl range for growth was determined to be 20-45\u00a0\u00b0C (optimum 37\u00a0\u00b0C), 4.0-10.0 (optimum pH 7.3), and 0-3.0\u00a0% (w\/v), respectively. The strain was able to tolerate up to 7.5\u00a0% (v\/v) ethanol. Yeast extract or peptone was found to be required for growth. Acids were found to be produced from glucose, mannose and trehalose. The major end products from glucose fermentation were identified as ethanol, acetate and hydrogen. The polar lipids were found to consist of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and unidentified phospholipids and polar lipids. The major fatty acids (>5\u00a0%) were identified as iso-C15:0, C16:0, C16:0 dma, C14:0, anteiso-C15:0 and iso-C13:0. No respiratory quinone was detected. The diamino acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan was identified as meso-diaminopimelic acid and the whole-cell sugars were found to include galactose and glucose as major components. The DNA G+C content was determined to be 36.4\u00a0mol%. Based on the phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic evidence, the isolate is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Clostridium for which the name Clostridium swellfunianum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is S11-3-10(T) (=DSM 27788(T)\u00a0=\u00a0JCM 19606(T)\u00a0=\u00a0CICC 10730(T)).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f6100064e7","authors":["Chaolan Liu","Dan Huang","Laiyan Liu","Jin Zhang","Yu Deng","Ling Chen","Wenxue Zhang","Zhengyun Wu","Ao Fan","Dengyi Lai","Lirong Dai"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10482-014-0251-z","first_seen_on":"2014-08-13T00:23:47+00:00","issns":["1572-9699"],"journal":"Antonie van Leeuwenhoek","last_mentioned_on":1407889389,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25103947?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25103947","pubdate":"2014-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Clostridium swellfunianum sp. nov., a novel anaerobic bacterium isolated from the pit mud of Chinese Luzhou-flavor liquor production.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clostridium-swellfunianum-sp-nov-novel-anaerobic-bacterium-isolated-pit-mud-chinese-luzhouflavor-liq"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4136710,"mean":5.1105400203632,"rank":3310702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":103667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4136710,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103792,"mean":8.1007121234019,"rank":82954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103792,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":506,"mean":1.6716475247525,"rank":337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":506,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":0.90625,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/status\/499350410243878912","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2591591],"posted_on":"2014-08-13T00:23:09+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
