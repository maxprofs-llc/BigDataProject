In this work, we have studied the influence of the nanopore surface state on charged polymer nanoparticle translocations. To make this, the translocation of carboxylate modified polystyrene microspheres (diameter 40, 70 and 100 nm) has been investigated through two kinds of high aspect ratio nanopores (negative and uncharged). The latter were tailored by a single track-etched and atomic layer deposition technique. It was shown that the mobility and the energy barrier are strongly dependent on nanopore surface charge. Typically if the latter exhibits negative surface charge, the microsphere mobility increases and the global energy barrier of entrance inside the nanopore decreases with its diameter, converse to the uncharged nanopore.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f61000898b","authors":["Simon Cabello-Aguilar","Adib ABOU CHAAYA","Mikhael Bechelany","celine Pochat-Bohatier","Emmanuel Balanzat","jean marc janot","Philippe MIELE","philippe d\u00e9jardin","sebastien balme","Adib Abou Chaaya","C\u00e9line Pochat-Bohatier","Jean-Marc Janot","Philippe Miele","S\u00e9bastien Balme"],"doi":"10.1039\/c4sm00392f","endpage":"8419","first_seen_on":"2014-08-18T11:15:33+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1744-6848","1744-683X"],"issue":"42","journal":"Soft Matter","last_mentioned_on":1408357012,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2014\/SM\/C4SM00392F#%21divAbstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2014\/sm\/c4sm00392f","pmid":"25204833","pubdate":"2014-10-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"8413","title":"Dynamics of polymer nanoparticles through a single artificial nanopore with high-aspect-ratio","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dynamics-polymer-nanoparticles-through-single-artificial-nanopore-highaspectratio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":2284928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1641581,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":36},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112991,"mean":8.0595086998853,"rank":55500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":43990,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112991,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1481,"mean":1.8707689189189,"rank":445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1481,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":4.011,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
