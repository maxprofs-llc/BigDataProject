They highlight the importance of family therapy continuing to cut across disciplines, the power of systems ideas in widely diverse settings and institutions (such as courts, HIV projects, working with people forced into exile), extensive new mental health initiatives (such as in Turkey and India), as well as the range of family therapy journals available (four alone in Spain). Many family therapy groups are collaborating across organizations (especially in Asia) and the article presents other ideas for connections such as a clearing house to inexpensively translate family therapy articles into other languages.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028ad","authors":["Roberts, Janine","Abu\u2010Baker, Khawla","Diez Fern\u00e1ndez, Cristina","Chong Garcia, Nelly","Fredman, Glenda","Kamya, Hugo","Mart\u00edn Higarza, Yolanda","Fortes de Leff, Jacqueline","Messent, Philip","Nakamura, Shin\u2010Ichi","Torun Reid, Fatma","Sim, Timothy","Subrahmanian, Chitra","Zevallos Vega, Roxana"],"doi":"10.1111\/famp.12093","endpage":"576","first_seen_on":"2014-08-18T18:23:03+00:00","issns":["1545-5300","0014-7370"],"issue":"3","journal":"Family Process","last_mentioned_on":1408386152,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/famp.12093\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/famp.12093\/pdf","pmid":"25099431","pubdate":"2014-08-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"544","subjects":["socialsciences","primaryhealthcare","psychology"],"title":"Up Close: Family Therapy Challenges and Innovations Around the World","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/up-close-family-therapy-challenges-innovations-around-world"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6263648,"mean":5.9879266124041,"rank":4631626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":938810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6263648,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142989,"mean":8.2479824880411,"rank":94828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":28994,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142989,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":214,"mean":3.3805539906103,"rank":169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":214,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.58333333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
