Dissection of the 13-subunit complex reveals that the Eaf7 subunit bridges Eaf5 with Eaf3, a H3K36me3-binding chromodomain protein, and this Eaf5\/7\/3 trimer is anchored to NuA4 through Eaf5. This trimeric subcomplex represents a functional module, and a large portion exists in a native form outside the NuA4 complex. Gene-specific and genome-wide location analyses indicate that Eaf5\/7\/3 correlates with transcription activity and is enriched over the coding region. In agreement with a role in transcription elongation, the Eaf5\/7\/3 trimer interacts with phosphorylated RNA polymerase II and helps its progression. Loss of Eaf5\/7\/3 partially suppresses intragenic cryptic transcription arising in set2 mutants, supporting a role in nucleosome destabilization. On the other hand, loss of the trimer leads to an increase of replication-independent histone exchange over the coding region of transcribed genes. Taken together, these results lead to a model where Eaf5\/7\/3 associates with elongating polymerase to promote the disruption of nucleosomes in its path, but also their refolding in its wake.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Rossetto D","Cramet M","Wang AY","Steunou AL","Lacoste N","Schulze JM","C\u00f4t\u00e9 V","Monnet-Saksouk J","Piquet S","Nourani A","Kobor MS","C\u00f4t\u00e9 J"],"doi":"10.15252\/embj.201386433","first_seen_on":"2014-08-12T18:50:22+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["0261-4189"],"issue":"","journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1407920744,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24843044?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24843044","pubdate":"2014-05-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Eaf5\/7\/3 form a functionally independent NuA4 submodule linked to RNA polymerase II-coupled nucleosome recycling.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/eaf573-form-functionally-independent-nua4-submodule-linked-rna-polymerase-iicoupled-nucleosome-recyc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4136710,"mean":5.1105400203632,"rank":3086458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1000408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4136710,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103677,"mean":8.0923557621822,"rank":76968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":25300,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103677,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4185,"mean":3.3108212237094,"rank":3443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4185,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":8.8871578947368,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
