Persons at risk for disease or who are simply curious about their genomes can have them analyzed. An individual's genome is a function of ancestry, family history and personal health and environmental exposures. Clinical and pharmacologic information can be obtained through genomic analysis. Genomic testing can be done by health care providers but some results can now be obtained through direct-to-consumer tests. Many ethical questions are being raised regarding genomic testing. Nurses can provide more optimal care by understanding the process of genomic testing as well as the implications of the results.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5a23cf058f6100052af","authors":["Klein EL","Klein, Elisabeth (Lisa) Z."],"doi":"10.1111\/1751-486x.12111","endpage":"153","first_seen_on":"2014-08-12T18:02:40+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1751-4851","1751-486X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Nursing for Women's Health","last_mentioned_on":1431712581,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1111\/1751-486X.12111\/;jsessionid=E460783DE3B7EBF080B5F1D0F01E35E2.f01t01?identityKey=206fdfe6-12d3-4769-befa-651c65ae965b","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1111\/1751-486X.12111\/;jsessionid=CC3F97CDED25116A1677DE275C0A8B12.f01t02?identityKey=d10f6e10-04b7-4660-9f1f-8bcf7e01dd0b","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1111\/1751-486X.12111\/;jsessionid=4FDB9205C23D460438F6C4D46A5C6B69.f04t02?identityKey=a67f8d6b-0d8a-4412-a1eb-89f864081a72","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1111\/1751-486X.12111\/;jsessionid=09AA20B3207ADCB598ADE812826C4E90.f01t01?identityKey=d8b6ed96-e247-4cdc-a95f-1da33bc121ce","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24750654\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1751-486X.12111\/pdf","pmid":"24750654","pubdate":"2014-04-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"149","subjects":["nursing","obstetrics","perinatology"],"title":"The Increasing Role of Genetics and Genomics in Women's Health.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increasing-role-genetics-genomics-womens-health-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.65,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.65},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8291699,"mean":6.9874673064484,"rank":1026913,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7263116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8291699,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182978,"mean":7.7737499139239,"rank":25327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":157589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182978,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":2.9292,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":12.733333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Philosophy":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":7,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ANACnurses\/status\/466604964002168832","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2590753],"posted_on":"2014-05-14T15:44:27+00:00","author":{"name":"ANAC Nurses","url":"http:\/\/NURSESinAIDScare.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/484764604652740609\/zAthrweS_normal.jpeg","description":"Association of Nurses in AIDS Care -
