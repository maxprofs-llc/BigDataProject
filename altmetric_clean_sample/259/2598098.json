Although parenteral glucagon is effective in treating these reactions, it is cumbersome to use, causes severe nausea, and is impractical in the school setting. Epinephrine is available as a premixed injection (Epipen) that may be used by all care providers. Using Epipen to treat hypoglycemia may be an effective, safe, and easy-to-use alternative to glucagon.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f8","authors":["Teresa P.C.
