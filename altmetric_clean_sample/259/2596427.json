Their evasion strategies have shaped every facet of the immune system, driving diversity within gene families and immune gene polymorphisms within populations. New studies published recently in BMC Biology and Journal of Experimental Medicine document parasite-associated immunosuppression in natural populations and suggest that host genetic variants favoring resistance to parasites may be detrimental in the absence of infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b5","doi":"10.1186\/jbiol166","first_seen_on":"2014-08-18T14:14:44+00:00","issns":["1475-4924"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Biology","last_mentioned_on":1281936809,"links":["http:\/\/jbiol.com\/content\/8\/7\/62","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/jbiol166","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19664200","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2736671"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jbiol.com\/content\/pdf\/jbiol166.pdf","pmid":"19664200","pubdate":"2009-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"62","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Parasite immunomodulation and polymorphisms of the immune system","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parasite-immunomodulation-polymorphisms-immune-system"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3927047,"mean":5.0186583714733,"rank":3134181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":96833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3927047,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100469,"mean":7.9591301448266,"rank":79905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100469,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":5.7016164383562,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
