PCC 6803 GT strain under photoautotrophic conditions by isotopically nonstationary metabolic flux analysis (INST-MFA). A \u0394nrtABCD mutant of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was constructed to reproduce phenotypes arising during nitrogen starvation. The \u0394nrtABCD mutant and the wild type GT strain were cultured under photoautotrophic conditions by a photobioreactor. Intracellular metabolites were labeled over a time course using NaH(13)CO3 as a carbon source. Based on this data, the metabolic flux distributions in the wild type and \u0394nrtABCD cells were estimated by INST-MFA. The wild type GT and \u0394nrtABCD strains displayed similar distribution patterns, although the absolute levels of metabolic flux were lower in \u0394nrtABCD Furthermore, the relative flux levels for glycogen metabolism, anaplerotic reactions, and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway were increased in \u0394nrtABCD. This was likely due to the increased expression of enzyme genes that respond to nitrogen depletion. Additionally, we found that the ratio of ATP\/NADPH demand increased slightly in the \u0394nrtABCD mutant. These results indicated that futile ATP consumption increase under nitrogen-limited conditions because the Calvin-Benson cycle and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway form a metabolic futile cycle that consumes ATP without CO2 fixation and NADPH regeneration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003330","authors":["Nakajima, Tsubasa","Yoshikawa, Katsunori","Toya, Yoshihiro","Matsuda, Fumio","Shimizu, Hiroshi"],"doi":"10.1093\/pcp\/pcw233","first_seen_on":"2017-01-28T14:16:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0032-0781","1471-9053"],"journal":"Plant & Cell Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1485612132,"links":["https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/pcp\/article-abstract\/2959855\/Metabolic-flux-analysis-of-Synechocystis-sp-PCC"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/pcp\/article-pdf\/doi\/10.1093\/pcp\/pcw233\/9963502\/pcw233.pdf","pmid":"28130420","pubdate":"2017-01-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"pcw233","subjects":["cellbiology","botany"],"title":"\n              Metabolic flux analysis of\n              Synechocystis\n              sp.
