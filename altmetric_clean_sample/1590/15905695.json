Therefore, identifying gut microbes will shed light on understanding the annual life of animal species, particularly those that are threatened or endangered. In the present study, we conducted nucleotide sequence analyses of the 16S rRNA genes of gut microbiome of the hooded cranes (Grus monacha) wintering at Shengjin Lake, China, by Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. We acquired 503,398 high-quality sequences and 785 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from 15 fecal samples from different cranes, representing 22 phyla that were dominated by Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. A total of 305 genera were identified that were dominated by Clostridium, Lysinibacillus, and Enterobacter. The core gut microbiome comprised 26 genera, including many probiotic species such as Clostridium, Bacillus, Cellulosilyticum, and Cellulomonas that could catabolize cellulose. The findings reported here contribute to our knowledge of the microbiology of hooded cranes and will likely advance efforts to protect waterbirds that inhabit Shengjin Lake Reserve during winter.","altmetric_jid":"53222dc92a83ee27268b4587","authors":["Zhao, Guanghong","Zhou, Lizhi","Dong, Yuanqiu","Cheng, Yuanyuan","Song, Yunwei"],"doi":"10.1002\/mbo3.447","first_seen_on":"2017-01-28T08:33:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["20458827","2045-8827"],"journal":"MicrobiologyOpen","last_mentioned_on":1486051257,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mbo3.447\/abstract;jsessionid=20744BBB5A3B4153710C7436D1057ABE.f03t04?systemMessage=WOL+Usage+report+download+page+will+be+unavailable+on+Friday+27th+January+2017+at+23%3A00+GMT%2F+18%3A00+EST%2F+07%3A00+SGT+%28Saturday+28th+Jan+for+SGT%29++for+up+to+2+hours+due+to+essential+server+maintenance.+Apologies+for+the+inconvenience","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mbo3.447\/full","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mbo3.447\/full?hootPostID=61ff653d2d89e6d42bae8e55f0bbe87b","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mbo3.447\/full?hootPostID=47f2a021bf7e131744a0625dc5b119f5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mbo3.447\/pdf","pmid":"28127902","pubdate":"2017-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"\n              The gut microbiome of hooded cranes (\n              Grus monacha\n              ) wintering at Shengjin Lake, China\n            ","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/mbo3.447","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gut-microbiome-hooded-cranes-grus-monacha-wintering-shengjin-lake-china"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.33,"score_history":{"1y":8.33,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.33},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150076,"mean":6.9043957460448,"rank":1021393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7127006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150076,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263391,"mean":12.828005505144,"rank":49855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":213257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263391,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277,"mean":4.4304637681159,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":8.8375,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
