Evidence suggests that nurses can be trained to deliver SFBT with only a few days training. It has been argued that SFBT reflects the core values of nursing practice, but no empirical research has been undertaken to validate this assertion. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This is the first time the impact of such training on nurses' sense of professional and personal identity has been explored. Drawing upon data derived from twenty interviews, this paper explores the key themes reported by nurses in relation to their personal experience of training in SFBT. This paper extends our understanding of the lived experience of mental health nurses and facilitates discussion on the preparation and practice of their role. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Training in SFBT can provide a framework for nurses to empower their clients\/patients to take control of their own recovery in a shared and trusting relationship. Training in SFBT can enhance nurses' sense of trust in their clients. Training in solution-focused interactions may provide a framework for many nurses to provide the type of collaborative, patient-led care they aspire to.\nIntroduction SFBT is a psychotherapeutic model that aims to 'build solutions' rather than 'solve problems'. It has evolved into a structured communication framework utilized across a range of disciplines, focusing on the future, as opposed to the past, and on participant's strengths and abilities, as opposed to their problems and deficits. There have been no studies exploring the experience of training in SFBT from the perspective of the nurses being trained. Aim This study sought to explore the experience of nurses who had completed a six-month training course in SFBT. Methods Using a qualitative methodology, 20 nurses who had undertaken SFBT training were interviewed at various locations across Scotland. Results Five main themes emerged from analysis of the 20 interviews. Many of the participants reported increased trust in their clients and enhanced role satisfaction. Implications for Practice Training in SFBT provides nurses with an alternative model of practice to the dominant 'medical' and 'psychological' models of contemporary practice. The experiences of the participants in this study suggest that SFBT can be a useful intervention in nursing practice and that nurses can easily incorporate SFBT into their practice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ee5","authors":["Smith, S.","Macduff, C."],"doi":"10.1111\/jpm.12365","first_seen_on":"2017-01-28T09:37:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["13510126","1365-2850"],"journal":"Journal of Psychiatric & Mental Health Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1486875000,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jpm.12365\/full","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jpm.12365\/abstract;jsessionid=B003125E6DC947CEA481EE335517BE24.f01t01?systemMessage=WOL+Usage+report+download+page+will+be+unavailable+on+Friday+27th+January+2017+at+23%3A00+GMT%2F+18%3A00+EST%2F+07%3A00+SGT+%28Saturday+28th+Jan+for+SGT%29++for+up+to+2+hours+due+to+essential+server+maintenance.+Apologies+for+the+inconvenience"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jpm.12365\/pdf","pmid":"28124407","pubdate":"2017-01-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","psychiatry","psychology"],"title":"A thematic analysis of the experience of UK mental health nurses who have trained in Solution Focused Brief Therapy","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/jpm.12365","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thematic-analysis-experience-uk-mental-health-nurses-trained-solution-focused-brief-therapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.13,"score_history":{"1y":11.13,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.13},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200733,"mean":6.9347145888862,"rank":747805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7452918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200733,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265921,"mean":12.802176654633,"rank":38775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":227132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265921,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":608,"mean":4.5818517298188,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":608,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":11.743225806452,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JPMHNursing\/statuses\/825276471145091072","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15906506],"posted_on":"2017-01-28T09:36:58+00:00","author":{"name":"JPMHN","url":"http:\/\/www.wileyonlinelibrary.com\/journal\/jpm","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/607922881331384320\/L9GIHkez_normal.jpg","description":"Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing.
