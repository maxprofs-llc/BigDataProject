Patients completed the MSQ questionnaire as well as the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM).\nPerformance in various domains of sexual function was evaluated using the MSQ and SHIM questionnaires.\nA total of 295 men with a mean age of 40.7 \u00b1 14.5 years were evaluated. The median time since SCI was 3.6 (1.6-7.0) years. Erectile function, ejaculation, and orgasm were the most severely affected domains. The median MSQ score was 40 (8-66), and the median SHIM score was 5 (0-16). The diagnostic properties of the two instruments were similar in the discrimination of sexually active subjects. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.950 (95% CI 0.923-0.979) for the MSQ and 0.942 (95% CI 0.915-0.968) for the SHIM. There was a strong correlation between the two instruments (r=0.826, 95% CI 0.802-0.878).\nDifferent domains of sexual function are severely impaired in men with SCI although their sexual interest remains high. The MSQ and SHIM scores strongly correlate, but the MSQ provides a more comprehensive assessment of sexual dysfunction in male patients with SCI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005737","authors":["Eduardo de Paula Miranda","Cristiano Mendes Gomes","Jos\u00e9 de Bessa","Carmita Helena Najjar Abdo","Carlos Henrique Suzuki Bellucci","Jose Everton de Castro Filho","Fabr\u00edcio Leite de Carvalho","Daniel Rubio de Souza","Linamara Rizzo Battistella","M\u00e1rcia Scazufca","Homero Bruschini","Tarcisio E.P.
