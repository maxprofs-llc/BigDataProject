Normal and emphysematous male hamsters were randomized to receive either saline or methylprednisolone 0.2 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) for 9 months, with or without nandrolone decanoate 1 mg x kg(-1) x week(-1) i.m. during the final 3 months. Diaphragm contractile properties and myosin heavy chain composition were determined. Compared to control hamsters, the force generating capacity of isolated diaphragm strips decreased by approximately 12% in the emphysema group and by approximately 22% in the emphysema plus methylprednisolone group. Addition of nandrolone decanoate to the emphysema plus methylprednisolone hamsters significantly improved force generation. The atrophy of type IIa and IIx diaphragm fibres in the emphysema plus methylprednisolone group was completely reversed to the level of control hamsters by the addition of nandrolone decanoate. In conclusion, nandrolone decanoate in part reversed the loss in diaphragm force-generating capacity in emphysematous hamsters treated with methylprednisolone, and reversed type IIa and IIx fibre atrophy completely.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007384","authors":["van Balkom, R H","Dekhuijzen, P N","van der Heijden, H F","Folgering, H T","Fransen, J A","van Herwaarden, C L"],"first_seen_on":"2016-01-03T17:18:40+00:00","issns":["0903-1936"],"issue":"5","journal":"European Respiratory Journal","last_mentioned_on":1451841501,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/10414405\/"],"pmid":"10414405","pubdate":"1999-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Effects of anabolic steroids on diaphragm impairment induced by methylprednisolone in emphysematous hamsters.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-anabolic-steroids-diaphragm-impairment-induced-methylprednisolone-emphysematous-hamsters"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6900838,"mean":6.1934479863797,"rank":5912915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6900838,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300463,"mean":9.0584304704087,"rank":244440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300463,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2873,"mean":5.6719979108635,"rank":2539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2873,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":10.922934306569,"rank":119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/iceman_ex\/statuses\/683698928634691584","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4948343],"posted_on":"2016-01-03T17:18:21+00:00","author":{"name":"#hellomynameis Segun","url":"http:\/\/intensivecarenetwork.com\/about\/icn-uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/905470202221125632\/VKdm9Zd4_normal.jpg","description":"Husband to @monanniecupcake. #FOAMed\/#FOAMcc\/#FOAMus.
