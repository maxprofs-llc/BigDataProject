In our study on the Joseon Human Skeletal Series, we identified benign bone tumors in two skeletons (cases Nos. 75 and 96). Our radiological analyses showed both cases to be homogeneous sclerotic bone masses aligned with the cranial vault suture. In a subsequent series of differential diagnoses, we determined both cases to be osteoma, the most common bone-tumor type reported for archaeological samples. Our study is the osteoarchaeological basis for this, the first-ever report on benign bone neoplasm in a pre-modern East Asian population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbc9","authors":["Dong Hoon Shin","Chang Seok Oh","Yi-Suk Kim","Yusu Kim","Seung Whan Oh","Jun Bum Park","In Sun Lee","Myeung Ju Kim"],"doi":"10.5115\/acb.2015.48.3.213","first_seen_on":"2015-12-31T18:41:40+00:00","issns":["2093-3665"],"issue":"3","journal":"Anatomy & Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1451503692,"links":["https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/282344451_Bone_tumors_in_pre-modern_skulls_from_human_skeletal_series_of_Joseon_Dynasty"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Chang_Seok_Oh\/publication\/282344451_Bone_tumors_in_pre-modern_skulls_from_human_skeletal_series_of_Joseon_Dynasty\/links\/5613a36608aea34aa92a9fba.pdf","pmid":"26417482","pubdate":"2015-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Bone tumors in pre-modern skulls from human skeletal series of Joseon Dynasty","type":"article","volume":"48","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bone-tumors-premodern-skulls-human-skeletal-series-joseon-dynasty"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6892495,"mean":6.1874169550219,"rank":5904876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6892495,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300693,"mean":8.9614459047794,"rank":244397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300693,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":1.9812580645161,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":6.825,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Bone tumors in pre-modern skulls from human skeletal series of Joseon Dynasty","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1011392162216890&id=612587498764027","license":"public","citation_ids":[4941973],"posted_on":"2015-12-30T19:28:12+00:00","summary":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/282344451_Bone_tumors_in_pre-modern_skulls_from_human_skeletal_series_of_Joseon_Dynasty","author":{"name":"Polska Antropologia Fizyczna","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/612587498764027","facebook_wall_name":"Polska Antropologia Fizyczna","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/612587498764027\/picture","id_on_source":"612587498764027"}}]}}
