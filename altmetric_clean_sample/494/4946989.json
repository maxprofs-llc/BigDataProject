MicroRNAs (miR) have been known as important regulators for the tumorigenesis, progression, invasion and metastasis of various cancers. MiR-184 was found to be abnormally expressed in various cancers including glioma and oral carcinoma. The expression and functional role of miR-184 in PDAC, however, remains unclear. PDAC cell line PANC-1 was transfected with miR-184 inhibitor. Real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of miR-184 in untreated PANC-1, miR-184 inhibitor transfected PANC-1 and controlled normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line HPDE6c7. MTT assay was used to detect the effect of miR-184 on the proliferation of PANC-1 cells, while invasion assay and Western blotting were employed to describe the effect on cell invasion ability and expression of caspase-3, respectively. In PANC-1 cells, miR-184 was abundantly expressed. The transfection of inhibitor effectively suppressed the expression of miR-184, and further inhibited both cell proliferation and invasion abilities, in addition to the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic protein caspase 3 expression. The up-regulation of miR-184 in PDAC may facilitate the proliferation and invasion ability, and inhibit apoptosis of tumor cells, thus potentiating the occurrence and development of PDAC. MiR-184, therefore, is a potential molecular target for therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc2b","authors":["Li, He","Xiang, Heping","Ge, Weiwei","Wang, Hengtong","Wang, Tianpeng","Xiong, Maoming"],"first_seen_on":"2016-01-02T21:39:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1936-2625"],"issue":"10","journal":"International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1451770749,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26722418?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4680363","pmid":"26722418","pubdate":"2016-01-02T22:00:27+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Expression and functional perspectives of miR-184 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-functional-perspectives-mir184-pancreatic-ductal-adenocarcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6898737,"mean":6.192569736251,"rank":5143371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":987875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6898737,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300587,"mean":9.030739102952,"rank":205080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":56228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300587,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1228,"mean":0.98331703341483,"rank":429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1228,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285,"mean":0.66031690140845,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
