During the course of treatment, the emergence of a daptomycin (DAP)-resistant MRSA strain was confirmed; the minimum inhibitory concentration was 1 to 2 &mu;g\/mL for vancomycin and more than 1 &mu;g\/mL for DAP. Although the bacterial cell wall was not significantly thickened, an increased positive surface charge and single-nucleotide polymorphism within mprF have been confirmed in DAP-resistant strains. Still rare, but clinicians need to be cautious of the emergence of DAP-resistant MRSA during treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61c3cf058f6100077d5","authors":["Hagiya, Hideharu","Haruki,
