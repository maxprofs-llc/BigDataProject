DCX mutations usually cause anterior dominant lissencephaly in males and subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) in females. We used whole-exome sequencing to investigate causative gene variants in a large family with late-childhood-onset focal epilepsy and anterior dominant pachygyria without SBH in both genders. Two potential variants were found for the genes encoding DCX and beta tubulin isotype 1 (TUBB1). The novel DCX mutation (p.D90G, NP_000546.2) appeared to be a major causative variant, whereas the novel mutation of TUBB1 (p.R62fsX, NP_110400.1) was found only in patients with more-severe intellectual disability after gender matching. We report an unusual DCX-related disorder exhibiting familial pachygyria without SBH in both genders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002425","authors":["Kim, Young Ok","Nam, Tai-Seung","Park, Chungoo","Kim, Seul Kee","Yoon, Woong","Choi, Seok-Yong","Kim, Myeong-Kyu","Woo, Young Jong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.braindev.2015.12.005","first_seen_on":"2016-01-03T03:32:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0387-7604","1872-7131","03877604"],"issue":"6","journal":"Brain & Development","last_mentioned_on":1465320343,"links":["http:\/\/www.brainanddevelopment.com\/article\/S0387-7604(15)00259-4\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26743950?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0387760415002594&_version=1&md5=6f5bc1714b783aca1b342c99098ca63b"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.brainanddevelopment.com\/article\/S0387760415002594\/pdf","pmid":"26743950","pubdate":"2016-01-09T11:05:02+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","pediatrics"],"title":"Familial pachygyria in both genders related to a DCX mutation.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/familial-pachygyria-both-genders-related-dcx-mutation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7866440,"mean":6.6628832942016,"rank":3245461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4571365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7866440,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312679,"mean":9.2579818215542,"rank":111160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":198304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312679,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":605,"mean":2.1891059602649,"rank":220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":605,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":3.95,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
