Here for the first time we describe the clinical, neurophysiological and histopathological features, and phenotypic differences between these two DI-CMTC families. Twenty-one affected individuals from the US family and 27 from the Bulgarian family were evaluated. The mean age of onset in US subjects was 10.7\u00a0years in men and 7.3\u00a0years in women, while in the Bulgarian participants it was 18.2\u00a0years in men and 33.7\u00a0years in women. The course was slowly progressive. Extensor digitorum brevis atrophy was uniform. Atrophy and\/or weakness of upper and lower limb muscles were found in over 50\u00a0% of the subjects. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) were abnormal in all US adults and five of six children and all Bulgarian patients except one asymptomatic 25-year-old man. Median motor NCS were in the range of 29.5-45.6\u00a0m\/s in the US family and 24.7-57.8\u00a0m\/s in the Bulgarian family. Sural sensory nerve action potentials were absent in 14\/21 and 4\/12 NCS from adult US and Bulgarian participants, respectively. Analysis of sural nerve biopsies from US patients revealed age-dependent morphological changes of axonal degeneration, absence of onion bulbs, and <10\u00a0% fibers with segmental remyelination. Our findings provide further insights into the diagnosis and pathology of intermediate CMT. They also extend the phenotypic spectrum of peripheral neuropathies associated with aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase mutations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e77","authors":["Florian P.
