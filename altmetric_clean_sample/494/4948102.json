The occurrence of gigantism, dwarfism, gynandromorphs, missing legs, extra legs, and asymmetries is most often reported from lab-reared specimens, but has been observed in field-collected specimens. All morphologically anomalous ticks (besides gynandromorphy) described to date are from species other than Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae). Here we describe four teratological I. scapularis nymphs collected while dragging vegetation in Wisconsin in 2015, including two asymmetrical ticks, one with a missing leg, and one with an extra leg.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006651","authors":["Larson, Scott R","Paskewitz, Susan M"],"doi":"10.1093\/jme\/tjv198","first_seen_on":"2016-01-03T14:03:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-2585"],"journal":"Journal of Medical Entomology","last_mentioned_on":1451837797,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26681790"],"pmid":"26681790","pubdate":"2015-12-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Teratological Nymphal Ixodes scapularis (Acari: Ixodidae) From Wisconsin.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/teratological-nymphal-ixodes-scapularis-acari-ixodidae-wisconsin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6900838,"mean":6.1934479863797,"rank":3383526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2013346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6900838,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300462,"mean":9.0584418144117,"rank":154399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":113260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300462,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":875,"mean":11.430100686499,"rank":588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":875,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":57.348787878788,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/desmoda1\/statuses\/683649795454558208","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4948102],"posted_on":"2016-01-03T14:03:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Des Moda","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/760461974572523520\/Fasnw4J6_normal.jpg","description":"Main interests:  INSTITUTE OF PARASITOLOGY  Biology Centre CAS,   Tick-borne microbes, Epidemiology.\nMy position: Observer\/Reader.","id_on_source":"desmoda1","tweeter_id":"2740120112","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":226},"tweet_id":"683649795454558208"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/WhatsLeftOfTheD\/statuses\/683683392874016769","license":"gnip","rt":["desmoda1"],"citation_ids":[4948102],"posted_on":"2016-01-03T16:16:37+00:00","author":{"name":"David Curtiss","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/842433518311366656\/k6tdDZs1_normal.jpg","description":"Patient Advocate for Tick Borne Disease.
