Clinical data and biological samples were collected before and 6 months after surgery.\nBefore surgery, interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were correlated with levels of high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) (p=0.006) and Helix-II (p=0.01), a biomarker of cartilage turnover, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) function score (p=0.03). Surgery resulted in substantial decrease in BMI (-20%). Levels of insulin and insulin resistance were decreased at 6 months. Knee pain decreased after surgery (24.5 \u00b1 21 mm vs 50 \u00b1 26.6 mm; p<0.001), and scores on all WOMAC subscales were improved. Levels of IL-6 (p<0.0001), hsCRP (p<0.0001), orosomucoid (p<0.0001) and fibrinogen (p=0.04) were decreased after surgery. Weight loss resulted in a significant increase in N-terminal propeptide of type IIA collagen levels (+32%; p=0.002), a biomarker of cartilage synthesis, and a significant decrease in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) (-36%; p<0.001), a biomarker of cartilage degradation. Changes in COMP concentration were correlated with changes in insulin levels (p=0.02) and insulin resistance (p=0.05).\nMassive weight loss improves pain and function and decreases low-grade inflammation. Change in levels of joint biomarkers with weight loss suggests a structural effect on cartilage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a32","authors":["Pascal Richette","Christine Poitou","Patrick Garnero","Eric Vicaut","Jean-Luc Bouillot","Jean-Marc Lacorte","Arnaud Basdevant","Karine Cl\u00e9ment","Thomas Bardin","Xavier Chevalier"],"doi":"10.1136\/ard.2010.134015","first_seen_on":"2016-01-04T06:32:34+00:00","issns":["1468-2060"],"issue":"1","journal":"Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1451782833,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/ard.2010.134015"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ard.bmj.com\/content\/70\/1\/139.full.pdf","pmid":"20980288","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Benefits of massive weight loss on symptoms, systemic inflammation and cartilage turnover in obese patients with knee osteoarthritis","type":"article","volume":"70","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/benefits-massive-weight-loss-symptoms-systemic-inflammation-cartilage-turnover-obese-patients-knee-o"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6900838,"mean":6.1934479863797,"rank":640068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":6233966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6900838,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301069,"mean":9.0704748628215,"rank":38146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":261831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301069,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2739,"mean":7.1010598977356,"rank":467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":2257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2739,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":10.822298850575,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
