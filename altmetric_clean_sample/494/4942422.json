Seventy-eight participants were randomly placed into three groups: the real acupuncture group (RAG); the sham acupuncture group (SAG); and the control group, with 26 participants per group. Data were collected preintervention, 15\u00a0minutes into acupuncture stimulation, postintervention, and 15\u00a0minutes after intervention. Changes (postintervention\u00a0-\u00a0preintervention scores) in the SBP, HR, and RPP were statistically lower in the RAG than in the SAG. Changes in the DBP showed a significant difference between the SAG and the RAG (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Findings from this study showed that among apparently healthy Nigerian adults, acupuncture needle stimulation at acupoints relevant to cardiovascular disorders was more effective than sham intervention in reducing the SBP, HR, and RPP. Participants reported heaviness, numbness, and increasing pain, but no dizziness, fainting and\/or life-threatening side effects, during and after the acupuncture needle stimulation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b3c","authors":["Sokunbi, Ganiyu","Maduagwu, Stanley","Jaiyeola, Olabode","Gambo, Hassan","Blasu, Cephas"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jams.2015.12.002","first_seen_on":"2016-01-01T00:07:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2005-2901","2093-8152"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Acupuncture and Meridian Studies","last_mentioned_on":1451606841,"links":["http:\/\/www.jams-kpi.com\/article\/S2005-2901(15)00241-1\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jams-kpi.com\/article\/S2005290115002411\/pdf","pmid":"27342888","pubdate":"2016-06-28T22:02:57+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Cardiovascular Response to Manual Acupuncture Needle Stimulation among Apparently Healthy Nigerian Adults","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cardiovascular-response-manual-acupuncture-needle-stimulation-among-apparently-healthy-nigerian-adul"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6897266,"mean":6.1917907788066,"rank":3381390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2012424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6897266,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301369,"mean":8.9568442104004,"rank":154743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":113690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301369,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190,"mean":3.1308253968254,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.2333333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Business, Management and Accounting":2,"Linguistics":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SPAHerbal\/statuses\/682714694021414912","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4942422],"posted_on":"2016-01-01T00:07:21+00:00","author":{"name":"C.A.I.
