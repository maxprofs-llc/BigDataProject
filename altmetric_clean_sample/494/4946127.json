We investigated the effect of sidecut radius on biomechanical variables related to the mechanics of turning.\nDuring a field experiment, six European Cup level athletes skied on three different pairs of giant slalom (GS) skis varying in sidecut radii (30\u2005m, 35\u2005m and 40\u2005m). Using a video-based three-dimensional (3D) kinematic system, a 22-point body segment model of the athletes was reconstructed in 3D, and the variables ground reaction force, centre of mass (COM) speed, COM turn radius, ski turn radius, edge angle, fore\/aft position and skid angle were calculated.\nWhile steering out of the fall line after gate passage, ground reaction force significantly differed between the 30\u2005m and 40\u2005m skis and between the 35\u2005m and 40\u2005m skis. These differences were mainly explainable by larger COM turn radii when skiing on the 40\u2005m ski. During the same turn phase, significant differences in ski turn radius also were found, but there were no differences in edge angle, fore\/aft position and skid angle.\nThe sidecut-induced reduction in ground reaction force and the sidecut-induced increase in centre of mass and ski turn radius observed in this study provides indirect evidence of reduced self-steering of the ski. Self-steering plays a central role in the mechanism of anterior cruciate ligament rupture in alpine ski racing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002456","authors":["J\u00f6rg Sp\u00f6rri","Josef Kr\u00f6ll","Matthias Gilgien","Erich M\u00fcller","Sp\u00f6rri, J\u00f6rg","Kr\u00f6ll, Josef","Gilgien, Matthias","M\u00fcller, Erich"],"doi":"10.1136\/bjsports-2015-095737","endpage":"19","first_seen_on":"2016-01-02T13:35:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-0480","14730480","0306-3674"],"issue":"1","journal":"British Journal of Sports Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1475647150,"links":["http:\/\/bjsm.bmj.com\/content\/50\/1\/14.long?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/bjsm.bmj.com\/content\/50\/1\/14.full.pdf+html","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26702014","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/bjsports-2015-095737"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bjsm.bmj.com\/content\/50\/1\/14.full.pdf","pmid":"26702014","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and British Association of Sport and Exercise Medicine","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"14","subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Sidecut radius and the mechanics of turning\u2014equipment designed to reduce risk of severe traumatic knee injuries in alpine giant slalom ski racing","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sidecut-radius-mechanics-turningequipment-designed-reduce-risk-severe-traumatic-knee-injuries-alpine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7483631,"mean":6.488280441707,"rank":3017251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4419371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7483631,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":307982,"mean":9.2085070312777,"rank":108567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":196176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":307982,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3804,"mean":31.408659479358,"rank":2692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":1091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3804,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":54.591949152542,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
