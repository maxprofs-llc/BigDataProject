Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-14 is a type I transmembrane proteinase regulating pericellular proteolysis of the extracellular matrix and is essential for the activation of several MMPs and cytokines. However, the physiological functions of MMP-14 in liver development are unknown. Here we describe a functional role for MMP-14 in hepatic and biliary differentiation of mouse hepatoblasts. MMP-14 was upregulated in cells around the portal vein in perinatal stage liver. Formation of bile duct-like structures in MMP-14-deficient livers was significantly delayed compared with wild-type livers in vivo. In vitro biliary differentiation assays showed that formation of cholangiocytic cysts derived from MMP-14-deficient hepatoblasts was completely impaired, and that overexpression of MMP-14 in hepatoblasts promoted the formation of bile duct-like cysts. In contrast, the expression of molecules associated with metabolic functions in hepatocytes, including hepatic nuclear factor 4\u03b1 and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, were significantly increased in MMP-14-deficient livers. Expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases were significantly upregulated in MMP-14-deficient livers. We demonstrate that MMP-14-mediated signaling in fetal hepatic progenitor cells promotes biliary luminal formation around the portal vein and negatively controls the maturation of hepatocytes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Otani, Satoshi","Kakinuma, Sei","Kamiya, Akihide","Goto, Fumio","Kaneko, Shun","Miyoshi, Masato","Tsunoda, Tomoyuki","Asano, Yu","Kawai-Kitahata, Fukiko","Nitta, Sayuri","Nakata, Toru","Okamoto, Ryuichi","Itsui, Yasuhiro","Nakagawa, Mina","Azuma, Seishin","Asahina, Yasuhiro","Yamaguchi, Tomoyuki","Koshikawa, Naohiko","Seiki, Motoharu","Nakauchi, Hiromitsu","Watanabe, Mamoru"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2015.12.105","first_seen_on":"2016-01-03T12:05:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1090-2104"],"issue":"4","journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1451822645,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26724533?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26724533","pubdate":"2016-01-03T22:00:13+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Matrix Metalloproteinase-14 Mediates Formation of Bile Ducts and Hepatic Maturation of Fetal Hepatic Progenitor Cells.","type":"article","volume":"469","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/matrix-metalloproteinase14-mediates-formation-bile-ducts-hepatic-maturation-fetal-hepatic-progenitor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6900838,"mean":6.1934479863797,"rank":5912896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6900838,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300460,"mean":9.0584721575987,"rank":244424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300460,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7691,"mean":2.6915942782835,"rank":6560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7691,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264,"mean":1.3272927756654,"rank":158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
