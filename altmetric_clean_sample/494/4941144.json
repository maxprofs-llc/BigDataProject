BH4 deficiency is associated with numerous metabolic syndromes and neuropsychological disorders. The concentration of BH4 in mammals is maintained through a de novo synthesis pathway and a regeneration pathway. Previous studies showed that the de novo pathway of BH4 is similar between insects and mammals. However, knowledge about the regeneration pathway of BH4 (RPB) is very limited in insects. Several mutants in the silkworm Bombyx mori have been approved to be associated with BH4 deficiency, which are good models to research on the RPB in insects. In this study, homologous genes encoding two enzymes, pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) and dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) involving in RPB have been cloned and identified from B. mori. Enzymatic activity of DHPR was found in the fat body of wild type silkworm larvae. Together with the transcription profiles, it was indicated that BmPcd and BmDhpr might normally act in the RPB of B. mori and the expression of BmDhpr was activated in brain and sexual glands while BmPcd was expressed in a wider special pattern when the de novo pathway of BH4 was lacked in lemon. Biochemical analyses showed that the recombinant BmDHPR exhibited high enzymatic activity and more suitable parameters to the coenzyme of NADH in vitro. The results in this report give new information about the RPB in B. mori and help to better understand insect BH4 biosynthetic networks.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100025b4","authors":["Li, Wentian","Gong, Meixia","Shu, Rui","Li, Xin","Gao, Junshan","Meng, Yan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cbpb.2015.04.006","first_seen_on":"2015-12-31T11:51:34+00:00","issns":["1879-1107"],"journal":"Comparative Biochemistry & Physiology Part B","last_mentioned_on":1451562678,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25899859?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25899859","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Molecular and enzymatic characterization of two enzymes BmPCD and BmDHFR involving in the regeneration pathway of tetrahydrobiopterin from the silkworm Bombyx mori.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-enzymatic-characterization-two-enzymes-bmpcd-bmdhpr-involving-regeneration-pathway-tetrahy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6896042,"mean":6.1898417149761,"rank":3380621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2012041,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6896042,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300797,"mean":8.9633673519593,"rank":154465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":113434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300797,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208,"mean":1.8711304347826,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.3372,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lepido_papers\/statuses\/682529459757432834","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4941144],"posted_on":"2015-12-31T11:51:18+00:00","author":{"name":"lepidopapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/558930683972685824\/x5EhqwSQ_normal.jpeg","description":"Continuous feed for papers on Lepidoptera from PubMed.
