This study highlights the presence of stem cells in DF, their potential to adhere and differentiate into osteoblasts on different types of titanium surfaces.\nIsolated cells from the harvested DF tissue from impacted canine\/molars, expressed stem cells markers. Differentiation into bone cells was induced in presence or absence of BMP-2 and TGF\u03b21. The presence of growth factors until 28\u00a0days in medium maintained the cells in an earlier stage of differentiation with a lower level of specific bone proteins and a higher expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Influence of titanium implants with different bioactive coatings, hydroxyapatite (TiHA) and with silicatitanate (TiSiO2), and porous Ti6Al7Nb implants as control (TiCtrl), was studied in terms of cell adhesion and viability. Ti HA implants proved to be more favorable for adhesion and proliferation of DF stem cells in first days of cultivation. The influence of titanium coatings and osteogenic differentiation mediums with or without growth factors were evaluated. Additional BMP-2 in the medium did not allow DF stem cells to develop a more mature phenotype, leaving them in a pre-osteogenic stage. The best sustained mineralization process evaluated by immuno-cytochemical staining, scanning electron microscopy and Ca(2+) quantification was observed for TiHA implants with a higher expression of ALP, collagen and Ca(2+) deposition. Long term culturing (70\u00a0days) on titanium surfaces of DF stem cells in standard medium without soluble osteogenic inducers, indicated that HA coating is more favorable, with the acquisition of a more mature osteoblastic phenotype as shown by immunocytochemical staining. These findings demonstrated that even in absence of exogenous osteogenic factors, TiHA implants and in a lesser extent TiCtrl and TiSiO2 implants can induce and sustain osteogenic differentiation of DF stem cells, by their chemical and topographical properties.\nOur research demonstrated that DF stem cells have a spontaneous tendency for osteogenic differentiation and can be used for improving bone regeneration on titanium implants surfaces.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cc3cf058f6100004b3","authors":["Ondine Lucaciu","Ondine Lucaciu","Olga Sori\u0163\u0103u","Dan Gheban","Dan Rus Ciuca","Oana Virtic","Adriana Vulpoi","Noemi Dirzu","Radu C\u00e2mpian","Grigore B\u0103ciu\u0163","Catalin Popa","Simion Simon","Petru Berce","Mihaela B\u0103ciu\u0163","Bogdan Crisan"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12896-015-0229-6","first_seen_on":"2015-12-31T07:58:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1472-6750"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1451991992,"links":["http:\/\/bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12896-015-0229-6?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12896-015-0229-6?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12896-015-0229-6?site=http:\/\/bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC4697321","pmid":"26718927","pubdate":"2015-12-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Dental follicle stem cells in bone regeneration on titanium implants","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dental-follicle-stem-cells-bone-regeneration-titanium-implants-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6908690,"mean":6.2029462469629,"rank":2937927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":3942240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6908690,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301140,"mean":8.9742274165749,"rank":125721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":173304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301140,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":448,"mean":4.6627561521253,"rank":224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":448,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":3.0675,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
