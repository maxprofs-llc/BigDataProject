However, the role of miRNAs in antibacterial defence in fish has not been fully determined. Here, we identified that nine miRNAs are differentially expressed in kidney between susceptible and resistant grass carp strains. Analysis of spatial and temporal miRNA expression patterns suggests that cid-miRn-115 and miR-142a-3p are potential regulators of anti-bacterial activity. Overexpressing of cid-miRn-115 and miR-142a-3p results in a visible change in Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells immune effector activity. Bioinformatics analysis and overexpressing assay shows that cid-miRn-115 and miR-142a-3p directly regulate tlr5 expression. cid-miRn-115 and miR-142a-3p overexpressing leads to a significant decrease in tlr5 expression in CIK, thereby repressing its downstream genes, such as il-1\u03b2, il-8 and tnf-\u03b1. These findings provide a novel insight into the determination of anti-bacterial compounds in grass carp.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Xiao-Yan Xu","Yu-Bang Shen","Jian-Jun Fu","Hong-Yan Yu","Wen-Ji Huang","Li-Qun Lu","Jia-Le Li"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep18595","first_seen_on":"2016-01-04T11:13:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1451992984,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep18595?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26727169?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4698583","pmid":"26727169","pubdate":"2016-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural genetics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"miRNAs","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Bacterial infection","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"MicroRNA-induced negative regulation of TLR-5 in grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/micrornainduced-negative-regulation-tlr5-grass-carp-ctenopharyngodon-idella-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6908690,"mean":6.2029462469629,"rank":3388867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2014815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6908690,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301263,"mean":9.0778148256333,"rank":154872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":113498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301263,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24569,"mean":14.404007896451,"rank":14518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":7534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24569,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2676,"mean":16.781113271028,"rank":1581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":801,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2676,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
