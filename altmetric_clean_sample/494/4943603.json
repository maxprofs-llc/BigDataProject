However, little information is available on the behavior of radio-resistant APL in terms of gene expression profiles and intercellular communication. In this study, cDNA microarray and RT-PCR were used to analyze the intracellular genetic network and extracellular vesicles (EVs), respectively, in the established radio-resistant HL60 (Res-HL60) cell line. Significant changes in the expression of 7,309\u00a0known mRNAs were observed in Res-HL60 relative to control. In addition, 7\u00a0mRNAs were determined as targets because significant changes in the expression were observed using Ingenuity analysis software, confirming the quantitative RT-PCR. However, EVs from Res-HL60 cells did not include these target molecules. These results suggest that radio-resistant APL is regulated by the expression and suppression of specific molecules, and these molecules are not transferred between cells by EVs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000837e","authors":["Monzen, Satoru","Chiba, Mitsuru","Hosokawa, Yoichiro"],"doi":"10.3892\/or.2015.4471","first_seen_on":"2016-01-01T11:25:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-2431"],"issue":"2","journal":"Oncology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1451647534,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26718911?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26718911","pubdate":"2016-01-01T22:01:15+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Genetic network profiles associated with established resistance to ionizing radiation in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells and their extracellular vesicles.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-network-profiles-associated-established-resistance-ionizing-radiation-acute-promyelocytic-le"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6897266,"mean":6.1917907788066,"rank":5142381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":987721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6897266,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301368,"mean":8.9569364794418,"rank":205709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":56383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301368,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1414,"mean":1.6544486907289,"rank":619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1414,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129,"mean":0.54765625,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/bionet_papers\/statuses\/682885371810545665","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4943603],"posted_on":"2016-01-01T11:25:34+00:00","author":{"name":"BioNetPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/848204009055948801\/lkerJJYd_normal.jpg","description":"A feed for papers in network biology.","id_on_source":"bionet_papers","tweeter_id":"2384073290","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":74},"tweet_id":"682885371810545665"}]}}
