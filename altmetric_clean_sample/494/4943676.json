Moreover, PCC includes two different forms: extrahepatic (EH) PCC, which arises from the perihilar EH large ducts, and intrahepatic (IH) PCC, in which a significant liver mass invades the perihilar bile ducts. In this study, we investigated the molecular profile and molecular prognostic factors in EH-PCC, IH-PCC, and ICC submitted to curative surgery.\nNinety-one patients with cholangiocarcinoma (38 EH-PCC, 18 IH-PCC, and 35 ICC), who underwent curative surgery in a single tertiary hepatobiliary surgery referral center were assessed for mutational status in 56 cancer-related genes.\nThe most frequently mutated genes in EH-PCC were KRAS (47.4\u00a0%), TP53 (23.7\u00a0%) and ARID1A (15.8\u00a0%); in IH-PCC were KRAS (22.2\u00a0%), PBRM1 (16.7\u00a0%), and PIK3CA (16.7\u00a0%); and in ICC were IDH1 (17.1\u00a0%), NRAS (17.1\u00a0%), and BAP1 (14.3\u00a0%). The presence of mutations in ALK, IDH1, and TP53 genes was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with EH-PCC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, p\u00a0=\u00a00.043, and p\u00a0=\u00a00.019, respectively). Mutation of the TP53 gene was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with IH-PCC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.049). The presence of mutations in ARID1A, PIK3C2G, STK11, TGFBR2, and TP53 genes was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with ICC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.012, p\u00a0=\u00a00.030, p\u00a0=\u00a00.030, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011, and p\u00a0=\u00a00.011, respectively).\nMutational gene profiling identified different gene mutations in EH-PCC, IH-PCC, and ICC. Moreover, our study reported specific prognostic genes that can identify patients with poor prognosis after curative surgery who may benefit from traditional or target adjuvant treatments.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a31","authors":["Ruzzenente, Andrea","Fassan, Matteo","Conci, Simone","Simbolo, Michele","Lawlor, Rita T","Pedrazzani, Corrado","Capelli, Paola","D'Onofrio, Mirko","Iacono, Calogero","Scarpa, Aldo","Guglielmi, Alfredo"],"doi":"10.1245\/s10434-015-5046-6","first_seen_on":"2016-01-01T11:48:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1534-4681"],"journal":"Annals of Surgical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1451742773,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26717940?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26717940\/?i=31&from=liver%20cancer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26717940\/?i=31&from=liver+cancer"],"pmid":"26717940","pubdate":"2016-01-01T22:02:05+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","generalsurgery"],"title":"Cholangiocarcinoma Heterogeneity Revealed by Multigene Mutational Profiling: Clinical and Prognostic Relevance in Surgically Resected Patients.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cholangiocarcinoma-heterogeneity-revealed-multigene-mutational-profiling-clinical-prognostic-relevan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6898737,"mean":6.192569736251,"rank":5143361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":987909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6898737,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301419,"mean":8.9580221353733,"rank":205779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":56313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301419,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1725,"mean":4.5489593967517,"rank":1100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1725,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":7.251,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
