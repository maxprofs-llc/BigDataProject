Two phase III clinical trials (RTOG 9402 and EORTC 26951) proved favorable effects of radiotherapy (RT) with chemotherapy (procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine; PCV) in patients with AO carrying chromosomal mutation of co-deletion1p\/19q even if it was not the primary endpoint of these studies. We assessed 1p\/19q co-deletion as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for our patients with AO.\n1p\/19q co-deletion was assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization in tumor samples from 23 patients and correlated with progression-free (PFS) and overall (OS) survival for the entire cohort and for the subgroups of patients with different treatment (neurosurgery plus RT alone vs. RT plus PCV).\n1p\/19q co-deletion was identified in 12 out of 23 tumors (52.2%). Patients with co-deletion had longer OS (587 vs. 132 weeks, p=0.012) and a trend for longer PFS (321 vs. 43 weeks, p=0.075). Patients with co-deletion treated with neurosurgery and RT plus PCV vs. neurosurgery and RT alone also had longer OS (706 vs. 423 weeks, p=0.008). There was no survival difference for patients without 1p\/19q co-deletion in relation to treatment.\nThe prognostic value of 1p\/19q co-deletion in our patients with AO was verified. The strong positive predictive value of this biomarker for OS was also shown for patients with co-deletion treated with neurosurgery and RT plus PCV vs. neurosurgery and RT alone.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a66","authors":["Polivka, Jiri","Repik, Tomas","Rohan, Vladimir","Hes, Ondrej","Topolcan, Ondrej"],"first_seen_on":"2016-01-03T11:03:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-7530"],"issue":"1","journal":"Anticancer Research: International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1467491199,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26722084?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26722084"],"pmid":"26722084","pubdate":"2016-01-03T22:01:07+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Co-deletion of 1p\/19q as Prognostic and Predictive Biomarker for Patients in West Bohemia with Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma.","type":"article","volume":"36"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7976486,"mean":6.7343932358615,"rank":3956510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3816278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7976486,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314232,"mean":9.2674609252426,"rank":150307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":151761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314232,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1715,"mean":3.6036277712952,"rank":520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":1129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1715,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":1.7143611111111,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lolitsjournals\/statuses\/683584601655087104","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4947654],"posted_on":"2016-01-03T09:44:04+00:00","author":{"name":"lolitsjournals","url":"http:\/\/keeganmclean.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/652288661413695488\/TMbtKL-d_normal.jpg","description":"Current journals on all things Chiropractic.
