Three increasing dose-per-fraction schedules of 64.7Gy\/22fx, 58.08Gy\/16fx and 51.6Gy\/12fx were each designed to yield equivalent predicted late toxicity. Three quality of life (QoL) surveys were administered prior to treatment and annually upto 3years.\nBowel QoL data at 3years revealed no significant difference among regimens (p=0.469). Bowel QoL for all regimens declined transiently, largely recovering by three years, with only the 22 fraction decrement reaching significance. Bladder outcomes at 3years were comparable (p=0.343) although, for all patients combined, a significant decline was observed from the baseline (p=0.008). Spitzer quality of life data revealed similarly excellent, 3-year means (p=0.188). International erectile function data also revealed no significant differences at 3years although all measures except intercourse satisfaction worsened post-treatment.\nThree-year QoL changes for bowel, bladder and SQLI were modest and similar for 3 HPFX regimens spanning 2.94-4.3Gy per fraction. These favorable patient-scored outcomes demonstrate the safety and tolerability of such regimens and may be leveraged to support further implementation of mild to moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy in the setting of low and intermediate-risk prostate cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003423","authors":["Brower, Jeffrey V","Forman, Jeffrey D","Kupelian, Patrick A","Petereit, Daniel G","Gondi, Vinai","Lawton, Colleen A","Anger, Nick","Saha, Sandeep","Chappell, Rick","Ritter, Mark A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.radonc.2015.12.018","first_seen_on":"2016-01-03T10:54:39+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["01678140","0167-8140","1879-0887"],"journal":"Radiotherapy & Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1451832423,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0167814015006799&_version=1&md5=1be35ee4558055d83ab01decb7e28a25","http:\/\/www.thegreenjournal.com\/article\/S0167-8140(15)00679-9\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26755165","pubdate":"2016-01-13T22:02:31+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","radiotherapy"],"title":"Quality of life outcomes from a dose-per-fraction escalation trial of hypofractionation in prostate cancer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quality-life-outcomes-doseperfraction-escalation-trial-hypofractionation-prostate-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6900838,"mean":6.1934479863797,"rank":4898325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1755701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6900838,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300460,"mean":9.0584919606334,"rank":187425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":95286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300460,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1832,"mean":1.473336974331,"rank":631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1832,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230,"mean":1.0112663755459,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":2},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":10}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/medphyspapers\/statuses\/683580968637186048","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4947643],"posted_on":"2016-01-03T09:29:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Med Phys Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"New publications in Medical Physics and Radiotherapy.","id_on_source":"medphyspapers","tweeter_id":"2879791906","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":136},"tweet_id":"683580968637186048"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pristinepeak\/statuses\/683660850322780161","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4947643],"posted_on":"2016-01-03T14:47:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Pristine Peak","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1203819152\/miniature-rose-1_normal.jpg","description":"Radoncologist by profession.
