PFOS causes liver damage (including liver tumors) in experimental animals, primarily via interaction with PPAR\u03b1 and CAR\/PXR. We investigated the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in PFOS-induced hepatotoxicity, and mechanisms involved in abnormal thyroid hormone (TH) homeostasis, in the livers of adult male rats exposed in feed to 50mg PFOS\/kg diet for 28 days. PFOS-treated rats exhibited expected histopathological and clinical chemistry changes, and global gene expression changes consistent with the involvement of PPAR\u03b1 and CAR\/PXR. Thirty-eight miRNAs were significantly altered. Three members of the miR-200 family were the most increased, while miR-122-5p and miR-21-5p were the most decreased, in PFOS-treated rats. Expression of the miR-23b-3p\/27b-3p\/24-3p cluster also decreased in PFOS-treated animals. Pathway analysis of miRNAs and associated gene expression changes suggests involvement of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is a primary process of tumor cell motility and cancer metastasis. Our analysis also revealed transcripts that may mediate PFOS-induced effects on TH homeostasis including: activation of the CAR\/PXR pathway, phase II\/III enzymes, and deiodinase. These changes are consistent with low serum TH due to enhanced metabolic clearance of TH. However, most TH hepatic target genes were not altered in a manner consistent with reduced TH signaling, suggesting that PFOS exposure did not induce functional hypothyroidism. Collectively, the study suggests an important role for miRNAs in PFOS-induced hepatotoxicity and provides insight into the effects of PFOS on TH homeostasis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f1","authors":["Dong, Hongyan","Curran, Ivan","Williams, Andrew","Bondy, Genevieve","Yauk, Carole L","Wade, Michael G"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.etap.2015.12.009","first_seen_on":"2016-01-03T12:30:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-7077"],"journal":"Environmental Toxicology & Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1451824203,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26724606?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26724606","pubdate":"2016-01-03T22:00:12+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Science And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","pharmacology"],"title":"Hepatic miRNA profiles and thyroid hormone homeostasis in rats exposed to dietary potassium perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS).","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hepatic-mirna-profiles-thyroid-hormone-homeostasis-rats-exposed-dietary-potassium-perfluorooctanesul"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6900838,"mean":6.1934479863797,"rank":5145129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":987947,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6900838,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300460,"mean":9.0584738217192,"rank":205167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":56035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300460,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":355,"mean":3.7498079096045,"rank":219,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":355,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":3.0343333333333,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
