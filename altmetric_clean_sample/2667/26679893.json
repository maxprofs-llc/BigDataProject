Secondary outcome: the composite of death, MI, stent thrombosis, stroke or urgent revascularisation and major or minor bleeding at 30 days.\nWomen were older, had higher TIMI risk score, longer prehospital delays and better TIMI flow in the infarct-related artery. Women had a threefold higher risk for all-cause mortality compared with men (5.7% vs 1.9%, HR 3.13, 95%\u2009CI 1.78 to 5.51). After adjustment, the difference was attenuated but remained statistically significant (HR 2.08, 95%\u2009CI 1.03 to 4.20). The incidence of major bleeding events was twofold to threefold higher in women compared with men. In the multivariable model, female gender was not an independent predictor of bleeding (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes major HR 1.45, 95%\u2009CI 0.73 to 2.86, TIMI major HR 1.28, 95%\u2009CI 0.47 to 3.48, Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 3-5\u2009HR 1.45, 95%\u2009CI 0.72 to 2.91). There was no interaction between gender and efficacy or safety of randomised treatment.\nIn patients with STEMI planned for PPCI and treated with modern antiplatelet therapy, female gender was an independent predictor of short-term mortality. In contrast, the higher incidence of bleeding complications in women could mainly be explained by older age and clustering of comorbidities.\nNCT01347580;Post-results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Dimitrios Venetsanos","Sofia Sederholm Lawesson","Joakim Alfredsson","Magnus Janzon","Angel Cequier","Mohamed Chettibi","Shaun G Goodman","Arnoud W van\u2019t Hof","Gilles Montalescot","Eva Swahn"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-015241","first_seen_on":"2017-09-28T05:29:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"9","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1506576530,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28939567?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28939567","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Association between gender and short-term outcome in patients with ST elevation myocardial infraction participating in the international, prospective, randomised Administration of Ticagrelor in the catheterisation Laboratory or in the Ambulance for New ST elevation myocardial Infarction to open the Coronary artery (ATLANTIC) trial: a prespecified analysis","type":"article","volume":"7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0.25,"6d":0.25,"5d":0.25,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":7311856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113799,"mean":11.509224942442,"rank":92463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113799,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6357,"mean":17.119186595343,"rank":5845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6357,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197,"mean":8.7090816326531,"rank":162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NWASLibrary\/statuses\/913274280590368768","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26679893],"posted_on":"2017-09-28T05:28:50+00:00","author":{"name":"NWASLibrary","url":"http:\/\/www.networks.nhs.uk\/nhs-networks\/nwas-library-and-information-service","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/602271582116061184\/FuIqklb6_normal.png","description":"North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust, Library & Knowledge Service [NWAS LKS].
