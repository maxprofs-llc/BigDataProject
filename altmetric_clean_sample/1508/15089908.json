While considered to have a substantial importance in, for example, providing conditions for single-cell rest and preventing long-term neural damage, a disturbance in this neurophysiologic phenomenon is a potential indicator of brain dysfunction.\nSince, in healthy individuals, slow waves can be induced with anesthetics, the authors tested the possible association between hypoxic brain injury and slow-wave activity in comatose postcardiac arrest patients (n = 10) using controlled propofol exposure. The slow-wave activity was determined by calculating the low-frequency (less than 1 Hz) power of the electroencephalograms recorded approximately 48\u2009h after cardiac arrest. To define the association between the slow waves and the potential brain injury, the patients' neurologic recovery was then followed up for 6 months.\nIn the patients with good neurologic outcome (n = 6), the low-frequency power of electroencephalogram representing the slow-wave activity was found to substantially increase (mean \u00b1 SD, 190\u2009\u00b1\u200983%) due to the administration of propofol. By contrast, the patients with poor neurologic outcome (n = 4) were unable to generate propofol-induced slow waves.\nIn this experimental pilot study, the comatose postcardiac arrest patients with poor neurologic outcome were unable to generate normal propofol-induced electroencephalographic slow-wave activity 48\u2009h after cardiac arrest. The finding might offer potential for developing a pharmacologic test for prognostication of brain injury by measuring the electroencephalographic response to propofol.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002255","authors":["Jukka Kortelainen","Eero V\u00e4yrynen","Usko Huuskonen","Jouko Laurila","Juha Koskenkari","Janne T.
