The objective of this paper is to describe the epidemiological, clinical and psychological features of a sample of patients with MCS for further specific group treatment.\nDescriptive study of patients diagnosed with MCS in a toxicology unit. We administered the Quick Environmental Exposure and Sensitivity Inventory, the structured interview SCID-II, the anxiety scale HAS and the type A personality test, PCTA.\nSeventy-three patients were included. The mean age was 52,6 years (range 33-77; SD 9.29). Sixty-six were females (90.4%). Fifty-three percent were classified as i-ii and ii grade. Sixty-one patients (83%) presented some type of comorbidity, mainly chronic pain, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. They exhibited higher levels of anxiety (average score of 19.2), prevalence of phobic-avoidant traits of personality and type A behavior in 31.1%.\nMCS affects middle-aged women with comorbidities (chronic pain, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue) and high anxiety and avoidance behaviors. This preliminary analysis should help provide a specific therapeutic approach to these patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008139","authors":["Lago Blanco, Eva","Puiguriguer Ferrando, Jordi","Rodr\u00edguez Enr\u00edquez, M\u00f3nica","Ag\u00fcero Gento, Laura","Salv\u00e0 Coll, Joan","Piz\u00e0 Portell, Maria Rosa"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.medcli.2015.09.016","first_seen_on":"2015-12-15T17:47:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0025-7753"],"issue":"3","journal":"Medicina Cl\u00ednica (ScienceDirect)","last_mentioned_on":1450201643,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26654553?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pmid":"26654553","pubdate":"2015-12-15T22:03:44+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Multiple chemical sensitivity: Clinical evaluation of the severity and psychopathological profile].","type":"article","volume":"146","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sensibilidad-qu%C3%ADmica-m%C3%BAltiple-evaluaci%C3%B3n-cl%C3%ADnica-la-gravedad-y-perfil-psicopatol%C3%B3gico"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6771968,"mean":6.1646290473641,"rank":5027825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":981527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6771968,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287505,"mean":8.6713095400411,"rank":194477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":55226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287505,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":750,"mean":2.1821094793057,"rank":417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":750,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.132,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
