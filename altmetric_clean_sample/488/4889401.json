Complications related to the BIFFF and traditional fibular free flap site of reconstruction were compared. Dental implant success rates for each type of flap were compared at 1-year intervals for 5 years.\nOne hundred fourteen patients underwent 81 BIFFFs and 35 traditional fibular free flaps. No significant difference in complications between BIFFF (20.9%) and traditional fibular free flap (25.7%) reconstruction was observed. Logistic regression analysis revealed only the site as a predictor of both single and multiple complications. At 5 years postimplantation, dental implant success rates were 95.5% and 77.1% for BIFFF and traditional fibular free flap, respectively (p = .006).\nBIFFF reconstruction is a novel surgical technique that may improve long-term dental implant success rates with no additional risk of complications. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
