Although these are separate developmental steps, evidence indicates that some of the signaling molecules that regulate these steps are shared. In this review, we focus on SYD-1, a RhoGAP-like protein that has been implicated in each step of axonal development. We discuss interactions between SYD-1, UNC-40(DCC) and RhoGTPases and highlight both similarities and differences in how SYD-1 functions to regulate the different steps of axonal development. These observations reveal an example of how a signaling protein can be repurposed across sequential developmental steps.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ec5","authors":["Xu, Yan","Quinn, Christopher C"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12035-015-9592-5","first_seen_on":"2015-12-15T19:44:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-1182"],"journal":"Molecular Neurobiology","last_mentioned_on":1450208646,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26660112?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26660112","pubdate":"2015-12-15T22:01:42+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","neurology"],"title":"SYD-1 Promotes Multiple Developmental Steps Leading to Neuronal Connectivity.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/syd1-promotes-multiple-developmental-steps-leading-neuronal-connectivity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6771968,"mean":6.1646290473641,"rank":3273268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1999232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6771968,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287505,"mean":8.6713008445099,"rank":145710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":110666,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287505,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1190,"mean":4.3268090832632,"rank":601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1190,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160,"mean":4.0469056603774,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
