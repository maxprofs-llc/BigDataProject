We summarize literature pertaining to skeletal muscle as a locus of fatigue and present our recent findings, utilising in vivo imaging in combination with biomechanical experimentation and modelling, to reveal novel structure-function relationships in CHF skeletal muscle and gait.\nWe propose the hypothesis that soleus function provides a surrogate for functional capacity and health status in chronic heart failure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073af","authors":["Green, Daniel J","Panizzolo, Fausto A","Lloyd, David G","Rubenson, Jonas","Maiorana, Andrew J","Daniel J.
