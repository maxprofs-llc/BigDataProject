Commonly reported AEs (\u22652% of all reported AEs) and serious AEs were determined. The incidence of reported seizures was determined and the events were further investigated.\nAmong the 107,000 patients exposed to dalfampridine-ER (70% female; mean age 52.1), the most common AEs were dizziness (3.7%), insomnia (3.2%), balance disorder (3%), fall (2.4%), headache (2.4%), nausea (2.1%), and urinary tract infection (2%). Other common AEs were drug ineffectiveness (5.8%), gait disturbance (4.6%), and inappropriate dosing (3.1%). Serious AEs included rare anaphylactic reactions (five cases) and drug hypersensitivity reactions (eight cases). A total of 657 seizure cases were reported (6.3\/1,000 patient-years); of these, 324 were medically confirmed (3.1\/1,000 patient-years). Incidence of reported seizures was stable over time. Duration of treatment prior to a seizure ranged from a single dose to >4 years; 12% of the seizures occurred within a week of starting treatment.\nThe 5-year US postmarketing safety data of dalfampridine-ER is consistent with the safety profile observed in clinical trials. Incidence of reported seizures remained stable over time. Since commercial availability in March 2010, a warning regarding the risk of anaphylaxis and severe allergic reactions was added to the US prescribing information.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc00","authors":["Michele Jara","Thomas Aquilina","Peter Aupperle","Adrian Rabinowicz","Jara, Michele","Aquilina, Thomas","Aupperle, Peter","Rabinowicz, Adrian L"],"doi":"10.2147\/dhps.s97113","first_seen_on":"2015-12-16T00:43:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1179-1365"],"journal":"Drug, Healthcare and Patient Safety","last_mentioned_on":1453359600,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/safety-profile-of-dalfampridine-extended-release-in-multiple-sclerosis-peer-reviewed-article-DHPS","https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=24972","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26719727?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26719727"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=28368","pmcid":"PMC4687626","pmid":"26719727","pubdate":"2015-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"169","title":"Safety profile of dalfampridine extended release in multiple sclerosis: 5-year postmarketing experience in the United States.","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/safety-profile-of-dalfampridine-extended-release-in-multiple-sclerosis-peer-reviewed-article-DHPS","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-profile-dalfampridine-extended-release-multiple-sclerosis-5year-postmarketing-experience-unit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.054,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.054},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7003089,"mean":6.2578197435162,"rank":499070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":6504126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7003089,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291307,"mean":8.7515758755397,"rank":28671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":262635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291307,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":3.322425,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":9,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
