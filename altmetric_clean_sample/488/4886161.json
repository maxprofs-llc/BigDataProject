TED consists of two phases: active, and inactive. The active phase of TED is limited to a period of 12-18 months and is mainly managed medically with immunosuppression. The residual structural changes due to the resultant fibrosis are usually addressed with surgery, the mainstay of which is orbital decompression. These surgeries are performed during the inactive phase. The surgical rehabilitation of TED has evolved over the years: not only the surgical techniques, but also the concepts, and the surgical tools available. The indications for decompression surgery have also expanded in the recent past. This article discusses the technological and conceptual advances of minimally invasive surgery for TED that decrease complications and speed up recovery. Current surgical techniques offer predictable, consistent results with better esthetics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aaf","authors":["Naik","Milind Neilkant Naik","Akshay Gopinathan Nair","Adit Gupta","Saurabh Kamal"],"doi":"10.4103\/0301-4738.171967","first_seen_on":"2015-12-17T00:30:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1998-3689"],"issue":"11","journal":"Indian Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1450312165,"links":["http:\/\/www.ijo.in\/text.asp?2015\/63\/11\/847\/171967"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijo.in\/article.asp?issn=0301-4738;year=2015;volume=63;issue=11;spage=847;epage=853;aulast=Naik;type=2","pmid":"26669337","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Minimally invasive surgery for thyroid eye disease","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/minimally-invasive-surgery-thyroid-eye-disease-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6787729,"mean":6.1724472011828,"rank":5804931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6787729,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274115,"mean":8.7776982131521,"rank":221828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274115,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":612,"mean":0.93870703764321,"rank":234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":612,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":0.89189189189189,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eyecenterllc\/statuses\/677284429505654785","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4886161],"posted_on":"2015-12-17T00:29:25+00:00","author":{"name":"Eye Center","url":"http:\/\/eyecenterllc.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/355341300\/apple-touch-icon_normal.png","description":"Ophthalmologists - Eye Physicians and Surgeons.
