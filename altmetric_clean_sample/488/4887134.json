Studies performed over the last 20 years have identified inflammation as the most important link between these two diseases. During the development of obesity, there is activation of subclinical inflammatory activity in tissues involved in metabolism and energy homeostasis. Intracellular serine\/threonine kinases activated in response to inflammatory factors can catalyse the inhibitory phosphorylation of key proteins of the insulin-signalling pathway, leading to insulin resistance. Moreover, during the progression of obesity and insulin resistance, the pancreatic islets are also affected by inflammation, contributing to \u03b2-cell failure and leading to the onset of type 2 diabetes. In this review, we will present the main mechanisms involved in the activation of obesity-associated metabolic inflammation and discuss potential therapeutic opportunities that can be developed to treat obesity-associated metabolic diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002832","authors":["Andressa  Coope","Adriana S Torsoni","Licio  Velloso","Coope, Andressa","Torsoni, Adriana S","Velloso, Licio","Andressa Coope","Licio A Velloso"],"doi":"10.1530\/eje-15-1065","first_seen_on":"2015-12-17T06:12:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1479-683X","0804-4643"],"issue":"5","journal":"European Journal of Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1505456805,"links":["http:\/\/www.eje-online.org\/content\/early\/2015\/12\/08\/EJE-15-1065.long","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26646937","http:\/\/www.eje-online.org\/content\/174\/5\/R175.long","http:\/\/www.eje-online.org\/content\/174\/5\/R175"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.eje-online.org\/content\/early\/2015\/12\/08\/EJE-15-1065.full.pdf","pmid":"26646937","pubdate":"2015-12-21T22:13:05+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"MECHANISMS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY: Metabolic and inflammatory pathways on the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes","type":"article","volume":"174","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanisms-endocrinology-metabolic-inflammatory-pathways-pathogenesis-type-2-diabetes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":3555841,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4809225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":294157,"mean":9.1036733229984,"rank":102743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":188422,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":294157,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1541,"mean":4.3554051948052,"rank":673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1541,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":2.4583333333333,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AT":1,"CZ":1},"mendeley":{"PT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PancreaticCell\/statuses\/677370233003331584","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4887134],"posted_on":"2015-12-17T06:10:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Pancreatic Cell News","url":"http:\/\/www.pancreaticcellnews.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/748297284094304256\/Lh_zVFMn_normal.jpg","description":"The online resource for the pancreatic community.
