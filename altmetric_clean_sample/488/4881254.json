For the first 100 operated patients (high-dose group), enoxaparin was given at a dose of 40 mg twice daily, starting 1 day before the operation. The next 100 patients (intermediate-dose group) received 40 mg of enoxaparin twice daily, without the dose on the morning of the operation. The last 200 patients (low-dose group) received enoxaparin 40 mg once daily, starting 1 day before the operation and without the dose on the morning of the operation. The primary endpoints in this study were a major bleeding complication and a venous thromboembolism.\nThere were no thromboembolic complications in this study. The difference in bleeding complications between the high-dose group and low-dose group was -10.5% (95% CI from -18.1% to -3.0%), and the difference between high-dose group and intermediate-dose group was -9% (95% CI from -17.4% to -.6%). Age and preoperative weight had no effect on bleeding complications, but hypertension significantly increased the amount of bleeding complications (P = .01, 95% CI from 1.55% to 29.7%).\nThromboembolic complications are avoidable. Enoxaparin (40 mg) given once daily was the safest with regard to bleeding complications. High blood pressure elevates the risk for bleeding.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008a99","authors":["Javanainen, Mervi H","Scheinin, Tom","Mustonen, Harri","Leivonen, Marja"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.soard.2015.12.017","first_seen_on":"2015-12-15T22:28:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1550-7289","1878-7533"],"journal":"Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1450218475,"links":["http:\/\/www.soard.org\/article\/S1550-7289(15)01111-9\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.soard.org\/article\/S1550728915011119\/pdf","pmid":"27050402","pubdate":"2016-04-07T22:00:46+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"Retrospective Analysis of Three Different Antithrombotic Prophylaxis Regimens in Bariatric Surgery","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retrospective-analysis-3-different-antithrombotic-prophylaxis-regimens-bariatric-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6771968,"mean":6.1646290473641,"rank":3273270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1999228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6771968,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287506,"mean":8.6712684231578,"rank":145707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":110667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287506,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":602,"mean":2.4998169717138,"rank":193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":602,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":2.7258695652174,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
