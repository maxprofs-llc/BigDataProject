The mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction seem to evolve throughout kidney disease progression culminating in reduced L-arginine transport and impaired nitric oxide bioavailability in advanced disease. This review examines the hypothesis that aerobic exercise may reverse endothelial dysfunction by improving endothelial cell L-arginine uptake in CKD.\nExercise reverses impairments in endothelial L-arginine transport and improves endothelial function in chronic kidney disease by increasing nitric oxide bioavailability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073af","authors":["Martens, Christopher R","Kirkman, Danielle L","Edwards, David G"],"doi":"10.1249\/jes.0000000000000065","first_seen_on":"2015-12-17T02:13:22+00:00","funders":["nhlbi","nigms"],"issns":["1538-3008","0091-6331"],"issue":"1","journal":"Exercise and Sport Sciences Review","last_mentioned_on":1458060025,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/acsm-essr\/Abstract\/2016\/01000\/The_Vascular_Endothelium_in_Chronic_Kidney.5.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/acsm-essr\/Fulltext\/2016\/01000\/The_Vascular_Endothelium_in_Chronic_Kidney.5.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/acsm-essr\/2016\/01000\/The_Vascular_Endothelium_in_Chronic_Kidney.5.pdf","pmid":"26509484","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"12","subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"The Vascular Endothelium in Chronic Kidney Disease: A Novel Target for Aerobic Exercise","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vascular-endothelium-chronic-kidney-disease-novel-target-aerobic-exercise-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7396084,"mean":6.428716941112,"rank":1239657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6151753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7396084,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281478,"mean":8.9566399172933,"rank":57471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":223725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281478,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":378,"mean":10.111485411141,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":378,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":9.3222222222222,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
