Herein, we describe chemoselective labeling of 5-formylpyrimidine nucleotides in DNA and RNA by fluorogenic aldol-type condensation reactions with 2,3,3-trimethylindole derivatives. Mild and specific reaction conditions were developed for 5fU and 5fC to produce hemicyanine-like chromophores with distinct photophysical properties. Residue-specific detection was established by fluorescence readout as well as primer-extension assays. The reactions were optimized on DNA oligonucleotides and were equally suitable for the modification of 5fU- and 5fC-modified RNA. This direct labeling approach of 5-formylpyrimidines is expected to help in elucidating the occurrence, enzymatic transformations, and functional roles of these epigenetic\/epitranscriptomic nucleobase modifications in DNA and RNA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Samanta, Biswajit","Seikowski, Jan","H\u00f6bartner, Claudia"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201508893","endpage":"1916","first_seen_on":"2015-12-17T13:56:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773"],"issue":"5","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
