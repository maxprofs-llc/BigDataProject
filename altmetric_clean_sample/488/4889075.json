These may help the clinician to anticipate individual patient's needs.\nSixty patients, who underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy under standardised general anaesthesia, were included. The total analgesic requirements during the first 48\u00a0h were the primary endpoint (unitary dosage, UD). The individual's attitude towards imaginary painful situations was measured with the Situational Pain Scale (SPS). The emotional status was assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the inflammatory status by the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR).\nUnivariate analyses revealed a significant association between UD and SPS, HADS and NLR. A negative relationship between SPS and NLR (NLR\u2009=\u20090.820-0.180*SPS;R(2)\u2009=\u20090.211;P\u2009<\u20090.001) and a positive relationship between SPS and HADS (HADS\u2009=\u200914.8\u2009+\u20091.63*SPS; R(2)\u2009=\u20090.159;P\u2009=\u20090.002) were observed. A multiple linear regression analysis showed that the contribution of NLR to the UD was the most effective. A mediation analysis showed a complete mediation of the effect of SPS on UD (R(2)\u2009=\u20090.103;P\u2009=\u20090.012), by the NLR (SPS on NLR: R(2)\u2009=\u20090.211;P\u2009=\u2009<0.001), the HADS (SPS on HADS: R(2)\u2009=\u20090.159;P\u2009=\u20090.002). The variance in UD explained by the SPS was indirect and amounts to 46\u00a0% through NLR and to 34\u00a0% through HADS.\nIn this series, preoperative pain-related attitudes (SPS) were associated with the postoperative analgesic requirements (UD) after a cholecystectomy. Eighty per cent of this effect was mediated by the HADS and the NLR.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a7","authors":["Myriam Daoudia","Myriam Daoudia","C\u00e9line Decruynaere","Bernard Le Polain de Waroux","Jean-Louis Thonnard","L\u00e9on Plaghki","Patrice Forget"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12871-015-0167-9","first_seen_on":"2015-12-17T13:32:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2253"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Anesthesiology","last_mentioned_on":1450904065,"links":["http:\/\/bmcanesthesiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12871-015-0167-9?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26674471?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26674471\/","http:\/\/bmcanesthesiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12871-015-0167-9","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26674471"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcanesthesiol.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12871-015-0167-9?site=http:\/\/bmcanesthesiol.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC4681155","pmid":"26674471","pubdate":"2015-12-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Anesthesiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Emergency Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Intensive \/ Critical Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","title":"Biological inflammatory markers mediate the effect of preoperative pain-related behaviours on postoperative analgesics requirements.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biological-inflammatory-markers-mediate-effect-preoperative-painrelated-behaviours-postoperative-ana"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6818838,"mean":6.1901666501164,"rank":2788531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":3961976,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6818838,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274855,"mean":8.7838829123824,"rank":107385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":162662,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274855,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":402,"mean":3.1033965087282,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":402,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.9413793103448,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
