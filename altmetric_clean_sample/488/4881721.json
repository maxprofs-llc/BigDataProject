These define distinct viral epigenotypes corresponding with latent viral gene expression profiles. Viral Latent Membrane Proteins 1 and 2A can induce cellular DNA methyltransferases, thereby influencing the methylation status of the viral and cellular genomes. Therefore, not only the viral genomes carry epigenetic modifications, but also the cellular genomes adopt major epigenetic alterations upon EBV infection. The distinct cellular epigenotypes of EBV-infected cells differ from the epigenotypes of their normal counterparts. In Burkitt lymphoma (BL), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and EBV-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC) significant changes in the host cell methylome with a strong tendency towards CpG island hypermethylation are observed. Hypermethylated genes unique for EBVaGC suggest the existence of an EBV-specific \"epigenetic signature\". Contrary to the primary malignancies carrying latent EBV genomes, lymphoblastoid cells (LCs) established by EBV infection of peripheral B cells in vitro are characterized by a massive genome-wide demethylation and a significant decrease and redistribution of heterochromatic histone marks. Establishing complete epigenomes of the diverse EBV-associated malignancies shall clarify their similarities and differences and further clarify the contribution of EBV to the pathogenesis, especially for the epithelial malignancies, NPC and EBVaGC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd24","authors":["Niller, Hans Helmut","Banati, Ferenc","Salamon, Daniel","Minarovits, Janos"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-3-319-24738-0_3","first_seen_on":"2015-12-16T01:13:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0065-2598"],"journal":"Advances in experimental medicine and biology","last_mentioned_on":1450279235,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26659263?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007\/978-3-319-24738-0_3"],"pmid":"26659263","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Molecular Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Virology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Epigenetic Alterations in Epstein-Barr Virus-Associated Diseases","type":"article","volume":"879","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epigenetic-alterations-epsteinbarr-virusassociated-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6777408,"mean":6.1700063558217,"rank":4787529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1745321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6777408,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287817,"mean":8.6899173708202,"rank":177308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":93070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287817,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1976,"mean":2.6518987341772,"rank":1095,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1976,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":509,"mean":2.1233070866142,"rank":239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":509,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1,"BE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/statuses\/676933079580192769","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4881721],"posted_on":"2015-12-16T01:13:17+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
