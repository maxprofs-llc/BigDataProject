We studied the effect of a single (50 microg\/kg\/i.m) dose of sarin (0.5 x LD50) on the mRNA expression of alpha tubulin in the central nervous system (CNS) of rats which were sacrificed at different time points i.e. 1 and 2 hrs, as well as, 1, 3 and 7 days post-treatment. Northern data collected from CNS regions indicate differential, spatial, and temporal regulation of alpha tubulin mRNA levels. Immediate induction and persistence of alpha tubulin transcripts in sarin-treated CNS suggest that sarin-induced neurotoxicity is in part mediated by the altered expression of cytoskeletal genes which may be regulated at multiple levels.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003191","authors":["Tirupapuliyur V Damodaran","Alicia A Mecklai","Mohamed B Abou-Donia","Damodaran, Tirupapuliyur V","Mecklai, Alicia A","Abou-Donia, Mohamed B","Tirupapuliyur V.
