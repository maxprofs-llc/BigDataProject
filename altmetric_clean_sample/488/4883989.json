Non-fatal firearm-related injuries were recorded during patients' initial emergency department visits.\nUnited States hospital emergency departments, 1993-2010.\n69 111 individuals admitted to US emergency departments after non-fatal firearm-related incidents.\nDemographic and incident characteristics of patients presenting with self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the foot.\nOf the 69 111 reported firearm-related injuries, 667 (1.0%) were self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the foot. Of these, 597 of the patients (89.6%) were men and 51.7% (345) were aged between 15 and 34 years. Patients generally presented with puncture wounds (265 patients, 39.7%), foreign bodies (164 patients, 24.6%) and bruised egos. Those who shot themselves in the foot were significantly more likely than individuals with other firearm-related injuries to be male (odds ratio [OR], 1.28) and married (OR, 2.6). As the festive season approached, the number of incidents increased; November and December were peak months for shooting oneself in the foot.\nThe nature of and the circumstances surrounding self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the foot were unique when compared with other firearm-related injuries. Through the large-scale examination of the characteristics of these incidents, trends in the nature of Americans shooting themselves in the foot have been elucidated. Young married men are at particular risk of shooting themselves in the foot. Particular caution must be taken during the festive season to avoid being caught under the missing toe.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008129","authors":["Cosco, Theodore D","King, James H"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-16T14:12:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1326-5377"],"issue":"11","journal":"Medical Journal of Australia","last_mentioned_on":1450406734,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26654620","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26654620?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26654620","pubdate":"2015-12-16T22:03:40+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Americans shooting themselves in the foot: the epidemiology of podiatric self-inflicted gunshot wounds in the United States.","type":"article","volume":"203","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/americans-shooting-themselves-foot-epidemiology-podiatric-selfinflicted-gunshot-wounds-united-states"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6790336,"mean":6.1741602613112,"rank":2867880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3767666,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6790336,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288037,"mean":8.6858437348109,"rank":119886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":158713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288037,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1278,"mean":9.082239624119,"rank":880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1278,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":22.707909090909,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
