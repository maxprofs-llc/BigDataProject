However, recent studies have revealed that these caspases have functions beyond their established roles. In addition to mediating cleavage of the inflammasome-associated cytokines interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and IL-18, inflammatory caspases modulate distinct forms of programmed cell death and coordinate cell-autonomous immunity and other fundamental cellular processes. Certain apoptotic caspases assemble structurally diverse and dynamic complexes that direct inflammasome and interferon responses to fine-tune inflammation. In this Review, we discuss the expanding and interconnected roles of caspases that highlight new aspects of this family of cysteine proteases in innate immunity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316b","authors":["Si Ming Man","Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti"],"doi":"10.1038\/nri.2015.7","first_seen_on":"2015-12-15T20:24:31+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","nci","niams"],"issns":["1474-1733","1474-1741"],"issue":"1","journal":"Nature Reviews Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1467132751,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/nri.2015.7.epdf?shared_access_token=G_WOhEqScQ6yxFrmk-19NtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PY5iwfRIJla3U7KQEx2hFUGY9hwmjLCYxC5yiauMnFg8YmRfpjO4dB4WU2RfsW6SDe2gfMUC7TiqxB1Mdu99tHqJHCQWmJUdWxYCcR-WbblVPIH7ku8o40AdVKdZ_KF3u1fqRC-UQhaQG0_XRX1v8K","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nri\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/nri.2015.7.html?WT.mc_id=FBK_NatureReviews","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nri.2015.7","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nri\/journal\/v16\/n1\/full\/nri.2015.7.html"],"pmid":"26655628","pubdate":"2015-12-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inflammation","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Inflammasome","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Innate immunity","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Pattern recognition receptors","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Cell death and immune response","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Converging roles of caspases in inflammasome activation, cell death and innate immunity","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/converging-roles-caspases-inflammasome-activation-cell-death-innate-immunity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7958342,"mean":6.7226589717569,"rank":1766568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6177305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7958342,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302713,"mean":8.9014595390997,"rank":77313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":224685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302713,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1233,"mean":7.6541477272727,"rank":570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1233,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":14.64362962963,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Ph.
