In this paper we discuss these issues with reference to rapid diagnostic tests for malaria. Strategies to control and eliminate malaria depend on early and accurate diagnosis. Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria require little training and equipment and can be performed by non-specialists in remote settings. Use of these tests has expanded significantly over the last few years, following recommendations to test all suspected malaria cases before treatment and the implementation of an evaluation programme to assess the performance of the malaria rapid diagnostic tests. Despite these gains, challenges exist that, if not addressed, could jeopardize the progress made to date. We discuss recent developments in rapid diagnostic tests for malaria, highlight some of the challenges and provide suggestions to address them.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000247a","authors":["Visser, Theodoor","Daily, Jennifer","Hotte, Nora","Dolkart, Caitlin","Cunningham, Jane","Yadav, Prashant","Theodoor Visser","Jennifer Daily","Nora Hotte","Caitlin Dolkart","Jane Cunningham","Prashant Yadav"],"doi":"10.2471\/blt.14.151167","first_seen_on":"2015-12-17T11:30:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1564-0604","0042-9686"],"issue":"12","journal":"Bulletin of the World Health Organization","last_mentioned_on":1450351656,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26668438?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.2471\/blt.14.151167"],"pmcid":"PMC4669726","pmid":"26668438","pubdate":"2015-12-17T22:01:28+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria.","type":"article","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tests-diagnostic-rapide-du-paludisme"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6787729,"mean":6.1724472011828,"rank":5804952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6787729,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274114,"mean":8.7777081641512,"rank":221836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274114,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":3.3490144927536,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.9375,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MalariaPapers\/statuses\/677450066068664320","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4888449],"posted_on":"2015-12-17T11:27:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Malaria Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/633328476070785024\/zGKHLt0g_normal.png","description":"I'm a bot tweeting papers about malaria as they appear on PubMed (& now preprints on BioRxiv). \n\nRun by @theosanderson.","id_on_source":"MalariaPapers","tweeter_id":"3428446343","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":136},"tweet_id":"677450066068664320"}]}}
