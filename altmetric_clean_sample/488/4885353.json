This December 2015 Issue of Cardiology in the Young features highlights of the two meetings that compose HeartWeek. Johns Hopkins All Children's Heart Institute's 15th Annual International Symposium on Congenital Heart Disease was held at the Renaissance Vinoy Resort & Golf Club, Saint Petersburg, Florida, from Friday, 6 February, 2015, to Monday, 9 February, 2015. This Symposium was co-sponsored by The American Association for Thoracic Surgery and its special focus was \"Congenital Abnormalities of the Coronary Arteries\". The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's annual meeting - Cardiology 2015, the 18th Annual Update on Paediatric and Congenital Cardiovascular Disease: \"Challenges and Dilemmas\" - was held at the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort and Spa at Gainey Ranch, Scottsdale, Arizona, from Wednesday, 11 February, 2015, to Sunday, 15 February, 2015. We would like to acknowledge the tremendous contributions made to paediatric and congenital cardiac care by Juan Valent\u00edn Comas, MD, PhD (13 May, 1960 to 16 June, 2015) and Donald Nixon Ross, FRCS (4 October, 1922 to 7 July, 2014); and therefore, we dedicate this December 2015 HeartWeek Issue of Cardiology in the Young to them.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024aa","authors":["Jeffrey P.\u00a0Jacobs"],"doi":"10.1017\/s1047951115002310","first_seen_on":"2015-12-16T19:24:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1467-1107"],"issue":"08","journal":"Cardiology in the Young","last_mentioned_on":1450300274,"links":["http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10070329&utm_source=Issue_Alert&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=CTY","http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10070329&fileId=S1047951115002310"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/article_S1047951115002310","pmid":"26675589","pubdate":"2015-12-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1441","subjects":["pediatrics","cardiology"],"title":"Introduction: December 2015 HeartWeek Issue of Cardiology in the Young \u2013 Highlights of HeartWeek 2015: Challenges and Dilemmas of Pediatric Cardiac Care including Heart Failure in Children and Congenital Abnormalities of the Coronary Arteries","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/introduction-december-2015-heartweek-issue-cardiology-young-highlights-heartweek-2015-challenges-dil"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6777408,"mean":6.1700063558217,"rank":2574340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4102025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6777408,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287817,"mean":8.6899078161047,"rank":102939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":179679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287817,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":583,"mean":0.88343642611684,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":583,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":0.57272727272727,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Psychology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Philosophy":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InCardiology\/statuses\/677207627097489408","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4885353],"posted_on":"2015-12-16T19:24:14+00:00","author":{"name":"India Cardiology 2.0","url":"http:\/\/cardiology.hcsm.in","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/888392364\/j0402858_normal.jpg","description":"Top News and Links For The Indian Cardiologist","id_on_source":"InCardiology","tweeter_id":"142214712","geo":{"lt":20,"ln":77,"country":"IN"},"followers":2499},"tweet_id":"677207627097489408"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CardioResearch\/statuses\/677207629312057344","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4885353],"posted_on":"2015-12-16T19:24:15+00:00","author":{"name":"cardio-research.com","url":"http:\/\/www.cardio-research.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1687818832\/with_website_normal.jpg","description":"http:\/\/t.co\/6HkOR9DFvf is an independent website with an aim to promote Basic Cardiovascular Research.","id_on_source":"CardioResearch","tweeter_id":"236133741","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5878},"tweet_id":"677207629312057344"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MyASNC\/statuses\/677234551924633600","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4885353],"posted_on":"2015-12-16T21:11:14+00:00","author":{"name":"ASNC Society","url":"http:\/\/www.asnc.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/649954672116146176\/37xfmL_d_normal.jpg","description":"The American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC) is the International leader in education, advocacy, and quality in cardiovascular imaging","id_on_source":"MyASNC","tweeter_id":"509110681","geo":{"lt":38.98067,"ln":-77.10026,"country":"US"},"followers":1697},"tweet_id":"677234551924633600"}]}}
