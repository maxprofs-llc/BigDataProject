In the first part of this article, I reflected on this practice and noted some of the difficulties in evaluating such a practice. In this second article, I ask whether the claim that this is an age-old or natural practice is useful, consider why this might be important for women and explore some of the issues that we might want to consider in relation to this and other practices for which we have no evidence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c46","authors":["Wickham, Sara"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-17T15:51:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1461-3123"],"issue":"10","journal":"Practising Midwife","last_mentioned_on":1450367470,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26669056"],"pmid":"26669056","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","obstetrics"],"title":"Pondering placentophagy.
