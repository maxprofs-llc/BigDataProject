Diabetes mellitus (DM) is frequently reported in this context and may play a role in the progression of the liver disease to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Renal disease is also an important extrahepatic manifestation of hepatitis viral infection and its presence is associated with poor prognosis and management issues. Objectives: Our study had multiple purposes: to determine the frequency of the association between chronic viral liver disease and diabetes mellitus, evaluate the potential of diabetes mellitus as a risk factor for HCC and assess an eventual renal involvement. Methods and results: We included in our study a number of 246 patients with chronic liver disease, from whom 136 were diagnosed with chronic viral hepatitis and 110 with viral liver cirrhosis. These patients were assessed by using a clinical examination and a series of tests, including serum transaminase levels, serum bilirubin, serum albumin, markers of cholestasis, fasting plasma glucose levels, serum creatinine, urea, albuminuria, Addis-Hamburger test, electrophoresis of urinary proteins, abdominal ultrasound and, in some cases, CT examination. We obtained the following results: diabetes mellitus is often associated with chronic liver disease of viral etiology, having been identified in 18.29% of the patients in our study. Age above 60 in patients with chronic hepatitis (p=0.013<0.05) and presence of hepatitis C virus were particularly correlated with the presence of diabetes mellitus. Renal disease was present in 13.4% of the patients with chronic liver disease and it was especially associated with liver cirrhosis and hepatitis C virus. The most common form of renal injury was glomerulonephritis. Acute kidney injury was diagnosed only in cirrhotic patients as hepatorenal syndrome, occurring in 7.27% of the subjects, while chronic kidney disease was identified only in two cases of chronic viral hepatitis. Four patients in our study were diagnosed with HCC and none of them presented diabetes mellitus. Discussion: Our study revealed that there is a significant association between diabetes mellitus and chronic viral liver disease induced by hepatitis C virus. Glomerulonephritis was the most common type of renal disease in both hepatitis patients and in those with cirrhosis. Glomerular injury was strongly correlated with the presence of hepatitis C virus than with hepatitis B virus. A connection between diabetes mellitus and hepatocellular carcinoma could not be established.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610004054","authors":["Iovanescu, V F","Streba, C T","Ionescu, M","Constantinescu, A F","Vere, C C","Rogoveanu, I","Mo\u021ba, E"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-16T00:32:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1844-3117"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Medicine & Life","last_mentioned_on":1450225911,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26664475?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC4656957","pmid":"26664475","pubdate":"2015-12-16T22:00:22+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Diabetes mellitus and renal involvement in chronic viral liver disease.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diabetes-mellitus-renal-involvement-chronic-viral-liver-disease-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6777408,"mean":6.1700063558217,"rank":5795197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6777408,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287817,"mean":8.689955242238,"rank":232576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287817,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":1.8435625,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.6375,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"PT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Diabetes_Wisdom\/statuses\/676922651395387392","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4881611],"posted_on":"2015-12-16T00:31:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Diabetes Wisdom","url":"http:\/\/organizedwisdom.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/618172370134691840\/ErA5denW_normal.png","description":"Organizing diabetes resources shared by health experts, advocates, and organizations.","id_on_source":"Diabetes_Wisdom","tweeter_id":"137902474","geo":{"lt":43.00035,"ln":-75.4999,"country":"US"},"followers":1710},"tweet_id":"676922651395387392"}]}}
