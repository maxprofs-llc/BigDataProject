The bandage of the future is here."],"citation":{"abstract":"The purpose of this study was to permit bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to reach their full potential in the treatment of chronic wounds. A biocompatible multifunctional crosslinker based temperature sensitive hydrogel was developed to deliver BMSCs, which improve the chronic inflammation microenvironments of wounds. A detailed in vitro investigation found that the hydrogel is suitable for BMSC encapsulation and can promote BMSC secretion of TGF-\u03b21 and bFGF. In vivo, full-thickness skin defects were made on the backs of db\/db mice to mimic diabetic ulcers. It was revealed that the hydrogel can inhibit pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage expression. After hydrogel association with BMSCs treated the wound, significantly greater wound contraction was observed in the hydrogel\u2009+\u2009BMSCs group. Histology and immunohistochemistry results confirmed that this treatment contributed to the rapid healing of diabetic skin wounds by promoting granulation tissue formation, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix secretion, wound contraction, and re-epithelialization. These results show that a hydrogel laden with BMSCs may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the management of diabetic ulcers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Shixuan Chen","Junbin Shi","Min Zhang","Yinghua Chen","Xueer Wang","Lei Zhang","Zhihui Tian","Yuan Yan","Qinglin Li","Wen Zhong","Malcolm Xing","Lu Zhang","Lin Zhang"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep18104","first_seen_on":"2015-12-16T20:37:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1450298264,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep18104"],"pmcid":"PMC4672289","pmid":"26643550","pubdate":"2015-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biopolymers in vivo","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cells","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Mesenchymal stem cell-laden anti-inflammatory hydrogel enhances diabetic wound healing","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mesenchymal-stem-cellladen-antiinflammatory-hydrogel-enhances-diabetic-wound-healing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6777408,"mean":6.1700063558217,"rank":5032244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":982235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6777408,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287817,"mean":8.6899112905467,"rank":194749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":55236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287817,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24104,"mean":14.221639298013,"rank":17796,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":3692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24104,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2376,"mean":15.619121684211,"rank":1781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2376,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
