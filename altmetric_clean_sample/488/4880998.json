Most of the existing methods analyze this decoding problem in a stochastic framework and use probabilistic metrics such as maximum-likelihood method to determine the parameters of the input signal assuming a leaky and integrate-and-fire (LIF) model. In this article, the input signal of the LIF model is considered as a combination of orthogonal basis functions. The coefficients of the basis functions are found by minimizing the norm of the observed spikes and those generated by the estimated signal. This approach gives rise to the deterministic reconstruction of the input signal and results in a simple matrix identity through which the coefficients of the basis functions and therefore the neuronal stimulus can be identified. The inherent noise of the neuron is considered as an additional factor in the membrane potential and is treated as the disturbance in the reconstruction algorithm. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by numerical simulations, and it is shown that input signals with different characteristics can be well recovered by this algorithm.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d7","authors":["Seydnejad, Saeid R"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00422-015-0671-5","first_seen_on":"2015-12-15T21:17:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0770"],"journal":"Biological Cybernetics","last_mentioned_on":1450214225,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26658736?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26658736","pubdate":"2015-12-15T22:02:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computer Appl. in Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Statistical Physics, Dynamical Systems and Complexity","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"subjects":["physiology","neurology"],"title":"Reconstruction of the input signal of the leaky integrate-and-fire neuronal model from its interspike intervals.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reconstruction-input-signal-leaky-integrateandfire-neuronal-model-interspike-intervals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6771968,"mean":6.1646290473641,"rank":3273270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1999232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6771968,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287505,"mean":8.6713011923312,"rank":145709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":110668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287505,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237,"mean":3.0527711864407,"rank":135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.4583333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
