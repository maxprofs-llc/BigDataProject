Although great advances have been made in the understanding and application of this therapy, significant complications still exist, warranting further investigation. Of critical importance, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), in both acute and chronic forms, remains a major complication of HSCT, responsible for both the development of chronic illness and morbidity, as well as mortality. The application of the appropriate preclinical model can provide significant insight into the mechanistic pathways leading to the development and progression of GVHD, as well as cancer in general. However, existing preclinical modeling systems exhibit significant limitations, and the development of models that can recapitulate the complex and comprehensive clinical scenario and provide a tool in which therapeutic intervention can be developed and assessed is of utmost importance. Here, we review the present status of the field of GVHD research. We discuss and summarize the preclinical models currently in use, as well as their advantages and limitations.
