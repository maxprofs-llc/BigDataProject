Roles of infant sex and maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) in these associations have not been studied.\nParticipants (N= 3310) in the Omega study, a cohort in Washington State (1996-2008), reported leisure time physical activity duration and energy expenditure in the year pre-pregnancy and in early pregnancy (mean 15 weeks gestation). Regression models estimated mean differences in infant head circumference, birth weight, and ponderal index(birthweight\/length) across quartiles of pre- or early pregnancy leisure time physical activity. We assessed effect modification by infant sex or pre-pregnancy overweight\/obese status (BMI\u226525 kg\/m).\nWe observed positive associations between pre-pregnancy leisure time physical activity and head circumference overall and among male infants. Among males, each quartile increase in pre-pregnancy physical activity duration was associated with 0.14cm (95% CI: 0.046-0.24; trend P=0.004) greater head circumference. We did not observe associations between leisure time physical activity and birth weight or ponderal index overall. Each quartile increase in pre- or early pregnancy physical activity duration was associated with 17-23g lower birth weight among female infants and among women with normal pre-pregnancy BMI.\nWe observed positive associations between pre-pregnancy leisure time physical activity and head circumference among male infants, and inverse associations of pre- and early pregnancy physical activity with birth weight among female infants and women with normal pre-pregnancy BMI. Future studies should confirm results and elucidate mechanisms of observed associations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f6100072c5","authors":["Badon, Sylvia E","Wander, Pandora L","Qiu, Chunfang","Miller, Raymond S","Williams, Michelle A","Enquobahrie, Daniel A"],"doi":"10.1097\/ede.0000000000000399","endpage":"81","first_seen_on":"2015-12-16T17:13:46+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["1531-5487","1044-3983"],"issue":"1","journal":"Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1474354329,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/epidem\/Abstract\/2016\/01000\/Maternal_Leisure_Time_Physical_Activity_and_Infant.12.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26427724\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/epidem\/2016\/01000\/Maternal_Leisure_Time_Physical_Activity_and_Infant.12.pdf","pmid":"26427724","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Statistics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"74","subjects":["epidemiology"],"title":"Maternal Leisure Time Physical Activity and Infant Birth Size","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/maternal-leisure-time-physical-activity-infant-birth-size-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":2077095,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6291995,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":308909,"mean":9.0124645784503,"rank":85741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":221768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":308909,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2308,"mean":9.060696142176,"rank":970,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":1330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2308,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":26.765542857143,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
