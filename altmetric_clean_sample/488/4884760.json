This study has assessed the possibility that the local angiotensin system promotes endothelial senescence in coronary artery endothelial cells and also the protective effect of the Crataegus extract WS1442, a quantified hawthorn extract. Serial passaging from P1 to P4 (replicative senescence) and treatment of P1 endothelial cells with the eNOS inhibitor L-NAME (premature senescence) promoted acquisition of markers of senescence, enhanced ROS formation, decreased eNOS expression, and upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and AT1 receptors. Increased SA-\u03b2-gal activity and the upregulation of ACE and AT1R in senescent cells were prevented by antioxidants, an ACE inhibitor, and by an AT1 receptor blocker. WS1442 prevented SA-\u03b2-gal activity, the downregulation of eNOS, and oxidative stress in P3 cells. These findings indicate that the impairment of eNOS-derived nitric oxide formation favors a pro-oxidant response triggering the local angiotensin system, which, in turn, promotes endothelial senescence. Such a sequence of events can be effectively inhibited by a standardized polyphenol-rich extract mainly by targeting the oxidative stress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fab","authors":["Sonia Khemais-Benkhiat","Noureddine Idris-Khodja","Thais Porto Ribeiro","Grazielle Caroline Silva","Malak Abbas","Marouane Kheloufi","Jung-Ok Lee","Florence Toti","Cyril Auger","Val\u00e9rie B.
