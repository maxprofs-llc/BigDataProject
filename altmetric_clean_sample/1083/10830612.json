However, electrospinning commonly produce two dimensional (2D) membranes, which limits the application of nanofibers for 3D tissue engineering scaffold. In this present study, a porous 3D scaffold (3DS-1) based on electrospun gelatin\/PLA nanofibers has been prepared for cartilage tissue regeneration. To further improve the repairing effect of cartilage, a modified scaffold (3DS-2) crosslinked with hyaluronic acid (HA) was also successful fabricated. The nanofibrous structure, water absorption, and compressive mechanical properties of 3D scaffold were studied. Chondrocytes were cultured on 3D scaffold and their viability and morphology were examined. 3D scaffolds were also subjected to an in vivo cartilage regeneration study on rabbit using an articular cartilage injury model. The results indicated that 3DS-1 and 3DS-2 exhibited superabsorbent property and excellent cytocompatibility. Both these two scaffolds present elastic property in wet state. In vivo study showed that 3DS-2 could enhance the repair of cartilage. The present 3D nanofibrous scaffold (3DS-2) would be promising for cartilage tissue engineering application.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Weiming Chen"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsami.6b06825","first_seen_on":"2016-08-25T19:10:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1944-8244","1944-8252"],"journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1473008502,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsami.6b06825","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsami.6b06825#.V79Br_k0aFo.twitter"],"pmid":"27559926","pubdate":"2016-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
