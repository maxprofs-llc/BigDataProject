Despite the highest rates in Europe, news reports from Britain and Germany have come under little scholarly scrutiny. In this article, we explore frames and their frequency of use in British and German online newspapers. Our findings reveal a dominant cross-national framing of obesity in terms of 'self-control', which places a more pronounced emphasis on individual responsibility than demonstrated by earlier studies and may contribute to a culture of weight bias and stigma. The results also reveal evidence for cross-national efforts to challenge this individualising framing with counter-frames of 'acceptance' and 'coming out'. We argue that this is a positive development, which demonstrates the potential of media frames to function not only as possible contributors to weight bias and stigma but also as mechanisms for countering entrenched social conceptions of obesity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5253cf058f610003d16","authors":["Dimitrinka Atanasova","Nelya Koteyko","Atanasova, Dimitrinka","Koteyko, Nelya"],"doi":"10.1177\/1363459316649764","first_seen_on":"2016-05-20T08:40:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1461-7196","1363-4593"],"journal":"Health (1949-4998)","last_mentioned_on":1473489000,"links":["http:\/\/hea.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/05\/19\/1363459316649764.full.pdf?ijkey=1AsUSqG0wihzPrM&keytype=finite","http:\/\/hea.sagepub.com\/cgi\/reprint\/1363459316649764v1?ijkey=RJNjBkARGxy5k&keytype=ref&siteid=sphea","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27207941"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hea.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/05\/19\/1363459316649764.full.pdf","pmid":"27207941","pubdate":"2016-05-22T22:00:32+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Obesity frames and counter-frames in British and German online newspapers","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/obesity-frames-counterframes-british-german-online-newspapers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":21.21,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":21.21},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":414635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7940475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273313,"mean":11.652164544549,"rank":21403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":251909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273313,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1704,"mean":2.2863100411039,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":1680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1704,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":7.3818181818182,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
