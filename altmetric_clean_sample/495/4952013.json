However, investigators do not have a complete control over panelists' intentional or unintentional consumption prior to a tasting session. Currently, it is unclear how prior consumption impacts the results of the tasting session. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of temporary and lingering mouth irritation caused by the consumption of coffee, orange juice, and gum within 1, 15, or 30 min prior to the tasting session on the perception of 4 basic tastes: sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. Fifty-two panelists were served a beverage (orange juice, coffee, and water) or were asked to chew a piece of gum, and then, remained in the waiting room for 1, 15, or 30 min. They were then asked to report taste intensities using 15-cm unstructured line scales. Mean intensities of all tastes were not significantly different when orange juice was a primer at 1, 15, and 30 min when compared to water. Mean intensities of bitter were significantly lower when coffee was a primer at 1, 15, and 30 min than when water was a primer. Mean intensities of sweet were significantly lower when gum was a primer at 1 and 15 min than when water was a primer. The findings showed that it is necessary for 30 min or more waiting period of no food or beverage consumption prior to sensory testing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fe9","authors":["Christina, Josephine","Palma\u2010Salgado, Sindy","Clark, Diana","Kahraman, Ozan","Lee, Soo\u2010Yeun","Palma-Salgado, Sindy","Lee, Soo-Yeun"],"doi":"10.1111\/1750-3841.13185","endpage":"S482","first_seen_on":"2016-01-04T23:28:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1750-3841"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Food Science","last_mentioned_on":1474380081,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/1750-3841.13185","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26709855\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1750-3841.13185\/pdf","pmid":"26709855","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"S477","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Impact of Prior Consumption on Sour, Sweet, Salty, and Bitter Tastes","type":"article","volume":"81","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-prior-consumption-sour-sweet-salty-bitter-tastes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":927614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7469341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320324,"mean":9.403120537707,"rank":44909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":274470,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320324,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1766,"mean":6.9884430594901,"rank":210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":1548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1766,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":10.169791044776,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Impact of Prior Consumption on Sour, Sweet, Salty, and Bitter Tastes","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=23982409845&p=1pl&v=1&x=J0b3F6y5C5jDLHMaGi8aNg","license":"public","citation_ids":[4952013],"posted_on":"2015-12-28T20:17:50+00:00","summary":"Abstract Food sensory tests generally require panelists to abstain from food or beverage consumption 30 min to an hour before a tasting session.","author":{"name":"Bionity","url":"http:\/\/www.bionity.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/914\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2016-02-02_at_15.18.55.png?1454426347"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ETCirulli\/statuses\/778232583670947840","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4952013],"posted_on":"2016-09-20T14:01:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Liz Cirulli","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/658779696293740544\/d3dtGd4P_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"ETCirulli","tweeter_id":"4049318903","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":47},"tweet_id":"778232583670947840"}]}}
