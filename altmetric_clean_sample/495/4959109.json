The periodontal pathogens with persistent inflammation lead to destruction of periodontium. In recent years, periodontal diseases have been associated with a number of systemic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular-disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic respiratory diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes including pre-term low-birth weight (PLBW) and pre-eclampsia. The factors like low socio-economic status, mother's age, race, multiple births, tobacco and drug-abuse may be found to increase risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. However, the same are less correlated with PLBW cases. Even the invasion of both aerobic and anerobic may lead to inflammation of gastrointestinal tract and vagina hence contributing to PLBW. The biological mechanism involved between PLBW and Maternal periodontitis is the translocation of chemical mediators of inflammation. Pre-eclampsia is one of the commonest cause of both maternal and fetal morbidity as it is characterized by hypertension and hyperprotenuria. Improving periodontal health before or during pregnancy may prevent or reduce the occurrences of these adverse pregnancy outcomes and, therefore, reduce the maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Hence, this article is an attempt to review the relationship between periodontal condition and altered pregnancy outcome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f6f","authors":["Parihar, Anuj Singh","Katoch, Vartika","Rajguru, Sneha A","Rajpoot, Nami","Singh, Pinojj","Wakhle, Sonal"],"first_seen_on":"2016-01-06T11:28:34+00:00","issns":["0976-7428"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of International Oral Health","last_mentioned_on":1452109179,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26229389?platform=hootsuite"],"pmid":"26229389","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Periodontal Disease: A Possible Risk-Factor for Adverse Pregnancy Outcome.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/periodontal-disease-possible-riskfactor-adverse-pregnancy-outcome-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6912770,"mean":6.208179930211,"rank":2451525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4437653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6912770,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302183,"mean":9.0653021821285,"rank":96348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":204413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302183,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":1.01,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
