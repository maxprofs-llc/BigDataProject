The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AMI samples compared with normal controls were identified. Functional enrichment analysis was then performed, followed by analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and transcription regulatory network (TRN).\nA total of 385 up- and 504 down-regulated DEGs were identified. They were mainly enriched in 5 pathways, such as Natural killer (NK) cell mediated cytotoxicity, and Chemokine signaling pathway. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) was hub protein in PPI network. Besides, 4 transcription factors (TFs), including nuclear receptor subfamily 2, group C, member 2 (NR2C2), MYC associated factor X (MAX), general transcription factor IIIC, polypeptide 2, beta 110 kDa (GTF3C2), and B-cell CLL\/lymphoma 3 (BCL3) were identified. Notably, nuclear receptor coactivator 7 (NCOA7) interacted with GTF3C2 and MAX directly.\nCCL5, BCL3, NR2C2, MAX, GTF3C2 and NCOA7 might play important roles in AMI development.
