Reliability (internal consistency and test-retest) was examined for 198 participants who completed the NMQ twice (with a 1 week interval). Construct validity was examined with data from 126 participants from the same population, who completed further four questionnaires related to the body regions described in the NMQ.\nThe internal consistency was excellent (Cronbach's alpha\u2009=\u20090.896). The test-retest reliability was examined with the prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) and all items showed moderate to almost perfect reliability (PABAK\u2009=\u20090.57-0.90). Participants with a musculoskeletal problem in a related region had significantly more disability\/pain, as assessed by the relevant questionnaires (p\u2009<\u20090.001), indicating that the NMQ had a good construct validity.\nThis study provided considerable evidence that the Turkish version of the NMQ has appropriate psychometric properties, including good test-retest reliability, internal consistency and construct validity. It can be used for screening and epidemiological investigations of musculoskeletal symptoms. Implications for Rehabilitation The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) can be used for the screening of musculoskeletal problems. The NMQ allows comparison of musculoskeletal problems in different body regions in epidemiological studies with large numbers of participants. The Turkish version of the NMQ can be used for rehabilitation due to its appropriate psychometric properties, including good test-retest reliability, internal consistency and construct validity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5233cf058f610003b92","authors":["Kahraman, Turhan","Gen\u00e7, Arzu","G\u00f6z, Evrim"],"doi":"10.3109\/09638288.2015.1114034","first_seen_on":"2016-01-05T11:44:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1464-5165"],"journal":"Disability & Rehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1451994245,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26726840?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26726840","pubdate":"2016-01-05T22:00:23+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire: cross-cultural adaptation into Turkish assessing its psychometric properties.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nordic-musculoskeletal-questionnaire-crosscultural-adaptation-turkish-assessing-psychometric-propert"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6908690,"mean":6.2029462469629,"rank":5151679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":988340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6908690,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301591,"mean":9.0710789482408,"rank":205960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":56180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301591,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1254,"mean":3.3042585794094,"rank":953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1254,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":4.3119142857143,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
