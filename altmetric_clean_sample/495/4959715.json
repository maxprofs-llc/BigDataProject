In particular, environmental species Burkholderia fungorum and Bradyrhizobium pachyrhizi colonized the duodenum of HIV patients who had abnormal blood CD4 T-cell counts but were absent in HIV-negative controls or HIV patients whose CD4 cell counts were normal. The two species coexisted and exhibited a decreasing trend proximally toward the stomach and esophagus and were virtually absent in the mouth. B. fungorum always outnumbered B. pachyrhizi in a ratio of approximately 15 to 1 regardless of the body sites (P\u200a<\u200a0.0001, r\u200a=\u200a0.965). Their abundance was inversely correlated with CD4 cell counts (P\u200a=\u200a0.004) but not viral load. Overgrowth of potential opportunistic pathogens for example, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, and Ralstonia and depletion of beneficial bacteria, for example, Lactobacillus was also observed in HIV patients.\nThe colonization of the duodenum by environmental bacteria reflects loss of colonization resistance in HIV infection. Their correlation with CD4 cell counts suggests that compromised immunity could be responsible for the observed invasion by exogenous microbes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006920","authors":["Yang, Liying","Poles, Michael A","Fisch, Gene S","Ma, Yingfei","Nossa, Carlos","Phelan, Joan A","Pei, Zhiheng"],"doi":"10.1097\/qad.0000000000000935","first_seen_on":"2016-01-06T13:16:43+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","nci"],"issns":["1473-5571"],"issue":"1","journal":"AIDS","last_mentioned_on":1452091725,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26731752?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26731752?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26731752","pubdate":"2016-01-06T22:00:06+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"HIV-induced immunosuppression is associated with colonization of the proximal gut by environmental bacteria.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hivinduced-immunosuppression-associated-colonization-proximal-gut-environmental-bacteria"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6912770,"mean":6.208179930211,"rank":2651677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4230220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6912770,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302182,"mean":9.0653020673038,"rank":108742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":191225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302182,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2444,"mean":4.175896029472,"rank":1338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1080,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2444,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":8.1310263157895,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
