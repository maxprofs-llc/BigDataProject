However, very little information about genetic association on TLR7\/8 and asthma are available.\u00a0This study aimed to evaluate the effects of polymorphisms in TLR7 and 8 on asthma risk and asthma-related phenotypes in a Chinese Han population. We enrolled 462 unrelated adult asthmatic patients and 398 healthy volunteers. The genotypes of tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR7 and 8 genes were determined using multiplex SNaPshot SNP genotyping assay.\u00a0We used case-control and case-only studies to assess any links with asthma and asthma-related phenotypes. There was no association between the variants in TLR7 and 8 and asthma susceptibility. However, our results revealed that the genetic variants in TLR7 and 8 were associated with asthma-related phenotypes, including eosinophil counts, serum immunoglobulin E levels, lung function, and asthma severity as well. Our study suggests that TLR7 and 8 polymorphisms may play a considerable role in the pathogenesis of asthma.\u00a0It will help in better understanding the pathogenesis of asthma and development of more effective strategies for asthma prevention, prediction, and therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f03","authors":["Zhang, Qian","Qian, Fen-Hong","Yin, Xiao-Wei","Cao, Qi","Bai, Jian-Ling","Du, Qiang","Shi, Yi"],"first_seen_on":"2016-01-05T12:19:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1735-1502"],"issue":"6","journal":"Iranian Journal of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1470248437,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26725554?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26725554","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Associations of Toll-like receptor 7 and 8 Polymorphisms with Asthma and Asthma-related Phenotypes in a Chinese Han Population.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/associations-tolllike-receptor-7-8-polymorphisms-asthma-asthmarelated-phenotypes-chinese-han-populat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":7063053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":317050,"mean":9.3928708243833,"rank":264671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":317050,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201,"mean":0.83304,"rank":97,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.13,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/asthma_papers\/statuses\/684348425609990145","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4954717],"posted_on":"2016-01-05T12:19:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Asthma Papers","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439482171208646656\/OWe4b0kE_normal.jpeg","description":"RSS feed for #asthma papers in #Pubmed.
