This only accounts for degenerative tendon tears. In traumatic tears, the subcoracoid space should be normal.\nThe CHD in patients with traumatic subscapularis tendon tears is larger than that in patients with degenerative tears and does not differ from patients with an intact subscapularis tendon.\nCohort study; Level of evidence, 3.\nA total of 83 patients with arthroscopically certified subscapularis tendon tears were included in the study. Forty-four patients had degenerative causes (group 1), and 39 had traumatic causes (group 2). The control group consisted of 20 patients with traumatic supraspinatus tendon tears and arthroscopically proven, intact subscapularis tendons (group 3). On preoperative axial magnetic resonance imaging, the distance between the CHD was measured, and the values of the 3 groups were compared using the t test.\nThe mean (\u00b1SD) CHD in patients with degenerative subscapularis tendon tears was 8.6 \u00b1 2.0 mm (range, 4.0-13.2 mm) and was significantly (P = .0003) smaller than that in patients with traumatic tears (10.2 \u00b1 2.0 mm; range, 6.6-16.2 mm) or controls (10.4 \u00b1 1.8 mm; range, 6.8-14.0 mm). The CHD of controls and patients with traumatic tears did not differ significantly (P = .7875). A CHD of less than 6 mm only occurred in patients with degenerative subscapularis tendon tears.\nThe hypothesis that the CHD in patients with degenerative subscapularis tendon tears is significantly smaller than that in patients with traumatic tears or intact subscapularis tendons was confirmed. The CHD in patients with traumatic tears does not differ from that in controls. A CHD of less than 6 mm only occurs in patients with degenerative subscapularis tendon tears.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221e","authors":["Maurice Balke","Marc Banerjee","Oliver Greshake","Juergen Hoeher","Bertil Bouillon","Dennis Liem"],"doi":"10.1177\/0363546515611653","endpage":"201","first_seen_on":"2016-01-04T22:20:47+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1552-3365"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Sports Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1457306317,"links":["http:\/\/ajs.sagepub.com\/content\/44\/1\/198.abstract?rss=1","http:\/\/ajs.sagepub.com\/content\/44\/1\/198.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajs.sagepub.com\/content\/44\/1\/198.full.pdf","pmid":"26564790","pubdate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"198","subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"The Coracohumeral Distance in Shoulders With Traumatic and Degenerative Subscapularis Tendon Tears","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coracohumeral-distance-shoulders-traumatic-degenerative-subscapularis-tendon-tears"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7356012,"mean":6.3919346534381,"rank":3233332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4050779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7356012,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":306453,"mean":9.2141927675458,"rank":124525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":176617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":306453,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2649,"mean":11.418622356495,"rank":1659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":947,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2649,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":17.737042735043,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
