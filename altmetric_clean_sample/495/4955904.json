Complement binding ability of de novo donor-specific antibodies (dnDSA) has been suggested as a prognostic tool to stratify patients for clinical risk. In this study, we analyzed posttransplant kinetics of complement-fixing dnDSA, and their role in antibody-mediated rejection development and graft loss. One-hundred and fourteen pediatric non-sensitized recipients of first kidney allograft were periodically monitored for dnDSA using flow-bead assays, followed by C3d and C1q assay in case of positivity. Thirty-nine patients developed dnDSA, that were C1q- and C3d-positive in 25 and 9 patients, respectively. At follow-up, progressive acquisition over time of dnDSA C1q- and C3d binding ability, within the same antigenic specificity, was observed, paralleled by mean fluorescence intensity increase, that correlated with clinical outcome. C3d-fixing dnDSA were better fit to stratify graft loss risk when the different dnDSA categories were evaluated in combined models, as the 10-year graft survival probability was lower in patients with C3d-binding dnDSA than in those without dnDSA or with C1q+\/C3d- or non-complement binding dnDSA (40% vs. 94%, 100%, and 100%, respectively). Based on kinetics profile, we favor dnDSA removal\/modulation at first confirmed positivity, with treatment intensification guided by dnDSA biologic characteristics.
