Here we focus on channels which mediate relatively high-rate ion and water flux and summarize the current knowledge in this field, focusing on targeting mechanisms, proteomics, electrophysiology and physiological function. In addition, since chloroplasts evolved from a cyanobacterial ancestor, we give an overview of the information available about cyanobacterial ion channels and discuss evolutionary origin of chloroplast channels. The recent molecular identification of some of these ion channels allowed to study their physiological functions using genetically modified Arabidopsis plants and cyanobacteria. The view is emerging that alteration of chloroplast and mitochondrial ion homeostasis leads to organelle dysfunction which in turn significantly affects energy metabolism of the whole organism. Clear-cut identification of genes encoding for channels in these organelles however remains a major challenge in this rapidly developing field. Multiple strategies including bioinformatics, cell biology, electrophysiology, use of organelle-targeted ion-sensitive probes, genetics and identification of signals eliciting specific ion fluxes across organelle membranes should provide in the future a better understanding of the physiological role of organellar channels and of their contribution to signaling pathways in plants.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422c","authors":["Carraretto, Luca","Teardo, Enrico","Checchetto, Vanessa","Finazzi, Giovanni","Uozumi, Nobuyuki","Szabo, Ildiko"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.molp.2015.12.004","first_seen_on":"2016-01-04T13:34:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1674-2052","1752-9867"],"journal":"Molecular Plant","last_mentioned_on":1451914467,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/molecular-plant\/abstract\/S1674-2052(15)00457-8"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S1674205215004578\/pdf","pmid":"26751960","pubdate":"2016-01-12T22:00:33+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","botany"],"title":"Ion channels in plant bioenergetic organelles chloroplast and mitochondria: from molecular identification to function","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ion-channels-plant-bioenergetic-organelles-chloroplasts-mitochondria-molecular-identification-functi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6905088,"mean":6.197633439229,"rank":3386220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2014246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6905088,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301208,"mean":9.0722762219999,"rank":154757,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":113543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301208,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":422,"mean":2.6596247030879,"rank":185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":422,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.7551724137931,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
