Treatment of psychiatric disorders should reduce the number of suicides. Higher psychiatrist-per--population ratio increases the opportunity for contact between the patient and psychiatrist. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the higher psychiatrist density (PD) is associated with lower suicide rates. The aim of this study is to examine the association between suicide rates and the PD in the European Union countries. These countries are economically and culturally connected and located on the same continent. This is an attempt to study a relatively homogenous sample.\nCorrelations were computed to examine relationships between age--standardized suicide rates in women and men, the PD, and the gross national income (GNI) per capita. Partial correlations were used to examine the relation between the PD and age-standardized suicide rates in women and men controlling for the GNI per capita.\nHigher suicide rates in women correlated with the higher PD. Controlling for the GNI per capita, the PD positively correlated with suicide rates both in women and in men. There was a trend toward a negative correlation between the GNI per capita and suicide rates in men. The PD was positively associated with the GNI per capita.\nProbably, higher suicide rates directly and\/or indirectly affect the decisions made by policy- and lawmakers regarding mental health services and how many psychiatrists need to be trained. The results of this study should be treated with caution because many confounding variables are not taken into account.","altmetric_jid":"52f8bc933cf058d4628b4570","authors":["Sher, Leo"],"doi":"10.3389\/fpubh.2015.00280","first_seen_on":"2016-01-06T11:35:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2296-2565"],"journal":"Frontiers in Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1452239942,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpubh.2015.00280\/abstract","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpubh.2015.00280\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpubh.2015.00280\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4701907","pmid":"26779474","pubdate":"2016-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Are Suicide Rates Related to the Psychiatrist Density?
