Various components of the MARS circuit remove both protein-bound and water-soluble molecules. Little is known about the extent of the enhanced clearance mechanisms used in MARS therapy on drug elimination. Of particular interest to acute care practitioners is the impact of MARS on antibiotic clearance, as suboptimal concentrations of such drugs can negatively impact patient outcomes. The properties of piperacillin\/tazobactam suggest that elimination may be enhanced in the setting of MARS therapy. We describe two cases in which this was studied. Piperacillin concentrations were determined at various points within the MARS circuit, and patient serum concentrations were reported throughout the dosing interval while receiving MARS therapy. Piperacillin concentrations in both cases were in excess of the desired goal minimum inhibitory concentrations for treatment of gram-negative infections. Use of an extended-infusion strategy of piperacillin\/tazobactam 3.375 or 4.5\u00a0g given every 8\u00a0hours maintained desired serum levels throughout the dosing interval. To our knowledge, this is the second published report on the use of piperacillin\/tazobactam during MARS therapy. These case reports reveal successful dosing strategies for patients requiring piperacillin\/tazobactam while receiving MARS therapy, as well as quantify the influence of individual MARS elements on drug extraction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032e5","authors":["Personett, Heather A","Larson, Scott L","Frazee, Erin N","Nyberg, Scott L","El-Zoghby, Ziad M"],"doi":"10.1002\/phar.1618","first_seen_on":"2016-01-05T12:51:24+00:00","issns":["1875-9114"],"issue":"8","journal":"Pharmacotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1451998265,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26289310?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26289310","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"Extracorporeal Elimination of Piperacillin\/Tazobactam during Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System Therapy.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extracorporeal-elimination-piperacillintazobactam-during-molecular-adsorbent-recirculating-system-th"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6908690,"mean":6.2029462469629,"rank":5920375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6908690,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301592,"mean":9.0710649522033,"rank":245423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301592,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":971,"mean":4.4985505154639,"rank":855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":971,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":18.5555625,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":4,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Environmental Science":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/684356443697381376","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4954831],"posted_on":"2016-01-05T12:51:05+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"684356443697381376"}]}}
