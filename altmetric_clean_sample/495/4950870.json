It remains unclear what is the optimal setting, dosage and combination of exercise and health promoting components that best facilitate patient adherence and symptom management in order to support cardio-respiratory fitness and lifestyle changes in an at-risk population of pre-illness physically inactive cancer patients.\nPatients with breast or colon cancer referred to adjuvant chemotherapy and by the oncologists pre-screening verified as physically inactive were eligible to enter a randomised three-armed feasibility study comparing a 12-week supervised hospital-based moderate to high intensity exercise intervention or alternate an instructive home-based12-week pedometer intervention, with usual care.\nUsing a recommendation based physical activity screening instrument in order to correspond with cardio-respiratory fitness (VO2 peak) proved to be an applicable method to identify pre-illness physically inactive breast and colon cancer patients. The study demonstrated convincing recruitment (67%), safety and intervention adherence among breast cancer patients; while the attendance rate for colon cancer patients was notably lower (33%). VO2-peak declined on average 12% across study groups from baseline to 12 weeks though indices towards sustaining watt performance and reduce fat mass favoured the hospital-based intervention. Pedometer use was well adapted in both breast and colon cancer patients.\nDespite a fair adherence and safety, the current study calls into question whether aerobic exercise, regardless of intensity, is able to increase VO2-peak during texane-based chemotherapy in combination with Neulasta in physically inactive breast cancer patients.\nISRCTN24901641.","altmetric_jid":"562656fa2a83eefb348b4569","authors":["Tom M\u00f8ller","Christian Lillelund","Christina Andersen","Kira Bloomquist","Karl Bang Christensen","Bent Ejlertsen","Lone N\u00f8rgaard","Liza Wiedenbein","Peter Oturai","Ulla Breitenstein","Lis Adamsen"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjsem-2015-000021","first_seen_on":"2016-01-04T17:04:17+00:00","issns":["2055-7647"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1452680505,"links":["http:\/\/m.bmjopensem.bmj.com\/content\/1\/1\/e000021.full?utm_source=Marketing_Email&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=20151212_BOSEM&utm_content&utm_term","http:\/\/bmjopensem.bmj.com\/content\/1\/1\/e000021.long","http:\/\/m.bmjopensem.bmj.com\/content\/1\/1\/e000021.full?utm_source=Marketing_Email&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=20151212_BOSEM&utm_content=&utm_term=","http:\/\/bmjopensem.bmj.com\/content\/1\/1\/e000021.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopensem.bmj.com\/content\/1\/1\/e000021.full.pdf","pmid":"27900123","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"The challenge of preserving cardiorespiratory fitness in physically inactive patients with colon or breast cancer during adjuvant chemotherapy: a randomised feasibility study","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/challenge-preserving-cardiorespiratory-fitness-physically-inactive-patients-colon-breast-cancer-duri"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6956879,"mean":6.2324552312088,"rank":1503814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5425884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6956879,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302141,"mean":9.0930312040773,"rank":79935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":221255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302141,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":16.81925,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":7.1833333333333,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
