However, as many as patient populations will have limited access to new direct acting antiviral regimens, patients and physicians are often faced with the challenge of selecting the best regimen available, as opposed to the optimal treatment. In this paper, the challenges and opportunities in developing a high cure regimen for different patient populations will be discussed and highlighted through case-based scenarios.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fe3cf058f61000302f","authors":["David R.
