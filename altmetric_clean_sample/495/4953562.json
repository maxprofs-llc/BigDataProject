However, the ranges of sedimentary fraction of total organic carbon (fTOC) and black carbon (fBC) were 0.82-2.26% and 0.04-0.5% respectively. Spatially, OCPs concentrations were higher at upstream sites as compared to downstream sites. Source diagnostic ratios indicated the technical usage of HCH (\u03b1-HCH\/\u03b3-HCH>4) and significant presence of DDT metabolites with fresh inputs into the Indus River as indicated by the ratios of (DDE+DDD)\/\u2211DDTs (0.27-0.96). The partitioning of OCPs between the sediments and water can be explained by two carbon Freundlich adsorption model which included both organic carbon and black carbon pools as partitioning media.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f6100065db","authors":["Ali, Usman","Bajwa, Anam","Iqbal Chaudhry, Muhammad Jamshed","Mahmood, Adeel","Syed, Jabir Hussain","Li, Jun","Zhang, Gan","Jones, Kevin C","Malik, Riffat Naseem"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ecoenv.2015.12.024","first_seen_on":"2016-01-05T08:16:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01476513","1090-2414"],"journal":"Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety","last_mentioned_on":1451983343,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0147651315302141&_version=1&md5=b07ce78175c90e4c22055bb898b17f41"],"pmid":"26761782","pubdate":"2016-01-14T22:00:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Significance of black carbon in the sediment\u2013water partitioning of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in the Indus River, Pakistan ","type":"article","volume":"126","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/significance-black-carbon-sedimentwater-partitioning-organochlorine-pesticides-ocps-indus-river-paki"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6908690,"mean":6.2029462469629,"rank":4904728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1757034,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6908690,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301591,"mean":9.0710550747702,"rank":188176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":95636,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301591,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":961,"mean":2.6602895833333,"rank":395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":961,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":0.75128421052632,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
