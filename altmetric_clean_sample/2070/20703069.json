FCM may transfer constituents to foods, not always detected by analytical chemistry, resulting in low but measurable human exposures. Testing FCM extracts with bioassays represents the biological response of a combination of substances, able to be released from the finished materials. Furthermore, this approach is particularly useful regarding the current risk assessment challenges with unpredicted\/unidentified non-intentionally added substances (NIAS) that can be leached from the FCM in the food. Bioassays applied to assess hazard of different FCM types are described for, to date, the toxicological endpoints able to be expressed at low levels; cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and endocrine disruption potential. The bioassay strengths and relative key points needed to correctly use and improve the performance of bioassays for an additional FCM risk assessment is developed. This review compiles studies showing that combining both chemical and toxicological analyses presents a very promising and pragmatic tool for identifying new undesirable NIAS (not predicted) which can represent a great part of the migrating substances and\/or \"cocktail effect\".","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f2","authors":["Isabelle Severin","Emilie Souton","Laurence Dahbi","Marie Christine Chagnon"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fct.2017.04.046","first_seen_on":"2017-05-30T16:28:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["02786915"],"journal":"Food & Chemical Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1496144702,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0278691517302259?sf80072082=1"],"pmid":"28476634","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Use of bioassays to assess hazard of food contact material extracts: State of the art","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bioassays-assess-hazard-food-contact-material-extracts-state-art"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":7168842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240040,"mean":12.029827053104,"rank":195183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240040,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2460,"mean":7.5128979259862,"rank":2081,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2460,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":3.2810666666667,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Use of bioassays to assess hazard of food contact material extracts: State of the art","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1591148054229163&id=604564832887495","license":"public","citation_ids":[20703069],"posted_on":"2017-05-30T11:45:02+00:00","summary":"This review focuses on the use of in vitro bioassays for the hazard assessment of food contact materials (FCM) as a relevant strategy, in complement to analytical methods. http:\/\/bit.ly\/2rQxTJI","author":{"name":"Elsevier Toxicology","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/604564832887495","facebook_wall_name":"Elsevier Toxicology","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/604564832887495\/picture","id_on_source":"604564832887495"}}]}}
