In this commentary, I question the ethical acceptability of the practice of providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) to dying patients who would be unlikely to survive resuscitation, as a teaching opportunity for medical trainees. This practice violates the principle of informed consent, as the patient agreed to resuscitation for the purpose of potentially prolonging life rather than to futile resuscitation as a teaching opportunity. Justifying futile resuscitation in order to practice normalizes deceptive and nonconsensual teaching cases in medical training. Condoning these behaviors as ethically acceptable trains physicians to believe that core ethical principles are relative and fluid to suit one's purpose. I argue that these practices are antithetical to the principles espoused by both medical ethics and physician professionalism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000248b","authors":["ELIZABETH DZENG"],"doi":"10.1017\/s096318011600116x","first_seen_on":"2017-05-30T22:51:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0963-1801","1469-2147"],"issue":"3","journal":"Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics","last_mentioned_on":1498163711,"links":["https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/journals\/cambridge-quarterly-of-healthcare-ethics\/article\/when-teachable-moments-become-ethically-problematic\/7B332411BDFA1BD5EFA6E749E4603CF8#.WS33CWkoD60.twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/services\/aop-cambridge-core\/content\/view\/7B332411BDFA1BD5EFA6E749E4603CF8\/S096318011600116Xa.pdf\/div-class-title-when-teachable-moments-become-ethically-problematic-div.pdf","pmid":"28541177","pubdate":"2017-05-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"subjects":["ethics"],"title":"When Teachable Moments Become Ethically Problematic","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/teachable-moments-become-ethically-problematic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":3.2,"6m":3.2,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":2117276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6274699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245358,"mean":12.559701186434,"rank":79848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":164620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245358,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232,"mean":4.4718354978355,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":4.2136363636364,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":2,"CA":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/silviacamporesi\/statuses\/869687643264733184","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20708461],"posted_on":"2017-05-30T22:51:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Silvia Camporesi","url":"https:\/\/silviacamporesiresearch.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/847386776066850817\/UGhxxsIf_normal.jpg","description":"One of the half million Italians of London.
