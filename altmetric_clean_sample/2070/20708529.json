Microenvironmental microRNAs (miRNAs) such as miRNA-146a and miRNA-150 regulate cancer-associated inflammation and are involved in HPV-induced carcinogenesis. We studied the effects of celecoxib on the expression of these two miRNAs in HPV16-induced lesions.\nFemale transgenic (HPV16(+\/-)) and wild-type (HPV16(-\/-)) mice were administered 75 mg\/kg\/day celecoxib orally (treatment groups) or placebo (control groups) for four weeks. Skin samples were classified histologically, or used for miRNA analysis by quantitative real-time PCR.\nHPV16(+\/-) mice showed higher miRNA-146a and miRNA-150 expression levels compared to wild-type animals. Celecoxib further increased miRNA-150 (p<0.05) and miRNA-146a levels in treated animals. Celecoxib-treated HPV16(+\/-) animals also showed reduced incidence of epidermal dysplasia and reduced inflammation, compared to untreated mice.\nIn this model, celecoxib may be able to regulate tumour-associated inflammation, through mechanisms involving the regulation of miRNA-146a and miRNA-150.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a66","authors":["DA Costa, Rui M Gil","Ara\u00fajo, Rita","Santos, Joana M O","Fernandes, Mara","Neto, Tiago","Sousa, Hugo","Ribeiro, Joana","Bastos, Margarida M S M","Oliveira, Paula A","Carmo, Diogo","Casaca, F\u00e1tima","Silva, Sandra","Lopes, Carlos","Medeiros, Rui"],"doi":"10.21873\/anticanres.11644","first_seen_on":"2017-05-30T22:56:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0250-7005","1791-7530"],"issue":"6","journal":"Anticancer Research: International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1496194649,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28551628?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28551628?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28551628","pubdate":"2017-05-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Institute of Anticancer Research","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Regulation of miRNA-146a and miRNA-150 Levels by Celecoxib in Premalignant Lesions of K14-HPV16 Mice","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regulation-mirna146a-mirna150-levels-celecoxib-premalignant-lesions-k14hpv16-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":6294830,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1122356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240378,"mean":12.039940609958,"rank":169448,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240378,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1769,"mean":3.7916504524887,"rank":888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1769,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":2.3032894736842,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
