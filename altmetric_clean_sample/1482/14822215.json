However, little is known about the anti-fibrotic factors secreted from MSCs or their mechanisms.\nUmbilical cord-derived MSCs (UCMSCs) were differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells (hpUCMSCs), medium was collected, and secretome proteins were identified and quantified using nanochip-liquid chromatography\/quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Liver fibrosis was induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of thioacetamide or CCl4; some mice were then given injections of secretomes or proteins. Liver tissues were collected and analyzed by histology or PCR array, to analyze changes in gene expression patterns. We analyzed the effects of MSC secretomes and potential anti-fibrotic proteins on transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1)-mediated activation of human hepatic stellate cell (HSC) lines (hTert-HSC and LX2) and human primary HSCs. Liver tissues were collected from 16 patients with liver cirrhosis and 16 individuals without cirrhosis (controls) in Korea and analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunoblots.\nIn mice with fibrosis, accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins was significantly reduced 3 days after injecting secretomes from UCMSCs, and to a greater extent from hpUCMSCs; numbers of activated HSCs that expressed the myogenic marker \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA, encoded by ACTA2: actin, alpha 2, smooth muscle) were also reduced. Secretomes from UCMSCs, and to a greater extent from hpUCMSCs, reduced liver expression of multiple fibrotic factors, collagens, metalloproteinases, TGFB, and Smad proteins in the TGFB signaling pathways. In HSC cell lines and primary HSCs, TGFB1-stimulated upregulation of \u03b1-SMA was significantly inhibited (and SMAD2 phosphorylation reduced) by secretomes from UCMSCs, and to a greater extent from hpUCMSCs. We identified 32 proteins in secretomes of UCMSCs that were more highly concentrated in secretomes from hpUCMSCs and inhibited TGFB-mediated activation of HSCs. One of these, milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFGE8), was a strong inhibitor of activation of human primary HSCs. We found MFGE8 to downregulate expression of TGFB type I receptor by binding to \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin on HSCs and to be secreted by MSCs from umbilical cord, teeth, and bone marrow. In mice, injection of recombinant human MFGE8 had anti-fibrotic effects comparable to those of the hpUCMSC secretome, reducing ECM deposition and HSC activation. Co-injection of an antibody against MFGE8 reduced the anti-fibrotic effects of the hpUCMSC secretome in mice. Levels of MFGE8 were reduced in cirrhotic liver tissue from patients compared to controls.\nMFGE8 is an anti-fibrotic protein in MSC secretomes that strongly inhibits TGFB signaling and reduces ECM deposition and liver fibrosis in mice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074fe","authors":["Su Yeon An","Yu Jin Jang","Hee-Joung Lim","Jiyou Han","Jaehun Lee","Gyunggyu Lee","Ji Young Park","Seo-Young Park","Ji Hyang Kim","Byung-Rok Do","Chugseong Han","Hee-Kyung Park","Ok-Hee Kim","Myeong Jun Song","Say-June Kim","Jong-Hoon Kim"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.gastro.2016.12.003","first_seen_on":"2016-12-17T12:50:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00165085","1528-0012"],"journal":"Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1481979015,"links":["http:\/\/www.gastrojournal.org\/article\/S0016-5085(16)35463-4\/abstract?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2F"],"pmid":"27956229","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Milk Fat Globule-EGF Factor 8, Secreted by Mesenchymal Stem Cells, Protects Against Liver Fibrosis in Mice","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/milk-fat-globuleegf-factor-8-secreted-mesenchymal-stem-cells-protects-against-liver-fibrosis-mice-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7902020,"mean":6.6891515940364,"rank":6841949,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7902020,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232761,"mean":12.585757733287,"rank":190256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232761,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4948,"mean":7.6526573681019,"rank":4496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4948,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":10.785517241379,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Ph.
