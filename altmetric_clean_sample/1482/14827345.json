This review aims to systematically investigate the scientific evidence supporting the hypothesis on the omega-3 PUFAs deficit as a risk factor shared by different pediatric neuropsychiatric disorders. Medline PubMed database was searched for studies examining blood docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) status in children with neuropsychiatric disorders. Forty-one published manuscripts were compatible with the search criteria. The majority of studies on attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism found a significant decrease in DHA levels in patients versus healthy controls. For the other conditions examined-depression, juvenile bipolar disorder, intellectual disabilities, learning difficulties, and eating disorders (EDs)-the literature was too limited to draw any stable conclusions. However, except EDs, findings in these conditions were in line with results from ADHD and autism studies. Results about EPA levels were too inconsistent to conclude that EPA could be associated with any of the conditions examined. Finally, correlational data provided, on one hand, evidence for a negative association between DHA and symptomatology, whereas on the other hand, evidence for a positive association between EPA and emotional well-being. Although the present review underlines the potential involvement of omega-3 PUFAs in the predisposition to childhood neuropsychiatric disorders, more observational and intervention studies across different diagnoses are needed, which should integrate the collection of baseline PUFA levels with their potential genetic and environmental influencing factors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002817","authors":["Alessandra Tesei","Alessandro Crippa","Silvia Busti Ceccarelli","Maddalena Mauri","Massimo Molteni","Carlo Agostoni","Maria Nobile","Tesei, Alessandra","Crippa, Alessandro","Ceccarelli, Silvia Busti","Mauri, Maddalena","Molteni, Massimo","Agostoni, Carlo","Nobile, Maria"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00787-016-0932-4","first_seen_on":"2016-12-18T01:14:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1435-165X"],"journal":"European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1493737696,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00787-016-0932-4","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00787-016-0932-4","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27988864"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00787-016-0932-4.pdf","pmid":"27988864","pubdate":"2016-12-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry","pediatrics"],"title":"The potential relevance of docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid to the etiopathogenesis of childhood neuropsychiatric disorders","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00787-016-0932-4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-relevance-docosahexaenoic-acid-eicosapentaenoic-acid-etiopathogenesis-childhood-neuropsych"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":2.35,"6m":1.35,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161493,"mean":6.8965394462124,"rank":3384073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4733337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161493,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263205,"mean":12.30464931384,"rank":103941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":157004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263205,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":784,"mean":4.7327892720307,"rank":395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":382,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":784,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":6.0122222222222,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
