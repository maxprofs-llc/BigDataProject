The pixel-to-pixel batch-processing was analogous to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry data. Each data point represented here by accurate m\/z values and the corresponding ion intensities was matched against integrated compound libraries. The fine isotopic structure matching was also embedded into CycloBranch dereplication process. The siderophores' characterization from single-pixel mass spectra was further supported by their de novo sequencing. New ketide building block library was utilized by CycloBranch to characterize the siderophores in images and mixtures and nomenclature of fragment ion series of linear and cyclic polyketide siderophores was proposed. The software is freely available at http:\/\/ms.biomed.cas.cz\/cyclobranch.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002395","authors":["Ji\u0159\u00ed Nov\u00e1k","Lucie Sokolov\u00e1","Karel Lemr","Tom\u00e1\u0161 Pluh\u00e1\u010dek","Andrea Palyzov\u00e1","Vladim\u00edr Havl\u00ed\u010dek"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbapap.2016.12.003","first_seen_on":"2016-12-18T04:11:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["15709639","0006-3002"],"journal":"BBA - Proteins & Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1497740235,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1570963916302606&_version=1&md5=692257a88cb136436e2aaf6dae45c790"],"pmid":"27956353","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Batch-processing of Imaging or Liquid-Chromatography Mass Spectrometry Datasets and De Novo Sequencing of Polyketide Siderophores","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/batchprocessing-imaging-liquidchromatography-mass-spectrometry-datasets-novo-sequencing-polyketide-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":1.35,"6m":1.35,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":4167175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4154776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277701,"mean":12.085654634497,"rank":138880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":135908,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277701,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251,"mean":2.099408,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.6,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
