The increasing number and combination of checkpoint inhibitors and the variety of their mechanisms of action and indications will most likely multiply the side effects associated with these therapies and make their management more complicated and diversified. Given the growing rate of approval of different checkpoint inhibitors in different cancers in multiple settings, a review summarizing the major side effects of the new agents in use today and their management seems to be appropriate. Highlighting these adverse events and their management in a single review might help the daily practice of the physicians and consequently contribute the patient's safety and quality of life.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f61000772f","authors":["Hampig Raphael Kourie"],"doi":"10.2217\/imt-2016-0029","endpage":"807","first_seen_on":"2016-07-04T12:19:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1750-7448","1750-743X"],"issue":"7","journal":"Immunotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1467507852,"links":["http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/doi\/abs\/10.2217\/imt-2016-0029"],"pmid":"27349979","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"799","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Immune checkpoint inhibitors side effects and management","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immune-checkpoint-inhibitors-side-effects-management"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7981790,"mean":6.7349664530035,"rank":6905367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7981790,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260423,"mean":11.50152243666,"rank":218741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260423,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":398,"mean":3.9830428211587,"rank":341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":398,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.7242105263158,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
