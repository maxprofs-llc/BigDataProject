SLN was prepared by ultrasonication method using tripalmitin and lecithin as lipid core and then the surface was coated with chitosan. Entrapment efficiency was greater than 99%, and mean particle size of SLN was 110.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.97\u00a0nm with significant increase in the coated SLN (c-SLN). Zeta potential was proportionally increased and reached plateau at 5% of chitosan coating with respect to tripalmitin. Differential scanning calorimetry showed disappearance of endothermic peak of quercetin in SLNs, indicating conversion of crystalline state to amorphous state. FTIR study of SLNs showed no change in the spectrum of quercetin, which indicates that the lipid and chitosan were not incompatible with quercetin. When coating amount was greater than 2.5% of tripalmitin, particle size and zeta potential were very stable even at 40\u00b0C up to 90\u00a0days. All SLN dispersions showed significantly faster release profile compared to pure quercetin powder. At pH\u00a07.0, the release rate was increased in proportion to the coating amount. Interestingly, at pH\u00a03.0, chitosan coating of 5.0% or greater decreased the rate. Cellular uptake of quercetin was performed using Caco-2 cells and showed that all SLN dispersions were significantly better than quercetin dispersed in distilled water. However, cellular uptake of quercetin from c-SLN was significantly lower than that from uncoated SLN.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067ed","authors":["Vijayakumar, Ajay","Baskaran, Rengarajan","Jang, Young Soo","Oh, Seung Hyun","Yoo, Bong Kyu"],"doi":"10.1208\/s12249-016-0573-4","first_seen_on":"2016-07-04T11:01:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1530-9932"],"journal":"AAPS PharmSciTech","last_mentioned_on":1467331200,"links":["http:\/\/pharmagateway.net\/ArticlePage.aspx?DOI=10.1208\/s12249-016-0573-4"],"pmid":"27368922","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Quercetin-Loaded Solid Lipid Nanoparticle Dispersion with Improved Physicochemical Properties and Cellular Uptake","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quercetinloaded-solid-lipid-nanoparticle-dispersion-improved-physicochemical-properties-cellular-upt"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7971101,"mean":6.7313029448827,"rank":1113498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6785373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7971101,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260327,"mean":11.504846530888,"rank":51912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":205016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260327,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":372,"mean":3.5748894878706,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":372,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":4.6103448275862,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
