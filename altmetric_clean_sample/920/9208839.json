Children enjoy play and adults can create opportunities for physical, emotional, and cognitive development through sport for all children. This article reviews the current state of youth sports in the US, highlighting some of the problems of the current model and efforts to transform and improve the youth sports experience in the US. The new model of youth sports emphasizes the importance of developing 'physical literacy' in all young athletes, increasing availability of recreational sports activities, providing quality coaching to all, improved sports safety, improved availability of sports venues for athletes at all levels, and at an affordable cost for all. The US Olympic Committee, following an innovative programme by USA Hockey, has developed and promoted the American Developmental Model to its component Sport National Governing Boards to improve the experience of young athletes. The sports-informed paediatric psychiatrist, knowledgeable about child and family development and aware of the local youth sports opportunities and challenges, is well prepared to advocate for a healthy and fun sport experience for every young athlete.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003eda","authors":["David O.
