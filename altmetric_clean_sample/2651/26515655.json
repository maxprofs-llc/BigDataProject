In the present study, we investigated the function of the chitin synthase A (CHSA) gene isolated from Mythimna separata. The majority of dsMysCHSA treated larvae (89.50%) exhibited lethal phenotypes, including three phenotypes with severe cuticle deformations. The dsMysCHSA treatment in adult females affected oogenesis, and significantly reduced the ovary size and the oviposition number compared with controls. To determine how MysCHSA affected female fecundity, we performed combined analyses of RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) transcriptome and TMT proteome (tandem mass tags) data in M. separata after treatment with MysCHSA-RNAi. The differentially expressed proteins and genes affected fecundity-related proteins, energy metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, amino sugars and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways. Taken together, these results suggested that MysCHSA acts on M. separata ecdysis and fecundity, and has the potential as a target gene for pest control. This article is protected by copyright.
