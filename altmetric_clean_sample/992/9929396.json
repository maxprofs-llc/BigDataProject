However, the prognostic relevance of MYH9 expression in acute myeloid leukemia is still unclear. Here, we found high MYH9 expressers were seen more frequently in females and more frequently in M4 morphology. We also found high MYH9 expressers had lower percentage of bone marrow blasts. In addition, overexpression of MYH9 was associated with an inferior overall survival. Notably, distinct microRNA signatures were seen in high MYH9 expressers. These results were also validated in an independent cohort of AML patients using the published data. In conclusion, gene of MYH9 expression might serve as a reliable predictor for overall survival in AML patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Yu, Mengxia","Wang, Jinghan","Zhu, Zhijuan","Hu, Chao","Ma, Qiuling","Li, Xia","Yin, Xiufeng","Huang, Jiansong","Zhang, Ting","Ma, Zhixin","Zhou, Yile","Li, Chenying","Chen, Feifei","Chen, Jian","Wang, Yungui","Pan, Hanzhang","Wang, Dongmei","Jin, Jie"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.10613","first_seen_on":"2016-07-21T18:07:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1469146751,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27437869?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27437869","pubdate":"2014-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Prognostic impact of <i>MYH9<\/i> expression on patients with acute myeloid leukemia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prognostic-impact-myh9-expression-patients-acute-myeloid-leukemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8091619,"mean":6.8840984628706,"rank":6145087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1086431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8091619,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258147,"mean":11.986017563704,"rank":182790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":40013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258147,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8545,"mean":3.0929948501873,"rank":4245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":2631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8545,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":7.1381186440678,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
