Our previous studies have shown that the total flavonoids (TFs) from Rosa laevigata Michx fruit has various activities, however, there were no papers reporting the role of the TFs against renal IRI. In the present work, a hypoxia\/reoxygenation (H\/R) model in NRK-52E cells and ischemia-reperfusion model in rats were used. The results showed that the TFs significantly attenuated cell injury and markedly decreased serum creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in rats. Further investigation revealed that the TFs markedly decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), up-regulated the levels of silent information regulator factor 2-related enzyme 1 (Sirt1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), down-regulated the levels of Kelch like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1) and the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-\u03baBp65 (NF-\u03baBp65), and decreased the mRNA levels of interleukine-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Furthermore, inhibiting Sirt1 by siRNA showed that the role of the natural product in protecting renal IRI was significantly attenuated, suggesting that the effect of the extract against renal IRI depended on Sirt1. Taken together, the TFs has significantly nephroprotective effect against IRI by affecting Sirt1\/Nrf2\/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, which should be developed as a new therapeutic agent or food additives to treat acute kidney injury in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Lisha Zhao","Lina Xu","Xufeng Tao","Xu Han","Lianhong Yin","Yan Qi","Jinyong Peng"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules21070952","first_seen_on":"2016-07-21T14:16:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"7","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1492596190,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/21\/7\/952?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27455216?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/21\/7\/952\/pdf","pmid":"27455216","pubdate":"2016-07-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Protective Effect of the Total Flavonoids from Rosa laevigata Michx Fruit on Renal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury through Suppression of Oxidative Stress and Inflammation","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protective-effect-total-flavonoids-rosa-laevigata-michx-fruit-renal-ischemiareperfusion-injury-throu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083930,"mean":6.8667526310456,"rank":6137591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1086383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083930,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258001,"mean":11.983730527131,"rank":182888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":39743,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258001,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3779,"mean":2.155651667549,"rank":1945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3779,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253,"mean":5.4362698412698,"rank":149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rnomics\/statuses\/756130700756029441","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9924575],"posted_on":"2016-07-21T14:16:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Fabrice Leclerc","url":"http:\/\/about.me\/leclercfabrice","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/461944449832984577\/OFZs5M7c_normal.png","description":"#RNomics, #RNA biology, RNA #bioinformatics, #RNA_World & #evolution, technologies & resources, daily papers: http:\/\/bit.ly\/HaycPM & http:\/\/bit.ly\/18cyMMK","id_on_source":"rnomics","tweeter_id":"177684507","geo":{"lt":46,"ln":2,"country":"FR"},"followers":1974},"tweet_id":"756130700756029441"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sRNAPapers\/statuses\/854636484313309186","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9924575],"posted_on":"2017-04-19T10:03:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Small RNA papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"sRNAPapers","tweeter_id":"3003428519","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":122},"tweet_id":"854636484313309186"}]}}
