This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of environmental strategies (creating single-patient rooms and reducing noise sources) in noise reduction in a pediatric intensive care unit.\nNoise measurement in the unit was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, measurements aimed at determining the unit's present level of noise were performed over 4 weeks in December 2013. During the month following the first measurement phase, the intensive care unit (ICU) was moved to a new location and noise-reducing strategies were implemented. The second phase, in May 2014, measured noise levels in the newly constructed environment.\nThe noise levels before and after environmental changes were statistically significant at 72.6 dB-A and 56 dB-A, respectively (p < .05).\nSingle-patient rooms and noise-reducing strategies can be effective in controlling environmental noise in the ICU.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c51","authors":["Kol, Emine","Ayd\u0131n, Perihan","Dursun, Oguz"],"doi":"10.1111\/jspn.12116","endpage":"217","first_seen_on":"2015-05-06T23:04:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1744-6155"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal for Specialists in Pediatric Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1439481973,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jspn.12116\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jspn.12116\/abstract;jsessionid=8E9D648F8D31FEE35CE1BAD4A055F991.f04t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jspn.12116\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jspn.12116\/pdf","pmid":"25943006","pubdate":"2015-05-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"210","subjects":["nursing","pediatrics"],"title":"The effectiveness of environmental strategies on noise reduction in a pediatric intensive care unit: Creation of single\u2010patient bedrooms and reducing noise sources","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effectiveness-environmental-strategies-noise-reduction-pediatric-intensive-care-unit-creation-single"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6369513,"mean":5.9833885302363,"rank":2265170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4063732,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6369513,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166955,"mean":9.4293949830493,"rank":65920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":98986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166955,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139,"mean":1.9425942028986,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.48125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
