Aims of this cross-sectional study were to study growth, serum IGF1 concentrations and bone health parameters assessed by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA).\nHeight was measured and converted to Z scores (HAZ). Serum IGF1 concentrations were measured (ELISA) in a subset. Bone mineral content for total body (less head) (TBBMC) and lumbar spine were measured (n=170, 77 boys, 6-16 year old) and converted to Z scores using local normative data.\nMean age was 11.1\u00b13.8 years, disease duration was 2.2\u00b12.5 years and HbA1C was 10.1\u00b11.8%. Diabetic children were shorter than reference population (HAZ -0.6\u00b11.1); Z scores for height and total body bone area (TBBA) for height were <-2SD in 12% & 6% respectively. Serum IGF1 Z scores were lower amongst group with longer disease duration (-1.58\u00b11.3 vs -2.63\u00b10.7; P=0.037). Disease duration (\u03b2= -0.180, P=0.000) and metabolic control (HbA1C; \u03b2= -0.096, P=0.042) were negative predictors of HAZ and TBBA for height Z in younger children. Using the Molgaard approach, children with longer disease duration had lower HAZ (-0.31\u00b10.92 vs -1.28\u00b11.11; P=0.000; \"short bones\") and TBBA for height Z scores (0.12\u00b11.62 vs -0.53\u00b10.94; P=0.044; \"slender bones\"). Older children (tanner stage 4, 5) had lower BMC and BA as compared to reference population possibly due to delayed growth spurt.\nLonger duration of diabetes was associated with shorter and slender but appropriately mineralized bones. Small and slender bones in diabetic children may increase risk of fragility fractures in future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002413","authors":["Parthasarathy, Lavanya S","Khadilkar, Vaman V","Chiplonkar, Shashi A","Zulf Mughal, M","Khadilkar, Anuradha V"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bone.2015.04.050","first_seen_on":"2015-05-06T01:25:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["8756-3282","1873-2763"],"journal":"BONE","last_mentioned_on":1436556865,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebonejournal.com%2Farticle%2FS8756-3282%252815%252900171-4%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=bon-site","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S8756328215001714"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.thebonejournal.com\/article\/S8756328215001714\/pdf","pmid":"25956533","pubdate":"2015-05-10T22:02:04+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","orthopedics"],"title":"Bone status of Indian children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bone-status-indian-children-adolescents-type-1-diabetes-mellitus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5337025,"mean":6.2508995271515,"rank":2213888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3037005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5337025,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162818,"mean":9.5115999926299,"rank":69390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":90132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162818,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1365,"mean":2.4048240469208,"rank":326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":1025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1365,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":1.1430555555556,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
