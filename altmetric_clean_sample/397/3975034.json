Insulin was found to be stable in a polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) consisting of insulin and LMWC in the presence of a Tris-buffer at pH 6.5. In the presence of LMWC, the stability of insulin increased with decreasing molecular weight of LMWC; 13 kDa LMWC was the most efficient molecular weight for enhancing the physical and chemical stability of insulin. Solubilization of insulin-LMWC polyelectrolyte complex (I-LMWC PEC) in a reverse micelle (RM) system, administered to diabetic rats, results in an oral delivery system for insulin with acceptable bioactivity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f61000668a","authors":["Al-Kurdi, Zakieh","Chowdhry, Babur Z.","Leharne, Stephen Z.","Omari, Mahmoud","Badwan, Adnan"],"doi":"10.3390\/md13041765","first_seen_on":"2015-05-07T09:49:54+00:00","issns":["1660-3397"],"issue":"4","journal":"Marine Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1430992185,"links":["http:\/\/gala.gre.ac.uk\/13603\/"],"pmid":"25830681","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["biology","pharmacology"],"title":"Low molecular weight chitosan\u2013insulin polyelectrolyte complex: characterization and stability studies","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/low-molecular-weight-chitosaninsulin-polyelectrolyte-complex-characterization-stability-studies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5067557,"mean":6.0017196092174,"rank":4215721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5067557,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158453,"mean":9.4415504632319,"rank":132155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158453,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":673,"mean":3.0564613095238,"rank":584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":673,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":2.6790697674419,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GALAeprints\/status\/596250559377592320","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3975034],"posted_on":"2015-05-07T09:49:45+00:00","author":{"name":"GALA","url":"http:\/\/gala.gre.ac.uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3727853971\/166bd9c80ba04ba20fb2ee40646f0a27_normal.png","description":"Greenwich Academic Literature Archive is repository storing research publications information created by research active staff at the University of Greenwich.","id_on_source":"GALAeprints","tweeter_id":"121729744","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":145},"tweet_id":"596250559377592320"}]}}
