Data was collected on patient demographics, antiemetics used, and time to disposition. We analyzed time of administration of the antiemetic used first line (ondansetron versus metoclopramide versus promethazine or prochlorperazine) to time the discharge order was placed.\nWe analyzed data from 439 women treated in the ED for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Forty-four percent received ondansetron alone, 47% received any other antiemetic alone, and 9% received more than one agent first line. Antiemetic agent selected did not differ by patient age, parity, current treatment for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, orthostatics, ketonuria or disposition. We found no difference in time from medication administration to disposition between women who received ondansetron and women who received any other antiemetic (metoclopramide, prochlorperazine or promethazine). Adjusting for potential confounders, compared to patients who received any other first line therapy, patients who received ondansetron had 2.09 times the odds of having a time to disposition at or above the 75th percentile (95% CI 1.31-3.34).\nThe use of ondansetron in the ED for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy was associated with similar mean time from administration to disposition as other antiemetics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005704","authors":["Mayhall, Elizabeth A","Gray, Robyn","Lopes, Vrishali","Matteson, Kristen A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajem.2015.03.032","first_seen_on":"2015-05-08T13:33:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-8171","07356757","0735-6757"],"journal":"American Journal of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1438510920,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S073567571500176X","http:\/\/www.ajemjournal.com\/article\/S0735-6757(15)00176-X\/abstract"],"pmid":"25921968","pubdate":"2015-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Comparison of antiemetics for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in an emergency department setting","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-antiemetics-nausea-vomiting-pregnancy-emergency-department-setting"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5436647,"mean":6.3270035691119,"rank":3599790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1610434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5436647,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164829,"mean":9.4854672021746,"rank":111353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":45719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164829,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1660,"mean":5.2014984930681,"rank":1194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1660,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":5.379756097561,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
