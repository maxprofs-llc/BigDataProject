Two group serum SERS spectra excited with nanoparticles are collected from healthy volunteers (n = 36) and bladder cancer patients (n = 55). Six diagnostic Raman bands in the regions of 481-486, 682-687, 1018-1034, 1313-1323, 1450-1459 and 1582-1587 cm(-1) related to proteins, nucleic acids and lipids are picked out with the GAs and LDA. By the diagnostic models built with the identified six Raman bands, the improved diagnostic sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 100% were acquired for classifying bladder cancer patients from normal serum SERS spectra. The results are superior to the sensitivity of 74.6% and specificity of 97.2% obtained with principal component analysis by the same serum SERS spectra dataset. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves further confirmed the efficiency of diagnostic algorithm based on GA-LDA technique. This exploratory work demonstrates that the serum SERS associated with GA-LDA technique has enormous potential to characterize and non-invasively detect bladder cancer through peripheral blood.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Shaoxin Li","Shaoxin Li","Linfang Li","Qiuyao Zeng","Yanjiao Zhang","Zhouyi Guo","Zhiming Liu","Mei Jin","Chengkang Su","Lin Lin","Junfa Xu","Songhao Liu"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep09582","first_seen_on":"2015-05-07T15:51:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1431360343,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/srep09582"],"pmid":"25947114","pubdate":"2015-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","subjects":["science"],"title":"Characterization and noninvasive diagnosis of bladder cancer with serum surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy and genetic algorithms","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-noninvasive-diagnosis-bladder-cancer-serum-surface-enhanced-raman-spectroscopy-gene-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5085280,"mean":6.0241177972752,"rank":2095116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2907647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5085280,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159426,"mean":9.4378080727616,"rank":67724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":88484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159426,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16194,"mean":13.46963440993,"rank":6674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":9141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16194,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1145,"mean":9.7943758741259,"rank":458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1145,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
