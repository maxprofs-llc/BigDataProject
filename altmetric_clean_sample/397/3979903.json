However, there is a need for high-level evidence for the preoperative use of steroids in nasal polyposis surgery. We aimed to assess the perioperative effect of preoperative use of oral prednisolone for advanced-stage diffuse nasal polyposis.\nProspective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.\nA visual analog scale (VAS) was evaluated for smell, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, facial pressure, headache, butanol smell threshold, and peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) before and after the use of study drug. Perioperative bleeding volume, visibility of operative field, operative time, hospital stay, and complication rate were also evaluated.\nThe improvement in the corticosteroid group (CG) in the VAS scores, butanol thresholds, and PNIF values showed statistically significant differences compared to the placebo group (PG) (P\u2009<\u2009.05). The perioperative bleeding volume, visibility score, operative time, and hospital stay for CG\/PG were 141 mL\/384 mL, 2.4\/3.4, 61 min\/71.6 min, and 1.1 day\/1.8 day, respectively (P\u2009<\u2009.05). The difference between the complication rates for the two groups did not show any statistically significant difference (P\u2009=\u2009.214).\nPreoperative administration of systemic corticosteroids improves the perioperative visibility by reducing blood loss and shortens the operation time. We recommend the use of preoperative corticosteroid for the safety of the patients. The optimum dose and duration have not been established and require further studies.\n1b Laryngoscope, 2015.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005aee","authors":["Ecevit, Mustafa Cenk","Erdag, Taner Kemal","Dogan, Ersoy","Sutay, Semih"],"doi":"10.1002\/lary.25352","endpage":"2045","first_seen_on":"2015-05-08T21:01:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1531-4995"],"issue":"9","journal":"Laryngoscope","last_mentioned_on":1431171215,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/lary.25352\/abstract;jsessionid=A777761E7D1943539996BB3762EC2151.f02t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/lary.25352\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Flary.25352&utm_content=buffer2fd46&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/lary.25352","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/lary.25352&utm_content=buffer2fd46&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/lary.25352\/pdf","pmid":"25945691","pubdate":"2015-05-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2041","subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Effect of steroids for nasal polyposis surgery: A placebo\u2010controlled, randomized, double\u2010blind study","type":"article","volume":"125","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-steroids-nasal-polyposis-surgery-placebocontrolled-randomized-doubleblind-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6370077,"mean":5.9834165460508,"rank":2265510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4063969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6370077,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167480,"mean":9.3916016336377,"rank":66041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":99388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167480,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2260,"mean":2.1470358565737,"rank":494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":1731,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2260,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":1.78,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
