They occur in approximately 1\/5,000 births, and some are lethal. Since the most recent publication of the Nosology and Classification of Genetic Skeletal Disorders, genetic causes of 56 skeletal disorders have been uncovered. This remarkable rate of discovery is largely due to the expanded use of high-throughput genomic technologies. In this review, we discuss these recent discoveries and our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind these skeletal dysplasia phenotypes. We also cover potential therapies, unusual genetic mechanisms, and novel skeletal syndromes both with and without known genetic causes. The acceleration of skeletal dysplasia genetics is truly spectacular, and these advances hold great promise for diagnostics, risk prediction, and therapeutic design. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics Volume 16 is August 31, 2015.
