In this study, an acute and repetitive hypoxia mouse model, two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF\/TOF-MS), and Western blot experiments were used to identify the differential expression of key proteins in the mouse brain during HPC. Approximately 2100 2D-DIGE spots were observed following gel imaging and spot detection. Significant differences (p<0.05) in the expression of 66 proteins were observed between the 3\u00d7 HPC treatment group and the control group, 45 proteins were observed between the 6\u00d7 HPC treatment group and the control group, and 70 proteins were observed between the 3\u00d7 HPC treatment group and the 6\u00d7 HPC group. Consistent results among Western blot, 2D-DIGE and MS methods were observed for the proteins, ATP synthase subunit alpha, malate dehydrogenase, guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-1 and proteasome subunit alpha type-2. The proteins associated with ATP synthesis and the citric acid cycle were down-regulated, while those linked to glycolysis and oxygen-binding were up-regulated. This proteomic analysis of the mouse brain after HPC furthers understanding of the molecular pathways involved in the protective effect of HPC and these findings provide new insight into the mechanisms of hypoxia and HPC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ef","authors":["Cui, Can","Zhou, Tao","Li, Jingyi","Wang, Hong","Li, Xiaorong","Xiong, Jie","Xu, Pingxiang","Xue, Ming"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cbi.2015.04.010","first_seen_on":"2015-05-07T00:33:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-7786"],"journal":"Chemico-Biological Interactions","last_mentioned_on":1440584560,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25937538?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25937538","pubdate":"2015-05-07T22:05:06+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Proteomic analysis of the mouse brain after repetitive exposure to hypoxia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proteomic-analysis-mouse-brain-after-repetitive-exposure-hypoxia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5552256,"mean":6.3814498674846,"rank":3914459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":929047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5552256,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168257,"mean":9.4316338793268,"rank":121584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":28213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168257,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":477,"mean":2.1014033613445,"rank":275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":477,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.3,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
