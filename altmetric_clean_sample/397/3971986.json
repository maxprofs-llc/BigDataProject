Information regarding baseline daily alcohol consumption was abstracted from a research questionnaire for 3067 BRCA mutation carriers enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Women were followed biennially until the date of the last follow-up questionnaire, date of breast cancer diagnosis, date of prophylactic bilateral mastectomy, or date of death. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95\u00a0% confidence intervals (CIs) for invasive breast cancer associated with alcohol consumed at or prior to completion of the baseline questionnaire. After a mean of 5.4\u00a0years of follow-up, we observed 259 incident cases of primary invasive breast cancer. Compared with non-users, the adjusted RRs were 1.06 (95\u00a0% CI 0.78-1.44) for ever use and 1.08 (0.79-1.47) for current alcohol use. For women in the highest versus lowest quintile of cumulative alcohol consumption, the RR was 0.94 (95\u00a0% CI 0.63-1.40; P trend\u00a0=\u00a00.65). Our findings suggest that alcohol consumption is not a risk factor for breast cancer among women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006cf8","authors":["Cybulski, Cezary","Lubinski, Jan","Huzarski, Tomasz","Lynch, Henry T","Randall, Susan Armel","Neuhausen, Susan L","Senter, Leigha","Friedman, Susan","Ainsworth, Peter","Singer, Christian","Foulkes, William D","Narod, Steven A","Sun, Ping","Kotsopoulos, Joanne"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10549-015-3393-4","first_seen_on":"2015-05-06T12:06:01+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1573-7217"],"journal":"Breast Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1437483932,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25935583\/?i=7&from=brca1","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10549-015-3393-4"],"pmid":"25935583","pubdate":"2015-05-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Prospective evaluation of alcohol consumption and the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prospective-evaluation-alcohol-consumption-risk-breast-cancer-brca1-brca2-mutation-carriers-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7027733,"mean":6.2644487720904,"rank":1360466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5658143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7027733,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200804,"mean":8.617054605758,"rank":50935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":149447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200804,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1608,"mean":4.2201070317362,"rank":270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":1333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1608,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":3.6016,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
