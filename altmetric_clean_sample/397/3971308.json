But he has also been struck by how often similar problems with statistical analysis reporting come up during the review process. Acknowledging that statistics can be scary, he advocates that they should be simply viewed as a means of communicating ideas. In this editorial, he provides some straightforward guidelines on reporting statistical analyses in peer review journal articles, highlights pitfalls to avoid and illustrates best practice to aim for.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029c0","authors":["Stephens, Richard","Grant, Maria J."],"doi":"10.1111\/hir.12106","endpage":"83","first_seen_on":"2015-05-06T06:18:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1471-1842"],"issue":"2","journal":"Health Information & Libraries Journal","last_mentioned_on":1432218947,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/hir.12106\/abstract;jsessionid=865EA8ABABE53609FABB9149372FF183.f03t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/hir.12106\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/hir.12106\/pdf","pmid":"25943969","pubdate":"2015-05-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Health Professions","Social Sciences"],"startpage":"81","subjects":["healthservices","medicalinformatics"],"title":"Reporting statistical analyses in peer review journal articles","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reporting-statistical-analyses-peer-review-journal-articles-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6371556,"mean":5.9847947620322,"rank":1172348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5193242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6371556,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167854,"mean":9.4103937016318,"rank":44770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":122804,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167854,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234,"mean":3.8821802575107,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.5611111111111,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Ph.
