Loving it. #realtimechem","Great paper characterising a 17-elecron Cr radical sought after for over 40 years!","The long-sought seventeen-electron radical +: isolation, crystal structure and substitution reaction"],"citation":{"abstract":"A highly air-sensitive seventeen-electron half-sandwich radical, [(C6Me6)Cr(CO)3](+), which has been long sought over 40 years, was isolated and structurally characterized. EPR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations indicate that the spin density mainly resides on the chromium atom. The radical can undergo a substitution reaction with PPh3 to form a more stable cation, [(C6Me6)Cr(CO)2(PPh3)](+). This work provides a direct observation of the radical process for CO-substitution reactions found in (arene)M(CO)3 (M = Cr, Mo, or W) systems, and suggests that other stable radicals of the type [(arene)M(CO)3](+) are accessible.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e2","authors":["Wenqing Wang","Xingyong Wang","Zaichao Zhang","Ningning Yuan","Xinping Wang"],"doi":"10.1039\/c5cc01941a","endpage":"8413","first_seen_on":"2015-05-07T07:53:18+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1364-548X"],"issue":"40","journal":"Chemical Communications","last_mentioned_on":1431288170,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2015\/cc\/c5cc01941a#.VUsZrDFpmY0.twitter","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2015\/cc\/c5cc01941a\/unauth","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/CC\/c5cc01941a#%21divAbstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1039\/c5cc01941a","http:\/\/xlink.rsc.org\/?doi=10.1039\/c5cc01941a"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2015\/cc\/c5cc01941a","pmid":"25820609","pubdate":"2015-03-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"8410","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"The long-sought seventeen-electron radical [(C6Me6)Cr(CO)3]+: isolation, crystal structure and substitution reaction","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longsought-seventeenelectron-radical-c6me6crco3-isolation-crystal-structure-substitution-reaction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5076526,"mean":6.0149281329265,"rank":386467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":4686761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5076526,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159302,"mean":9.4332621640794,"rank":19809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":139379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159302,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4354,"mean":2.7349542844016,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":4224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4354,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228,"mean":3.6420792951542,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
