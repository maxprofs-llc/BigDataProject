Objective We tested the hypothesis that elevated lipoprotein(a) observationally and causally is associated with low-grade inflammation together with aortic valve stenosis and myocardial infarction. Design and setting Using a multidirectional Mendelian randomization approach, we studied 100,578 individuals from the Danish general population with plasma levels of and\/or genotypes known to affect levels of lipoprotein(a) and C-reactive protein, and using information regarding diagnosis of aortic valve stenosis and of myocardial infarction from registries. Results Observationally, C-reactive protein increased by 29% (95%CI:23;34) per 50 mg\/dL increase in lipoprotein(a). However, two LPA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the kringle IV type 2 (KIV-2) genotype that were associated with 98 mg\/dL, 95 mg\/dL and 68 mg\/dL higher lipoprotein(a) levels, were not causally associated with increased C-reactive protein levels. For aortic valve stenosis, a one standard deviation increase in lipoprotein(a) levels was associated observationally with a multifactorially adjusted hazard ratio of 1.23(95%CI:1.06;1.41), with corresponding causal risk ratios of 1.38(1.23;1.55) based on LPA SNPs and of 1.21(1.06;1.40) based on LPA KIV-2 genotype. For myocardial infarction, corresponding values were 1.20(1.10;1.31) observationally, and 1.18(1.11;1.26) and 1.31(1.22;1.42) causally, respectively. Observational hazard ratios for aortic valve stenosis and myocardial infarction were similar after further adjustment for C-reactive protein levels. Conclusions Elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) were not causally associated with increased low-grade inflammation as measured through C-reactive protein, despite a causal association with increased risk of aortic valve stenosis and myocardial infarction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be1","authors":["Anne Langsted"],"doi":"10.1210\/jc.2015-1096","first_seen_on":"2015-05-06T10:40:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1945-7197"],"journal":"The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1433016274,"links":["http:\/\/press.endocrine.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1210\/jc.2015-1096","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25938632","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25938632\/"],"pmid":"25938632","pubdate":"2015-05-06T22:03:11+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Elevated lipoprotein(a) does not cause low-grade inflammation, despite causal association with aortic valve stenosis and myocardial infarction: a study of 100,578 individuals from the general population.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/elevated-lipoproteina-not-cause-lowgrade-inflammation-despite-causal-association-aortic-valve-stenos"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5165331,"mean":6.0999753905388,"rank":1029905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":4130648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5165331,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160394,"mean":9.4430665926819,"rank":43302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":116795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160394,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5339,"mean":6.3659333083552,"rank":1035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5339,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":22.698363636364,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":3,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
