Despite many efforts, PSC-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs) have repeatedly induced tumors in animal models even though pluripotent cells were not detected. We found that polysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM)(-) cells among the early NPCs caused tumors, whereas PSA-NCAM(+) cells were nontumorigenic. Molecular profiling, global gene analysis, and multilineage differentiation of PSA-NCAM(-) cells confirm that they are multipotent neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) that could differentiate into both ectodermal and mesodermal lineages. Transplantation of PSA-NCAM(-) cells in a gradient manner mixed with PSA-NCAM(+) cells proportionally increased mesodermal tumor formation and unwanted grafts such as PERIPHERIN(+) cells or pigmented cells in the rat brain. Therefore, we suggest that NCSCs are a critical target for tumor prevention in hPSC-derived NPCs, and removal of PSA-NCAM(-) cells eliminates the tumorigenic potential originating from NCSCs after transplantation.","altmetric_jid":"52d5438d3cf05876028b4567","authors":["Lee, Dongjin R","Yoo, Jeong-Eun","Lee, Jae Souk","Park, Sanghyun","Lee, Junwon","Park, Chul-Yong","Ji, Eunhyun","Kim, Han-Soo","Hwang, Dong-Youn","Kim, Dae-Sung","Kim, Dong-Wook"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.stemcr.2015.04.002","first_seen_on":"2015-05-06T00:13:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2213-6711"],"journal":"Stem Cell Reports","last_mentioned_on":1430576100,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/stem-cell-reports\/abstract\/S2213-6711(15)00102-2"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S2213671115001022\/pdf","pmid":"25937368","pubdate":"2015-05-06T22:04:12+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"PSA-NCAM-Negative Neural Crest Cells Emerging during Neural Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells Cause Mesodermal Tumors and Unwanted Grafts","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/psancamnegative-neural-crest-cells-emerging-during-neural-induction-pluripotent-stem-cells-cause-mes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5047430,"mean":5.9756394298971,"rank":4198172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5047430,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157564,"mean":9.4326800073623,"rank":131420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157564,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":433,"mean":18.113425925926,"rank":410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":433,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":18.715529411765,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
