Although EMT-mediated cellular and molecular changes are well understood, very little is known about EMT-induced metabolic changes. HER2-positive BT-474 breast cancer cells were induced to undergo a stable EMT using mammosphere culture, as previously described by us for the ER\u03b1-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Two epithelial breast cancer cell lines (BT-474 and MCF-7) were compared to their respective EMT-derived mesenchymal progeny (BT-474EMT and MCF-7EMT) for changes in metabolic pathways including glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, anabolic pathways and gluconeogenesis. Both EMT-derived cells displayed enhanced aerobic glycolysis along with overexpression of specific glucose transporters, lactate dehydrogenase isoforms, monocarboxylate transporters and glycogen phosphorylase isoform. In contrast, both EMT-derived cells suppressed the expression of crucial enzymes in anabolic pathways and gluconeogenesis. STAT3, a transcription factor involved in tumor initiation and progression, plays a role in the EMT-related changes in the expression of specific enzymes and transporters. This study provides a broad overview of similar metabolic changes induced by EMT in two independent breast cancer cell lines. These metabolic changes may provide novel therapeutic targets for metastatic breast cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000249e","authors":["Kondaveeti, Yuvabharath","Reed, Irene K Guttilla","White, Bruce A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.canlet.2015.04.025","first_seen_on":"2015-05-06T17:31:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-7980","0304-3835"],"journal":"Cancer Letters","last_mentioned_on":1430933481,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0304383515002931"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cancerletters.info\/article\/S0304383515002931\/pdf","pmid":"25917568","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition induces similar metabolic alterations in two independent breast cancer cell lines","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epithelialmesenchymal-transition-induces-similar-metabolic-alterations-two-independent-breast-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5064760,"mean":6.0008712813393,"rank":4213828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5064760,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157865,"mean":9.4516172021488,"rank":131729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157865,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1393,"mean":2.1878117816092,"rank":1003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1393,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.8396470588235,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
