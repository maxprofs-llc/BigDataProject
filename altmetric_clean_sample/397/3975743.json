Both CARD16 and CARD17 were previously reported as inhibitory homologs of CASP1; however, their molecular function remains unclear. Here, we identified that oligomerization activity allows CARD16 to function as a CASP1 activator. We investigated the molecular characteristics of CARD16 and CARD17 in transiently transfected HeLa cells. Although both CARD16 and CARD17 interacted with CASP1CARD, only CARD16 formed a homo-oligomer. Oligomerized CARD16 formed a filament-like structure with CASP1CARD and a speck with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD. A filament-like structure formed by CARD16 promoted CASP1 filament assembly and IL-1\u03b2 release. In contrast, CARD17 did not form a homo-oligomer or filaments and inhibited CASP1-dependent IL-1\u03b2 release. Mutated CARD16D27G, mimicking the CARD17 amino acid sequence, formed a homo-oligomer but failed to form a filament-like structure. Consequently, CARD16D27G weakly promoted CASP1 filament assembly and subsequent IL-1\u03b2 release. These results suggest that oligomerized CARD16 promotes CARD-mediated molecular assembly and CASP1 activation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f61000740a","authors":["Karasawa, Tadayoshi","Kawashima, Akira","Usui, Fumitake","Kimura, Hiroaki","Shirasuna, Koumei","Inoue, Yoshiyuki","Komada, Takanori","Kobayashi, Motoi","Mizushina, Yoshiko","Sagara, Junji","Takahashi, Masafumi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fob.2015.04.011","first_seen_on":"2015-05-07T14:30:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["22115463","2211-5463"],"journal":"FEBS Open Bio","last_mentioned_on":1431009000,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2211546315000418"],"pmid":"25973362","pubdate":"2015-05-15T22:01:57+00:00","title":"Oligomerized CARD16 promotes caspase-1 assembly and IL-1\u03b2 processing ","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oligomerized-card16-promotes-caspase1-assembly-il1%CE%B2-processing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5067587,"mean":6.0018363339087,"rank":3558121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":851808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5067587,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158434,"mean":9.4424558141297,"rank":114749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":26296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158434,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":354,"mean":1.1965779036827,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":354,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":2.4361176470588,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
