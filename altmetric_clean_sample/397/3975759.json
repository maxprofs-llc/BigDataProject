Hair specimens were collected by plucking out with the roots intact, and these specimens were prepped by an opti-mized procedure based on freeze-sectioning to detect the drug inside the hair shaft and hair root. Time-course changes in the imaging results, with confirmatory quantitative liquid chromatography - MS\/MS analysis for each one-mm segment of sin-gle hair strands, revealed substantial concentration of the drug first onto the hair bulbs after ingestion, while only a small portion appeared to be incorporated into the hair matrix, forming a 2-3 mm distinctive drug band with tailing. Comparable amount of the drug also appeared to be incorporated into the keratinized hair shaft in the upper dermis zone, forming an-other distinct drug band of about 2-mm, which both moved toward the distal side, following the strand's growth rate. These findings provide forensically crucial information: there are two major drug incorporation sites, at least for MOP, which cause overlap of the recordings and deteriorates its chronological resolution down to about eleven days or perhaps longer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Tooru Kamata"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.analchem.5b00971","first_seen_on":"2015-05-07T14:32:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-6882"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1431009132,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.analchem.5b00971?hootPostID=bf63354198c4a65ff529009cfa0cb71b&"],"pmid":"25919888","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Time-Course Mass Spectrometry Imaging for Depicting Drug Incorporation into Hair","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/timecourse-mass-spectrometry-imaging-depicting-drug-incorporation-hair"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8447550,"mean":7.1019350753613,"rank":4202109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4180975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8447550,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209466,"mean":8.9532365216147,"rank":103929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":103594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209466,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019,"mean":3.4366430531305,"rank":3812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":2.7934505494505,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
