The target of measurement was the VOT for the word-initial voiceless consonant \/t\/.\nWhen the target syllable appeared in a sentence following a comma, or at the beginning of a sentence following a period, the ABSD patients' VOTs were significantly longer than those of the ADSD patients and controls. Abnormal prolongation of the VOTs was related to the pause or silence between the test word and the preceding word.\nVOTs in spasmodic dysphonia (SD) may vary according to the SD subtype or speaking conditions. VOT measurement was suggested to be a useful method for quantifying voice symptoms in SD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ada","authors":["Yanagida, Saori","Nishizawa, Noriko","Mizoguchi, Kenji","Hatakeyama, Hiromitsu","Fukuda, Satoshi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jvoice.2014.09.028","first_seen_on":"2015-05-07T22:40:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-4588"],"journal":"Journal of Voice","last_mentioned_on":1431038407,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25944292?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25944292","pubdate":"2015-05-08T22:05:29+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Performing Arts And Creative Writing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Health Professions"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Voice Onset Time for the Word-Initial Voiceless Consonant \/t\/ in Japanese Spasmodic Dysphonia-A Comparison With Normal Controls.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/voice-onset-time-wordinitial-voiceless-consonant-t-japanese-spasmodic-dysphonia-comparison-normal-co"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5067587,"mean":6.0018363339087,"rank":2676157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1729760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5067587,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158434,"mean":9.4424526582216,"rank":91438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":51290,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158434,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":619,"mean":1.871003236246,"rank":247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":619,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.807619047619,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
