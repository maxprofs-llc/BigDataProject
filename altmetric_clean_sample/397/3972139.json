Anal\u2026"],"citation":{"abstract":"Microfluidic chemotaxis platforms have historically been utilized to probe phenomena such as neutrophil migration and are beginning to be developed for diagnostic applications. However, current microfluidic chemotaxis systems require specialized engineering equipment such as syringe pumps and long time frames (hours) to develop a chemokine gradient and the cell chemotaxis typically requires multiple hours. The paperfluidic device described in this work describes a low cost, sharp (2 mm wide), quasi stable (at least 20 min) and rapidly generated (<1 s) chemokine gradient system capable of examining cell migration response over short time frames (20 min) that can be easily assembled. A proof-of-concept experiment on human pan-T cells showed significant (p < 0.01) directed migration to the chemokine gradient over the control condition. This new technique for cell migration studies provides a foundational step in designing microfluidic chemotactic platforms for point-of-care diagnostics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["David Ignatius Walsh III"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.analchem.5b00726","first_seen_on":"2015-05-06T13:12:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-6882"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1450563070,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.analchem.5b00726","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25938457?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.analchem.5b00726?hootPostID=af4a47bcc20957f10a0744ccbd197653&"],"pmid":"25938457","pubdate":"2015-05-06T22:03:17+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Cell Chemotaxis on Paper for Diagnostics","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cell-chemotaxis-paper-diagnostics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6792385,"mean":6.175626080326,"rank":1442566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5338984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6792385,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199715,"mean":8.5890205093285,"rank":55587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":143495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199715,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6101,"mean":3.2134652459016,"rank":704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":5388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6101,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":2.6042142857143,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
