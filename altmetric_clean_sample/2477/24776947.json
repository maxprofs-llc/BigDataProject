We aimed to explore the current prevalence of stroke and its associated risk factors in northeast China.\nPopulation based cross sectional study.\nData were collected using a structured precoded questionnaire designed by the Stroke Screening and Prevention Programme of the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China, between January and March 2016.\n4100 permanent residents, aged 40 years or older, who had lived in Dehui City of Jilin Province for more than 6 months volunteered to participate in the survey, with a response rate of 92.2%. For the purpose of the present analysis, 48 subjects were excluded due to missing values, giving a total of 4052 people included in this analysis.\nThe questionnaire included demographic characteristics, stroke related behavioural factors, personal and family medical history of stroke, physical examination and laboratory testing.\nThe overall prevalence of stroke in Jilin Province was 7.2% (95% CI 6.3% to 8.2%). Of all stroke cases, 91.7% (95% CI 87.4% to 94.6%) were ischaemic stroke and 8.3% (95% CI 5.4% to 12.6%) were haemorrhagic stroke. The prevalence rates of dyslipidaemia, smoking and hypertension were ranked as the top three cerebrovascular risk factors and were 62.1%, 61.8% and 57.3%, respectively. We found that hypertension, dyslipidaemia and lack of exercise were associated with ischaemic stroke. However, only hypertension (OR=4.064, 95%\u2009CI 1.358 to 12.160) was significantly associated with haemorrhagic stroke.\nThe prevalence of stroke, especially ischaemic stroke, and associated cerebrovascular risk factors among adults aged 40 years or older in northeast China were high. A higher regional prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and lack of exercise may be responsible.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Fu-Liang Zhang","Zhen-Ni Guo","Yan-Hua Wu","Hao-Yuan Liu","Yun Luo","Ming-Shuo Sun","Ying-Qi Xing","Yi Yang"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-015758","first_seen_on":"2017-09-05T00:20:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"9","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1504570801,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/7\/9\/e015758"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/bmjopen\/7\/9\/e015758.full.pdf","pmid":"28871014","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","startpage":"e015758","title":"Prevalence of stroke and associated risk factors: a population based cross sectional study from northeast China","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-stroke-associated-risk-factors-population-based-cross-sectional-study-northeast-china"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360463,"mean":7.0503912403329,"rank":7227206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360463,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114571,"mean":12.03090041023,"rank":92868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114571,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6200,"mean":17.012763994193,"rank":5714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6200,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248,"mean":8.6378137651822,"rank":211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/chinamedicine\/statuses\/904861639438106625","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24776947],"posted_on":"2017-09-05T00:20:01+00:00","author":{"name":"China Medical News","url":"http:\/\/www.chinesemedicalnews.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/473812471711416320\/VOoO59TW_normal.jpeg","description":"Independent news on medicine and healthcare in China, by medical journalist Michael Woodhead","id_on_source":"chinamedicine","tweeter_id":"946587205","geo":{"lt":35,"ln":105,"country":"CN"},"followers":1823},"tweet_id":"904861639438106625"}]}}
