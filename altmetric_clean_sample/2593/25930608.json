Leukocytes count, procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and paraoxonase (PON) and arylesterase (ARE) activities of PON-1 were assayed from blood obtained on ICU presentation. Logistic regression was used to derive sepsis mortality score (SMS), a prediction equation describing the relationship between biomarkers and 30-day mortality.\nThe 30-day mortality rate was 28.9%. The SMS was [\u0435logit(p)\/(1+\u0435logit(p))]\u00d7100; logit(p)=0.74+(0.004\u00d7PCT)+(0.001\u00d7IL-6)-(0.025\u00d7ARE)-(0.059\u00d7leukocytes count). The SMC had higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95% Cl) than SOFA score [0.814 (0.736-0.892) vs. 0.767 (0.677-0.857)], but is not statistically significant. When the SMS was added to the SOFA score, prediction of 30-day mortality improved compared to SOFA score used alone [0.845 (0.777-0.899), p=0.022].\nA sepsis mortality score using baseline leukocytes count, PCT, IL-6 and ARE was derived, which predicted 30-day mortality with very good performance and added significant prognostic information to SOFA score.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a20","authors":["Wan Fadzlina Wan Muhd Shukeri","Azrina Md Ralib","Nor Zamzila Abdulah","Mohd Basri Mat-Nor"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jcrc.2017.09.009","first_seen_on":"2017-09-18T02:54:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["08839441","1557-8615"],"journal":"Journal of Critical Care","last_mentioned_on":1505703285,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28903084"],"pmid":"28903084","pubdate":"2018-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["criticalcare"],"title":"Sepsis mortality score for the prediction of mortality in septic patients","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sepsis-mortality-score-prediction-mortality-septic-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":4502883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2348336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110545,"mean":11.840319040382,"rank":59680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":39361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110545,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1096,"mean":4.3647744292237,"rank":642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1096,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":3.4242857142857,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TimSweeney83\/statuses\/909611625107177472","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25930608],"posted_on":"2017-09-18T02:54:45+00:00","author":{"name":"Tim Sweeney","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/timothy-sweeney-a6589594","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/715998021645942785\/6ZL7Up1D_normal.jpg","description":"physician and data scientist, focused on the host response in infectious disease and critical illness. co-founder & CEO @ Inflammatix (https:\/\/t.co\/v2QCSjKFK7)","id_on_source":"TimSweeney83","tweeter_id":"2313041402","geo":{"lt":37.77493,"ln":-122.41942,"country":"US"},"followers":161},"tweet_id":"909611625107177472"}]}}
