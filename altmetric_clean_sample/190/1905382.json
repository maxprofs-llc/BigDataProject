A problem for any selection study is that predictor-outcome correlations are known only in those who have been selected, whereas selectors need to know how measures would predict in the entire pool of applicants. That problem of interpretation can be solved by calculating construct-level predictive validity, an estimate of true predictor-outcome correlation across the range of applicant abilities.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007c7","authors":["IC McManus","Chris Dewberry","Sandra Nicholson","Jonathan S Dowell","Katherine Woolf","Henry WW Potts"],"doi":"10.1186\/1741-7015-11-243","first_seen_on":"2013-11-14T11:32:24+00:00","funders":["dohuk"],"issns":["1741-7015",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1475484180,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7015\/11\/243","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7015\/11\/243\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1741-7015-11-243","http:\/\/eprints.bbk.ac.uk\/9264\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24229353","https:\/\/bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1741-7015-11-243"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1741-7015-11-243.pdf","pmid":"24229353","pubdate":"2013-11-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"243","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Construct-level predictive validity of educational attainment and intellectual aptitude tests in medical student selection: meta-regression of six UK longitudinal studies","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/constructlevel-predictive-validity-educational-attainment-intellectual-aptitude-tests-medical-studen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":20.83,"score_history":{"1y":5.08,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":20.83},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002013,"mean":6.750266627688,"rank":386408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7616229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002013,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145720,"mean":6.9979438920115,"rank":7988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":137732,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145720,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1595,"mean":29.792342534504,"rank":443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":1152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1595,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":46.43732,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
