The majority of patients can be cured with either fertility-preserving surgery alone or a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Relapses occur in 10% to 20% of patients, and the significant proportion of them can be salvaged with chemotherapy. There is no evidence that treatment for malignant ovarian germ cell tumors will adversely affect menstrual or reproductive functions, increase future pregnancy loss, or increase the risk of congenital malformations of the fetus. Late effects, such as secondary leukemia, from chemotherapy are reported but rare.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f610008359","doi":"10.1097\/ogx.0b013e318234ede9","first_seen_on":"2013-11-14T11:56:45+00:00","issns":["0029-7828"],"issue":"8","journal":"Obstetrical and Gynecological Survey","last_mentioned_on":1384430158,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/obgynsurvey\/Abstract\/2011\/08000\/Management_of_Malignant_Ovarian_Germ_Cell_Tumors.17.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/obgynsurvey\/2011\/08000\/Management_of_Malignant_Ovarian_Germ_Cell_Tumors.17.pdf","pmid":"22018453","pubdate":"2011-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"507","subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Management of Malignant Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-malignant-ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505617,"mean":5.1020565259269,"rank":3135727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1019076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505617,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102553,"mean":7.6320550549966,"rank":71197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":22748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102553,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1055,"mean":0.82927134724858,"rank":321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1055,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":0.52065217391304,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/obgynsurvey\/status\/400955263508697088","license":"public","citation_ids":[1905446],"posted_on":"2013-11-14T11:55:58+00:00","author":{"name":"obgynsurvey","url":"http:\/\/www.obgynsurvey.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1735341352\/ogxtwitter_normal.jpg","description":"Obstetrical and Gynecological survey publishes concise, easy-to-read summaries that provide expert insight into how to apply the latest research to patient care","id_on_source":"obgynsurvey","tweeter_id":"456065195","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":76},"tweet_id":"400955263508697088"}]}}
