Our goal is to train children with CP after wrist tendon transfer surgery using a robotic therapy system consisting of two robot arms and wrist robots. The therapeutic goal is to determine if the robot training combined with surgery intervention improved functional outcomes significantly more than surgery alone. To accomplish this long-term goal we have developed a Bilateral ADL Exercise Robot, BiADLER aimed at training children with CP in reach to grasp coordination on ADLs. Specifically, the robot will provide active training using an assist-as-needed. This paper presents the design concepts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90e3cf058f61000cbcd","authors":["D Holley","A Theriault","S Kamara","V Anewenter","D Hughes","M J Johnson"],"doi":"10.1109\/icorr.2013.6650463","first_seen_on":"2013-11-16T04:06:27+00:00","issns":["1945-7901"],"journal":"IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics proceedings","last_mentioned_on":1384574758,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24187280"],"pmid":"24187280","pubdate":"2013-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Restoring ADL function after wrist surgery in children with cerebral palsy: A novel Bilateral robot system design.","type":"article","volume":"2013","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/restoring-adl-function-after-wrist-surgery-children-cerebral-palsy-novel-bilateral-robot-system-desi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3065678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":944158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91723,"mean":8.0890372211685,"rank":61098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":19298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91723,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.68181818181818,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
