However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. In the present study, we observed that MM-hMSCs exhibited an abnormal upregulation of miR-135b, showing meanwhile an impaired osteogenic differentiation and a decrease of SMAD5 expression, which is the target of miR-135b involved in osteogenesis. By gain and loss of function studies we confirmed that miR-135b negatively regulated hMSCs osteogenesis. We also found that MM cell-produced factors stimulated ND-hMSCs to upregulate the expression of miR-135b. Importantly, treatment with a miR-135b inhibitor promoted osteogenic differentiation in MM-hMSCs. Finally, we observed that MM cell-derived soluble factors could induce an upregulation of miR-135b expression in ND-hMSCs in an indirect coculture system and the miR-135b expression turned to normal level after the removal of MM cells. Collectively, we provide evidence that miR-135b is involved in the impaired osteogenic differentiation of MSCs derived from MM patients and might therefore be a promising target for controlling bone disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Song Xu","Gaia Cecilia Santini","Kim De Veirman","Isabelle Vande Broek","Xavier Leleu","Ann De Becker","Ben Van Camp","Karin Vanderkerken","Ivan Van Riet"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0079752","first_seen_on":"2013-11-14T13:38:12+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1384439094,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24223191"],"pmid":"24223191","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Upregulation of miR-135b Is Involved in the Impaired Osteogenic Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Derived from Multiple Myeloma Patients.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/upregulation-mir135b-involved-impaired-osteogenic-differentiation-mesenchymal-stem-cells-derived-mul-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":2671042,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1694331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108088,"mean":7.8368418588732,"rank":53177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":40760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108088,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88909,"mean":9.2643371575112,"rank":50879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":27857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88909,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3933,"mean":12.044679552391,"rank":2242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3933,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
