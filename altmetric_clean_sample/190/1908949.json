Crystals of (TDAE)(O2SSSSO2) (2) were obtained from orange solution over the purple solid. The Raman spectrum of [TDAE](2+) was established using (TDAE)(A) salts [A = 2Br(-), 2Br(-)\u00b72H2O (X-ray), 2[Br3](-) (X-ray)]. Vibrational spectroscopy showed that [O2SSO2](2-) in 1 has C2h geometry. The X-ray structure of 2 showed that it contained [O2SSSSO2](2-), the first example of a new class of sulfur oxyanions, the polythionites. The geometry of [O2SSSSO2](2-) consists of S2 with an S-S bond length of 2.003(1) \u00c5 connected to two terminal SO2 moieties by much longer S-S bonds of 2.337(1) \u00c5. Calculations (B3PW91\/6-311+G(3df)) show that the structural units in [O2SSSSO2](2-) are joined by the interaction of electrons in two mutually perpendicular \u03c0* SOMOs of the triplet-state diradical S2 with unpaired electrons in the \u03c0*-antibonding orbitals of the two terminal [SO2](\u2022-) and polarized to delocalize the negative charge equally onto the three fragments. Thermodynamic estimates show 2 to be stable with respect to loss of sulfur and formation of 1, in contrast to [O2SSSSO2](2-) salts of small cations that are unstable toward the related dissociation. Reaction of TDAE with an excess of liquid SO2 led to (TDAE)(O3SOSO3)\u00b7SO2 (preliminary X-ray, Raman), (TDAE)(O3SSSSO3)\u00b72SO2 (preliminary X-ray, Raman), and (TDAE)(O3SSO2) (Raman).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Pablo Bruna","Andreas Decken","Scott Greer","Friedrich Grein","H.
