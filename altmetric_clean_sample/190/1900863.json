Many theoretical and methodological approaches to solving this problem have been attempted from different disciplines. My past work has focused on homicide violence from the perspective of social medicine. In this article I present the main conceptual and methodological aspects and the chief findings of my research over the past 15 years. Findings include a quantitative description of the current situation and the introduction of the category of explanatory contexts as a contribution to the study of Colombian violence. The complexity and severity of this problem demand greater theoretical discussion, more plans for action and a faster transition between the two. Social medicine may make a growing contribution to this field.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221a","authors":["Saul Franco"],"first_seen_on":"2013-11-12T20:47:10+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"12","journal":"American Journal of Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1384289048,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1448146\/pdf\/0932032.pdf"],"pmid":"14652328","pubdate":"2003-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Public Health Association","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2032","title":"A Social-Medical Approach to Violence in Colombia","type":"article","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/socialmedical-approach-violence-colombia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3066976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":944895,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102939,"mean":7.7103229322507,"rank":68724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":21746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102939,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4307,"mean":10.334290757083,"rank":3558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4307,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199,"mean":19.836757575758,"rank":169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
