This unit describes the application of the method of singular value decomposition to the analysis of 3D melting data obtained for G-quadruplex structures, and how the results of such an analysis can be used to provide a more complete characterization of the mechanism of quadruplex unfolding.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd37","authors":["Gray, Robert D.","Chaires, Jonathan B."],"doi":"10.1002\/0471142700.nc1704s45","endpage":"17.4.16","first_seen_on":"2013-11-15T15:06:44+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1934-9289","1934-9270"],"journal":"Current protocols in nucleic acid chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1384527952,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/0471142700.nc1704s45\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/0471142700.nc1704s45\/pdf","pmid":"21638271","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"17.4.1","subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","biochemistry"],"title":"Analysis of Multidimensional G-Quadruplex Melting Curves","type":"article","volume":"Chapter 17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-multidimensional-gquadruplex-melting-curves"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628259,"mean":4.9430875566221,"rank":2904113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628259,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95793,"mean":7.64355374144,"rank":75848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95793,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.875,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
