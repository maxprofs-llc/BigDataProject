Between 1 and 3 years of age, the blood flow shows a right hemispheric predominance, mainly due to the activity in the posterior associative area. Asymmetry shifts to the left after 3 years. The subsequent time course of changes appear to follow the emergence of functions localized initially on the right, but later on the left hemisphere (i.e. visuospatial and later language abilities). These findings support the hypothesis that, in man, the right hemisphere develops its functions earlier than the left.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000242e","authors":["O Dulac"],"doi":"10.1093\/brain\/120.6.1057","first_seen_on":"2013-11-12T17:08:35+00:00","issns":["1460-2156"],"journal":"Brain: A Journal of Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1384276056,"links":["http:\/\/brain.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/120\/6\/1057.full.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/brain.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/120\/6\/1057.full.pdf","pmid":"9217688","pubdate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["brain","neurology"],"title":"The right brain hemisphere is dominant in human infants.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/right-brain-hemisphere-dominant-human-infants"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628302,"mean":4.942517914036,"rank":2017431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":935523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628302,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96317,"mean":7.65190830184,"rank":49782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":25845,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96317,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2545,"mean":8.0214481132075,"rank":1699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2545,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":14.272210526316,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Ph.
