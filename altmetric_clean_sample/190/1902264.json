The treatment of morbid obesity can be effectively done by bariatric surgery. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of changes in food intake on body composition and some hematologic and biochemical variables in the period of eight weeks after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The study included 22 women submitted to RYGB. We evaluated anthropometric, nutritional, hematologic and biochemical variables before and 14, 28, 42 and 56 days after surgery. The patients showed a decrease in caloric intake and hence macro- and micronutrients, with significant loss of weight and decrease in body mass index (BMI). Decreases in body weight and BMI were associated with reduced blood levels of total cholesterol, VLDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides and glucose with time after surgery. The decrease in caloric intake was also associated with decreased intake of protein, iron and calcium, with a decline in hemoglobin, hematocrit and red blood count, and RDW increased after surgery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5303cf058f6100042bf","authors":["V Cust\u00f3dio Afonso Rocha","L Ramos de Arvelos","G Pereira Felix","D Nogueira Prado de Souza","M Bernardino Neto","E Santos Resende","N Penha-Silva"],"doi":"10.3305\/nh.2012.27.4.5812","first_seen_on":"2013-11-13T11:06:00+00:00","issns":["1699-5198"],"issue":"4","journal":"Nutricion Hospitalaria","last_mentioned_on":1384340627,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23165553?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23165553","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Grupo Aula M\u00e9dica Ediciones","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Evolution of nutritional, hematologic and biochemical changes in obese women during 8 weeks after Roux-en-Y gastric bypasss.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evolution-nutritional-hematologic-biochemical-changes-obese-women-during-8-weeks-after-rouxeny-gastr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4655094,"mean":5.6505438971925,"rank":3894606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4655094,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103659,"mean":7.9457113970944,"rank":84810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103659,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":827,"mean":1.5544358353511,"rank":423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":827,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.92142857142857,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
