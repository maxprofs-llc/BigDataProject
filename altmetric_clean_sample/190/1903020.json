We designed a phase I study of azacitidine (a direct DNMT inhibitor) plus bortezomib in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to determine safety and tolerability. Twenty-three adults with relapsed\/refractory AML received azacitidine 75 mg\/m(2) daily on days 1-7. Bortezomib was dose escalated from 0.7 mg\/m(2) on days 2 and 5 to 1.3 mg\/m(2) on days 2, 5, 9 and 12. The target dose was reached without dose limiting toxicities. Infection and\/or febrile neutropenia were frequent. Patients received a median of 2 cycles of therapy (range, 1-12+). Five of 23 patients achieved remission, including two with morphologic and cytogenetic complete response (CR) and three with CR and incomplete count recovery (CRi). Of CR\/CRi responders with cytogenetic abnormalities at baseline, three of four achieved cytogenetic CR. The combination of azacitidine and bortezomib was tolerable and active in this cohort of poor-risk previously treated patients with AML.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004181","authors":["Alison R Walker","Rebecca B Klisovic","Ramiro Garzon","Larry J Schaaf","Kristina Humphries","Steven M Devine","John C Byrd","Michael R Grever","Guido Marcucci","William Blum","Walker AR","Klisovic RB","Garzon R","Schaaf LJ","Humphries K","Devine SM","Byrd JC","Grever MR","Marcucci G","Blum W"],"doi":"10.3109\/10428194.2013.833333","endpage":"1308","first_seen_on":"2013-11-13T16:04:46+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1029-2403","1042-8194"],"issue":"6","journal":"Leukemia & Lymphoma","last_mentioned_on":1384358656,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23952243","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23952243\/"],"pmid":"23952243","pubdate":"2013-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1304","subjects":["neoplasms","hematology"],"title":"Phase I study of azacitidine and bortezomib in adults with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phase-i-study-azacitidine-bortezomib-adults-relapsed-refractory-acute-myeloid-leukemia-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7291872,"mean":6.3686968304809,"rank":5247962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1787581,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7291872,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142735,"mean":6.9022681071085,"rank":81296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":53744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142735,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1003,"mean":1.9427085828343,"rank":555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1003,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":0.86764705882353,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
