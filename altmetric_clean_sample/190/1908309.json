IL-21 is produced by activated CD4(+) T cells, NKT cells, and Th17 cells and has pleiotropic actions on a range of lymphoid lineages. IL-21 regulates immunoglobulin production and drives B cell terminal differentiation into plasma cells, cooperatively expands CD8(+) T cells and drives Th17 differentiation, has inhibitory effects on antigen presentation by dendritic cells, and can be pro-apoptotic for B and NK cells. Moreover, IL-21 has potent anti-tumor effects and is implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases. Regulating IL-21 actions in vivo therefore has clinical potential for a range of diseases and is an area of active investigation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a4","authors":["Rosanne Spolski","Warren J.
