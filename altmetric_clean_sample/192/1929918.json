They filled the void for large-scale, nationally representative, publicly available datasets on the out-of-pocket costs, prevalence, and reasons for use of complementary medicine in the U.S. Despite their wide use, this is the first article describing the multi-faceted and largely qualitative processes undertaken to develop the surveys. We hope this in-depth description enables policy makers and researchers to better judge the content validity and utility of the questionnaires and their resultant publications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b0","authors":["Barbara J Stussman","Christina D Bethell","Caroline Gray","Richard L Nahin"],"doi":"10.1186\/1472-6882-13-328","first_seen_on":"2013-11-25T06:03:50+00:00","issns":["1472-6882"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1429232955,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6882\/13\/328\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6882\/13\/328"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6882-13-328.pdf","pmid":"24267412","pubdate":"2013-11-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"328","subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Development of the adult and child complementary medicine questionnaires fielded on the National Health Interview Survey","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-adult-child-complementary-medicine-questionnaires-fielded-national-health-interview-surv-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":2055388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2956002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127232,"mean":7.2945727849347,"rank":42844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":83611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127232,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1552,"mean":5.0176299161831,"rank":625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":922,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1552,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":3.8428641975309,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
