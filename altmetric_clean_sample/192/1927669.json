For biosensors this protein functional optimization will increase the biosensor's sensitivity and\/or selectivity. However, the strategy chosen for the immobilization of the proteins to the sensor surface might be equally important for the development of sensor surfaces that are optimally biologically active. Several studies published in recent years show that the oriented immobilization of the bioactive molecules improves the sensor's properties. In this review, we discuss the state of the art of the different protein immobilization strategies that are commonly used today with a special focus on biosensor applications. These strategies include nonspecific immobilization techniques either by physical adsorption, by covalent coupling, or by specific immobilization via site-specifically introduced tags or bio-orthogonal chemistry. The different tags and bio-orthogonal chemistry available and the techniques to site-specifically introduce these groups in proteins are also discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c4a","authors":["Erik Steen Redeker","Duy Tien Ta","David Cortens","Brecht Billen","Wanda Guedens","Peter Adriaensens"],"doi":"10.1021\/bc4002823","endpage":"1777","first_seen_on":"2013-11-23T17:02:55+00:00","issns":["1043-1802","1520-4812"],"issue":"11","journal":"Bioconjugate Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1385226142,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/bc4002823"],"pmid":"24160176","pubdate":"2013-11-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1761","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Protein Engineering For Directed Immobilization","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protein-engineering-directed-immobilization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3066903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":944853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117095,"mean":7.0817113430238,"rank":77099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":26426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117095,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":501,"mean":1.815252,"rank":320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":501,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":5.760375,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":24,"Student  > Ph.
