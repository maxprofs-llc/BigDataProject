To this end, synthetic biologists have adopted approaches originating from the traditionally non-biological fields of Nonlinear Dynamics and Systems & Control Theory. However, due to the complex molecular interactions affecting the emergent properties of biological systems, mechanistic descriptions of even the simplest genetic circuits (transcriptional feedback oscillators, bi-stable switches) produced by these methods tend to be either oversimplified, or numerically intractable. More comprehensive and realistic models can be approximated by constructing \"toy\" genetic circuits that provide the experimenter with some degree of control over the transcriptional dynamics, and allow for experimental set-ups that generate reliable data reflecting the intracellular biochemical state in real time. To this end, we designed two genetic circuits (basic and tunable) capable of exhibiting synchronized oscillatory green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in small populations of Escherichia coli cells. The functionality of the basic circuit was verified microscopically. High-level visualizations of computational simulations were analyzed to determine whether the reliability and utility of a synchronized transcriptional oscillator could be enhanced by the introduction of chemically inducible repressors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000845","doi":"10.1186\/1754-1611-7-26","first_seen_on":"2013-11-23T10:45:02+00:00","issns":["1754-1611"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Biological Engineering","last_mentioned_on":1385053429,"links":["http:\/\/www.jbioleng.org\/content\/7\/1\/26\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbioleng.org\/content\/pdf\/1754-1611-7-26.pdf","pmid":"24245660","pubdate":"2013-11-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"26","title":"Design and analysis of a tunable synchronized oscillator","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/design-analysis-tunable-synchronized-oscillator"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":4203054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126015,"mean":7.189208373673,"rank":101759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126015,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":5.4177831325301,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.3125,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
