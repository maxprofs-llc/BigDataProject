The identification of subtypes with different clinical behavior and the possibility of using targeted therapy in specific subgroup of patients (eg, those with tumors overexpressing HER2) raise expectations for increasing personalization of treatment. However, there is a widening gap between scientific discoveries and practical application in everyday practice: too many patients are still being managed based only on traditional clinical and pathologic parameters, because of lack of access to up to date technology-such as gene profiling, or cell proliferation assays-in many cancer centers in the United Kingdom. In this article, we provide some examples of this contrast, drawn from the literature and from our own clinical experience in South West Wales, and discuss possible solutions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a9e","doi":"10.1097\/pai.0b013e3182916063","first_seen_on":"2013-11-21T05:32:07+00:00","issns":["1062-3345"],"issue":"6","journal":"Applied Immunohistochemistry & Molecular Morphology","last_mentioned_on":1384965409,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/appliedimmunohist\/Abstract\/2013\/12000\/Biomarkers_in_the_Management_of_Breast_Cancer__.1.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/appliedimmunohist\/2013\/12000\/Biomarkers_in_the_Management_of_Breast_Cancer__.1.pdf","pmid":"24220569","pubdate":"2013-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"481","title":"Biomarkers in the Management of Breast Cancer: Great Expectations, Hard Times","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biomarkers-management-breast-cancer-great-expectations-hard-times-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636227,"mean":4.9205935445202,"rank":2901471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78411,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636227,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107936,"mean":7.0031220642056,"rank":84123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107936,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166,"mean":0.95606060606061,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/memoalexlope\/status\/403200267790737408","license":"public","citation_ids":[1921267],"posted_on":"2013-11-20T16:36:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Guillermo Lopez C","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1511285875\/45150_485611673153_796953153_6804721_3991610_n_normal.jpg","description":"M\u00e9dico Anatomopatologo.
