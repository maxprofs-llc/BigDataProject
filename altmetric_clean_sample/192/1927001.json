The classic phenotypic profile is one defined by CD4+ T cells showing a reduction in the expression of CD7 and CD62L. There are 3 previous reports describing CD20 expression in MF. The cell surface antigen CD20 is a transmembrane glycosylated phosphoprotein expressed in the early stages of B-cell development before differentiation into plasma cells. Two male patients, aged 14 and 44 years, presented with persistent truncal plaques up to 8 cm of 1 and 4 years duration, respectively. A third patient, an 80-year-old female, presented with a 1-year history of progressive nodules involving the head and neck area. Cases 1 and 2 both responded to topical treatment modalities. The biopsies in cases 1 and 2 showed features typical of plaque stage MF, whereas case 3 was compatible with follicular MF with tumor stage transformation. Phenotypically, the aberrant cell populace demonstrated a CD4+, CD7-, and CD62L- phenotype; at variance with classic MF was the expression of CD20. Although there were a few PAX5-positive staining cells, definitive colocalization studies were negative. Other B-cell markers and heavy chain immunoglobulin rearrangement were not detected. There are a growing number of reports describing T-cell lymphomas and leukemias with CD20 expression. Of the 6 CD20+ MF cases reported in the literature to date, 3 have been associated with a more aggressive clinical course; all but one case have occurred in males.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6083cf058f610006970","doi":"10.1097\/dad.0b013e31827b9450","first_seen_on":"2013-11-23T10:25:15+00:00","issns":["0193-1091"],"issue":"8","journal":"The American Journal of Dermatopathology","last_mentioned_on":1387411200,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/amjdermatopathology\/Fulltext\/2013\/12000\/CD20__Mycosis_Fungoides___A_Report_of_Three_Cases.9.aspx","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/DAD.0b013e31827b9450"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/amjdermatopathology\/2013\/12000\/CD20__Mycosis_Fungoides___A_Report_of_Three_Cases.9.pdf","pmid":"24247573","pubdate":"2013-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"833","subjects":["pathology","dermatology"],"title":"CD20+ Mycosis Fungoides","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cd20-mycosis-fungoides"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6237119,"mean":5.9603333186917,"rank":2740291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3329356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6237119,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135562,"mean":7.1894459320897,"rank":59714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":71154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135562,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":598,"mean":1.306338358459,"rank":185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":598,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.73571428571429,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/718182131","license":"public","citation_ids":[1927001],"posted_on":"2013-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["confirmation","good_for_teaching"],"f1000_score":"2"}],"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/memoalexlope\/status\/404114493224927232","license":"public","citation_ids":[1927001],"posted_on":"2013-11-23T05:09:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Guillermo Lopez C","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1511285875\/45150_485611673153_796953153_6804721_3991610_n_normal.jpg","description":"M\u00e9dico Anatomopatologo.
