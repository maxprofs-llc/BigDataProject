Nevertheless, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its pathological actions, especially in the sporadic forms of the diseases, are not completely understood. Intriguingly, several epidemiological and animal model studies have revealed a link between certain microbial infections and the onset or progression of sporadic forms of these neurodegenerative disorders. In this work, we have characterized the effect of toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation on primary murine microglial cultures and analysed the impact of priming cells with extracellular wild-type (Wt) \u03b1Syn on the subsequent TLR stimulation of cells with a set of TLR ligands. By assaying key interleukins and chemokines we report that specific stimuli, in particular Pam3Csk4 (Pam3) and single-stranded RNA40 (ssRNA), can differentially affect the TLR2\/1- and TLR7-mediated responses of microglia when pre-conditioned with \u03b1Syn by augmenting IL-6, MCP-1\/CCL2 or IP-10\/CXCL10 secretion levels. Furthermore, we report a skewing of \u03b1Syn-primed microglia stimulated with ssRNA (TLR7) or Pam3 (TLR2\/1) towards intermediate but at the same time differential, M1\/M2 phenotypes. Finally, we show that the levels and intracellular location of activated caspase-3 protein change significantly in \u03b1Syn-primed microglia after stimulation with these particular TLR agonists. Overall, we report a remarkable impact of non-aggregated \u03b1Syn pre-sensitization of microglia on TLR-mediated immunity, a phenomenon that could contribute to triggering the onset of sporadic \u03b1-synuclein-related neuropathologies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Cintia Roodveldt","Adahir Labrador-Garrido","Elena Gonzalez-Rey","Christian C.
