The recent data on vitamin D from experimental, ecological, case-control, retrospective and prospective observational studies, as well as smaller intervention studies, are significant and confirm the sunshine vitamin's essential role in a variety of physiological and preventative functions. The results of these studies justify the recommendation to improve the general vitamin D status in children and adults by means of a healthy approach to sunlight exposure, consumption of foods containing vitamin D and supplementation with vitamin D preparations. In general, closer attention should therefore be paid to vitamin D deficiency in medical and pharmaceutical practice than has been the case hitherto.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbfd","authors":["Uwe Gr\u00f6ber","J\u00f6rg Spitz","J\u00f6rg Reichrath","Klaus Kisters","Michael F Holick","Gr\u00f6ber U","Spitz J","Reichrath J","Kisters K","Holick MF"],"doi":"10.4161\/derm.26738","first_seen_on":"2013-11-22T17:31:45+00:00","issns":["1938-1980","1938-1972"],"issue":"3","journal":"Dermato-Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1461262331,"links":["https:\/\/www.landesbioscience.com\/journals\/dermatoendocrinology\/article\/26738\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3908963\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24516687","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.4161\/derm.26738","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.4161\/derm.26738","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.4161\/derm.26738?hootPostID=640f1f5bbda3d8d788d0bbfc771212c7","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.4161\/derm.26738?hootPostID=308b9c560170d0694d96f07334291146","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.4161\/derm.26738?hootPostID=3add0526ff0a91a9fc4365b1f6989d00","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4161\/derm.26738"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.landesbioscience.com\/journals\/dermatoendocrinology\/2013DE0245R.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3908963","pmid":"24516687","pubdate":"2013-11-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","title":"Vitamin D","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitamin-d-update-2013-rickets-prophylaxis-general-preventive-healthcare"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7934778,"mean":6.7095405771269,"rank":942238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":6990549,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7934778,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168945,"mean":6.5739447627618,"rank":20241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":148653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168945,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":14.084864,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":12,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":12,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
