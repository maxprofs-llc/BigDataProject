However, the underlying mechanism by which GB prevents ischemic cell death remains unclear. Lysosomal proteases, including cathepsins B and L, have been implicated in ischemic cell death following reperfusion. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the role of GB with respect to cathepsin-mediated cell death following I\/R. Both the expression and enzymatic activity of cathepsins B and L were significantly increased in the ischemic cortex following cerebral I\/R injury. We found that GB treatment markedly decreased the activity and expression of cathepsins B and L following I\/R. Moreover, GB reduced necrotic and apoptotic cell death following I\/R. These data strongly suggest that GB prevents cathepsin-mediated cell death following focal cerebral I\/R injury, and they might provide new insights into the mechanism of the neuroprotective effects of GB.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082af","doi":"10.1097\/wnr.0000000000000096","first_seen_on":"2013-11-22T10:43:50+00:00","issns":["0959-4965"],"issue":"","journal":"NeuroReport","last_mentioned_on":1385117001,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/neuroreport\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Ginkgolide_B_prevents_cathepsin_mediated_cell.99159.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/neuroreport\/9000\/00000\/Ginkgolide_B_prevents_cathepsin_mediated_cell.99159.pdf","pmid":"24264075","pubdate":"2013-11-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Ginkgolide B prevents cathepsin-mediated cell death following cerebral ischemia\/reperfusion injury","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ginkgolide-b-prevents-cathepsinmediated-cell-death-following-cerebral-ischemiareperfusion-injury"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3065527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":944073,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116377,"mean":7.0881591049704,"rank":76064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":26042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116377,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1282,"mean":2.8892146760343,"rank":739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1282,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":1.2,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroReport\/status\/403836091066630144","license":"public","citation_ids":[1924830],"posted_on":"2013-11-22T10:43:21+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroReport","url":"http:\/\/www.neuroreport.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/826084196036857861\/YhtvNa9Z_normal.jpg","description":"NeuroReport is a channel for rapid communication of new findings in neuroscience.","id_on_source":"NeuroReport","tweeter_id":"482085355","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":944},"tweet_id":"403836091066630144"}]}}
