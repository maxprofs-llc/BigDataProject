EMG driven models and optimization algorithms have also been presented in the literature in efforts to estimate skeletal muscle forces and evaluate their possible contribution to the residual muscle moment. Additionally, skeletal muscle-tendon forces have been measured, directly, in both animals and humans. The purpose of this investigation was to calculate the moment produced by the triceps surae muscles and compare it to the residual muscle moment at the ankle during cycling at three power outputs (90, 180 and 270 W). Inferences were made regarding the potential contribution made by each triceps surae component to the tendon force using EMG and muscle-tendon length changes. A buckle-type transducer was surgically implanted on the right Achilles tendon of one male subject. Achilles tendon forces measured in vivo were multiplied by their corresponding moment arms to yield the triceps surae moment during the three working conditions. Moment arm lengths were obtained in a separate experiment using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Pedal reaction forces, body segment accelerations (determined from high speed film), and appropriate mass parameters served as input to the inverse solution. The triceps surae moment was temporally in phase with and consistently represented approximately 65% of the residual muscle moment at the ankle. These data demonstrate the feasibility of using implanted transducers in human subjects and provide a greater understanding of musculoskeletal mechanics during normal human movements.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002ccf","authors":["R J Gregor","P V Komi","R C Browning","M J\u00e4rvinen"],"first_seen_on":"2013-11-23T15:58:28+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0021-9290"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Biomechanics","last_mentioned_on":1385222274,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2050705"],"pmid":"2050705","pubdate":"1991-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"A comparison of the triceps surae and residual muscle moments at the ankle during cycling.","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-triceps-surae-residual-muscle-moments-ankle-during-cycling"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3065470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":944050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117096,"mean":7.0853729877453,"rank":76561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":26208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117096,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":833,"mean":2.3702716346154,"rank":495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":833,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.3753333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
