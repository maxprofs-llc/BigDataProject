A triazolopyrimidine series was deprioritized due to delayed inhibition of parasite growth. A lactic acid series has derivatives with IC50 < 500 nM in a standard Plasmodium falciparum in vitro whole cell assay (Pf assay) but shows half-lives of < 30 min in both human and murine microsomes. Compound 19, from a series of cyclopropyl carboxamides, is a highly potent in vitro inhibitor of P. falciparum (IC50 = 3 nM) and has an oral bioavailability of 55% in CD-1 mice and an ED90 of 20 mg\/kg after oral dosing in a nonmyelo-depleted P. falciparum murine model.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006815","authors":["Lourdes Rueda","Isabel Castellote","Julia Castro-Pichel","Maria J.
