One non-invasive method for positive identification may be the use of a pacemaker programmer to detect and obtain data from pacemakers recovered from unidentified remains. To test the usefulness of this method, this investigation examined the efficiency and utility of 5 different pacemaker programmers in the positive identification of victims of the March 2011 tsunami in Japan at 8 disaster sites in May 2011. On scanning 148 sets of remains, data were successfully obtained from 1 implant in 1 set of remains, allowing for the rapid positive identification of the individual. Scanning pacemakers with pacemaker programmers can be a non-invasive method of positive identification that meets Japanese legal and institutional requirements, but this method is ineffective without a preceding whole-body X-ray scan.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5253cf058f610003c99","authors":["Haruka Makinae","Norio Numata","Hirofumi Kitaoka","Masao Daimon","Taira Yamamoto","Atsushi Amano"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12024-013-9432-8","first_seen_on":"2013-11-23T17:22:48+00:00","issns":["1556-2891"],"issue":"4","journal":"Forensic Science, Medicine & Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1385227319,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23592022"],"pmid":"23592022","pubdate":"2013-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Criminology & Criminal Justice","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Forensic Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pathology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine","pathology","jurisprudence"],"title":"Use of pacemaker programmers for disaster victim identification.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pacemaker-programmers-disaster-victim-identification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635048,"mean":4.9225817734301,"rank":2018161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635048,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108804,"mean":6.9506001856569,"rank":54416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":30715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108804,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":3.4612857142857,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":4.5625,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
