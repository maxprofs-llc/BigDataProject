Typhimurium) is one of the most frequent causes of foodborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis. Between 2005-2008 a series of S. Typhimurium outbreaks occurred in Tasmania, Australia, that were all traced to eggs originating from a single chicken farm. We sequenced the genomes of 12 isolates linked to these outbreaks, in order to investigate the microevolution of a pathogenic S. Typhimurium clone in a natural, spatiotemporally restricted population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Jane Hawkey","David J Edwards","Karolina Dimovski","Lester Hiley","Helen Billman-Jacobe","Geoff Hogg","Kathryn E Holt","Hawkey J","Edwards DJ","Dimovski K","Hiley L","Billman-Jacobe H","Hogg G","Holt KE"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-14-800","first_seen_on":"2013-11-22T06:28:50+00:00","handle":"11343\/41044","handles":["11343\/41044"],"issns":["1471-2164",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1395326806,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24245509","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/14\/800","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2164-14-800"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/1471-2164-14-800?site=bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"24245509","pubdate":"2013-11-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"800","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Evidence of microevolution of Salmonella Typhimurium during a series of egg-associated outbreaks linked to a single chicken farm.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2164-14-800","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidence-microevolution-salmonella-typhimurium-during-series-eggassociated-outbreaks-linked-single-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7528769,"mean":6.5067992380654,"rank":3441138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3918351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7528769,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166000,"mean":6.5257063837736,"rank":62294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":98700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166000,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5494,"mean":4.0616453668305,"rank":2901,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":2332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5494,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203,"mean":4.3720297029703,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
