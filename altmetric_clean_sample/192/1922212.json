Nonhealing wounds frequently require the use of physical modalities to achieve healing. There is much debate over which treatment modality to use, with varying clinical results in the literature. This review paper describes a common biochemical pathway that helps the clinician understand, at a molecular level, how the transference of energy to a wound can result in positive clinical results. The mechanisms of action for ultraviolet light, electrical stimulation, and ultrasound are reviewed along with a proposed biochemical roadmap. An emphasis on protein biochemistry is supported with an extensive review of the literature.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002580","authors":["William J.
