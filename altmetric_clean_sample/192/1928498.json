However serious bacterial illness, chronic inflammatory conditions and mental health problems are repeatedly missed with significant morbidity, mortality, financial and social implications. A conceptual framework detailing the mechanism of effective Safety Netting has yet to be described however and there is increasing evidence parents want guidance on when to seek medical advice (a key part of safety netting) prior to initial consultation. This article explores current understanding of safety netting in relation to child health and argues there is a need to develop a more standardised approach.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002303","authors":["Damian Roland","Caroline Jones","Sarah Neill","Matthew Thompson","Monica Lakhanpaul","Roland D","Jones C","Neill S","Thompson M","Lakhanpaul M"],"doi":"10.1136\/archdischild-2012-303056","endpage":"53","first_seen_on":"2013-11-24T08:27:21+00:00","funders":["dohuk"],"issns":["1743-0593","1743-0585"],"issue":"2","journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood -- Education & Practice Edition","last_mentioned_on":1490728821,"links":["http:\/\/ep.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2013\/10\/28\/archdischild-2012-303056.abstract","http:\/\/ep.bmj.com\/content\/99\/2\/48.abstract","http:\/\/m.ep.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2013\/10\/28\/archdischild-2012-303056.abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24164728\/","http:\/\/ep.bmj.com\/content\/99\/2\/48","http:\/\/epbeta.bmj.com\/content\/99\/2\/48","http:\/\/ep.bmj.com\/content\/99\/2\/48?utm_content=bufferba145&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ep.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2013\/10\/28\/archdischild-2012-303056.full.pdf","pmid":"24164728","pubdate":"2013-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"edpract-2012-303056","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Safety netting in healthcare settings: what it means, and for whom?","type":"article","volume":"99","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-netting-healthcare-settings-it-means-whom"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.35,"score_history":{"1y":4.2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":839545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7583702,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174389,"mean":6.7838889946558,"rank":17910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":156434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174389,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":355,"mean":4.503406779661,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":355,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":5.4875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":2,"practitioner":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":5,"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
