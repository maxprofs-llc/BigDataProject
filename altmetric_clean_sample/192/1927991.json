As a result, over 100 genes and numerous sequence variants have been identified, providing us with a general characterization of mutations underlying quantitative trait variation. Most quantitative trait alleles exert considerable phenotypic effects and alter conserved amino acid positions within protein coding sequences. When examined, quantitative trait alleles influence the expression of numerous genes, most of which are unrelated to an allele's phenotypic effect. The profile of quantitative trait alleles has proven useful to reverse quantitative genetics approaches and supports the use of systems genetics approaches to synthesize the molecular basis of trait variation across multiple strains.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a3","authors":["Justin C Fay"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gde.2013.10.005","first_seen_on":"2013-11-23T21:30:00+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["0959437X"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Genetics & Development","last_mentioned_on":1385555364,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0959437X13001408"],"pmid":"24269094","pubdate":"2013-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"The molecular basis of phenotypic variation in yeast","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-basis-phenotypic-variation-yeast"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7946957,"mean":6.7146944304146,"rank":4169628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2218185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7946957,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169927,"mean":6.5792325247463,"rank":78325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":70539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169927,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":726,"mean":3.6027365517241,"rank":507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":726,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.9730769230769,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
