Single-crystal X-ray analysis shows that the molecule possesses both Sb\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S and C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S interactions, which results in a supramolecular association in the absence of hydrogen-bonding functionality on the R group. The co-existence in the title compound of such interactions is a unique character of known dimeric antimony(III) alkyl and\/or aryl dithiocarbamate complexes. The literature reveals that the species where the alkyl and\/or aryl dithiocarbamates carry the following groups: R = methyl (chloroform solvated), ethyl, n-propyl, pyrrolidine, morpholine, piperidine, azepane, benzyl, methylphenyl, are not capable of forming significant hydrogen-bonding interactions. However, either Sb\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S or C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S intermolecular interactions dominate between two centrosymmetrically related molecules leading to a supramolecular aggregation. In the species where the R group carries hydrogen-bonding functionality, i.e. 2-hydroxylethyl, the C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S interactions are subverted by O-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonding. In addition, the title compound does not have steric hindrance or any hydrogen-bonding group but is stabilized with the co-existence of Sb\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S and C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S interactions. Analysis of the secondary interactions of a series of analogues previously reported reveals that steric bulk is unnecessary for the mitigation of Sb\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S interactions and for the establishment of C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S secondary bonding.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"57da952eaee83e3eee8b4569","authors":["H.
