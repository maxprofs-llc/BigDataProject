This is characterized by enlarged cell size, flattened morphology, and upregulated senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity. Moreover, the senescence- associated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16(Ink4A) and p21(Cip1) were induced correlating with activation of the G1\/S cell cycle inhibitor retinoblastoma protein and terminal proliferation arrest. The number of cells in the adipose-derived stromal\/progenitor cell population with high adipogenic capacity declined inversely with the increase of senescent cells. Adipogenic hormone cocktail induced expression of the adipogenic key regulators peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b32 and CCAAT\/enhancer-binding protein \u03b1 was significantly reduced in senescent adipose-derived stromal\/ progenitor cells. Furthermore, the expression of the adipogenic differentiation genes fatty acid binding protein-4, adiponectin, and leptin and the formation of fat droplets were impaired. We conclude cellular senescence contributes to dysfunctions in adipose-derived stromal\/progenitor cell replication, adipogenesis, triglyceride storage, and adipokine secretion.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fab","authors":["Maria C Mitterberger","Stefan Lechner","Monika Mattesich","Werner Zwerschke"],"doi":"10.1093\/gerona\/glt043","first_seen_on":"2013-11-23T11:03:38+00:00","issns":["1758-535X"],"journal":"Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1385175420,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23657974"],"pmid":"23657974","pubdate":"2013-05-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Adipogenic Differentiation Is Impaired in Replicative Senescent Human Subcutaneous Adipose-Derived Stromal\/Progenitor Cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adipogenic-differentiation-impaired-replicative-senescent-human-subcutaneous-adiposederived-stromalp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.88,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.88},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630565,"mean":4.929464153233,"rank":510366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3119927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630565,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108586,"mean":6.9704938803705,"rank":17708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":90867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108586,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":783,"mean":5.2889104859335,"rank":164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":783,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":3.7532222222222,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
