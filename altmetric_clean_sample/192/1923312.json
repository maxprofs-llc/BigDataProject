Hippocampal lesions spared both the ability to discriminate two different digging media and to discriminate two different room locations in a go\/no-go task when each location was approached from a single direction. Hippocampal lesions had, however, differential effects on a more complex task (biconditional discrimination) where the correct response was signaled by the presence or absence of specific cues. For all biconditional tasks, digging in one medium (A) was rewarded in the presence of cue C, while digging in medium B was rewarded in the presences of cue D. Such biconditional tasks are \"configural\" as no individual cue or element predicts the solution (AC+, AD-, BD+, and BC-). When proximal context cues signaled the correct digging choice, biconditional learning was seemingly unaffected by hippocampal lesions. Severe deficits occurred, however, when the correct digging choice was signaled by distal room cues. Also, impaired was the ability to discriminate two locations when each location was approached from two directions. A task demand that predicted those tasks impaired by hippocampal damage was the need to combine specific cues with their relative spatial positions (\"structural learning\"). This ability makes it possible to distinguish the same cues set in different spatial arrays. Thus, the hippocampus appears necessary for configural discriminations involving structure, discriminations that potentially underlie the creation of cognitive maps.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f610007635","authors":["Albasser, Mathieu M.","Dumont, Julie R.","Amin, Eman","Holmes, Joshua D.","Horne, Murray R.","Pearce, John M.","Aggleton, John P."],"doi":"10.1002\/hipo.22154","endpage":"1178","first_seen_on":"2013-11-21T22:54:03+00:00","funders":["wellcome","bbsrc"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1098-1063","1050-9631"],"issue":"12","journal":"Hippocampus","last_mentioned_on":1385074437,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/hipo.22154\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/hipo.22154\/pdf","pmid":"23749378","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1162","subjects":["brain"],"title":"Association rules for rat spatial learning: The importance of the hippocampus for binding item identity with item location","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-rules-rat-spatial-learning-importance-hippocampus-binding-item-identity-item-location"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6713246,"mean":6.1608598324636,"rank":4975824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":978834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6713246,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160777,"mean":6.4492884385731,"rank":100389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":32428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160777,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":632,"mean":6.4888938193344,"rank":509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":632,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.1357142857143,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
