Community Health Workers interviewed 668 Hispanic residents in Shelbyville, KY, USA. Data were collected from 2009 to 2010 and analyzed from 2011 until present. Hispanic immigrants from Mexico and other Central American countries completed the survey. The most common self-reported diseases were allergies, asthma, diabetes, lung disease and cardiovascular disease. High blood pressure and diabetes were the two most common diagnoses among insured, older females. Health education, disease prevention and nutrition were the top health concerns among participants. Deficits in health care infrastructure for this largely transient community may compromise their ability to meet health care needs and concerns. Similar issues may be faced by other disadvantaged Hispanic communities in the continental US and likely to be influenced by anticipated provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dee","authors":["Irma N.
