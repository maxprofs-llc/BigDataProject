The genome was amplified with a combination of short and long PCRs that were subjected to 454 sequencing. The mitogenome of M. ignea is a circular molecule of 15,333bp in size and encodes the 37 genes typically found in metazoans, and one non-coding region. The order of the genes is the same as for all the other Heteronemerteans. All genes are encoded on the heavy strand except trnT and trnP. The phylogenetic analyses recovered M. ignea as a basal taxon in the Lineidae family, no differences were found in the topology of the phylogenetic trees in comparison with previous studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f6100080c9","authors":["Jaime Gonzalez-Cueto","Mayron E Escarraga-Fajardo","Ana M Lagos","Sigmer Quiroga","Lyda R Castro"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.margen.2015.01.003","first_seen_on":"2015-01-27T13:56:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1876-7478"],"journal":"Marine Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1422366959,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25620494?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25620494","pubdate":"2015-01-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","genetics"],"title":"The complete mitochondrial genome of Micrura ignea Schwartz & Norenburg 2005 (Nemertea: Heteronemertea) and comparative analysis with other nemertean mitogenomes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-mitochondrial-genome-micrura-ignea-schwartz-norenburg-2005-nemertea-heteronemertea-comparat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4669204,"mean":5.6775783798666,"rank":2460296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":2188635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4669204,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160855,"mean":8.7478611784601,"rank":83534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":76346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160855,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155,"mean":1.6617012987013,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.8163333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
