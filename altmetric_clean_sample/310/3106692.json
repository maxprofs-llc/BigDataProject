Despite the ability to fully target \u03b11S into triadic junctions and tetradic arrays, the neuronal isoform \u03b23 was unable to restore considerable charge movement (measure of \u03b11S voltage sensing) upon expression in \u03b21-null zebrafish relaxed myotubes, unlike the other three vertebrate \u03b2-isoforms (\u03b21a, \u03b22a, and \u03b24). Thus, we used \u03b23 for chimerization with \u03b21a to investigate whether any of the five distinct molecular regions of \u03b21a is dominantly involved in inducing the voltage-sensing function of \u03b11S. Surprisingly, systematic domain swapping between \u03b21a and \u03b23 revealed a pivotal role of the src homology 3 (SH3) domain and C terminus of \u03b21a in charge movement restoration. More interestingly, \u03b21a SH3 domain and C terminus, when simultaneously engineered into \u03b23 sequence background, were able to fully restore charge movement together with proper intracellular Ca(2+) release, suggesting cooperativity of these two domains in induction of the \u03b11S voltage-sensing function in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling. Furthermore, substitution of a proline by alanine in the putative SH3-binding polyproline motif in the proximal C terminus of \u03b21a (also of \u03b22a and \u03b24) fully obstructed \u03b11S charge movement. Consequently, we postulate a model according to which \u03b2 subunits, probably via the SH3-C-terminal polyproline interaction, adapt a discrete conformation required to modify the \u03b11S conformation apt for voltage sensing in skeletal muscle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Anamika Dayal","Vinayakumar Bhat","Clara Franzini-Armstrong","Manfred Grabner","Dayal A","Bhat V","Franzini-Armstrong C","Grabner M"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1301087110","endpage":"7493","first_seen_on":"2015-01-27T07:39:58+00:00","funders":["nhlbi","fwf"],"issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"issue":"18","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1421884800,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.1301087110"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/110\/18\/7488.full.pdf","pmid":"23589859","pubdate":"2013-04-29T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"7488","subjects":["science"],"title":"Domain cooperativity in the \u03b21a subunit is essential for dihydropyridine receptor voltage sensing in skeletal muscle","type":"article","volume":"110","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/domain-cooperativity-%CE%B21a-subunit-essential-dihydropyridine-receptor-voltage-sensing-skeletal-muscle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4763787,"mean":5.4965507147287,"rank":2463539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1671238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4763787,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160431,"mean":8.6619725238423,"rank":83756,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":56918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160431,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38307,"mean":16.61417971075,"rank":26737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":5416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38307,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":967,"mean":43.057161490683,"rank":781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":967,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
