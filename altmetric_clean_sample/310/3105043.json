The mechanisms causing these changes have remained unclear. We demonstrated recently that peritoneal macrophages stimulated with interleukin 4 + interleukin 13 produce arginase I, which decreases the expression of the T-cell receptor CD3zeta chain and impairs T-cell responses. Using a 3LL murine lung carcinoma model we tested whether arginase I was produced in the tumor microenvironment and could decrease CD3zeta expression and impair T-cell function. The results show that a subpopulation of mature tumor-associated myeloid cells express high levels of arginase I, whereas tumor cells and infiltrating lymphocytes do not. Arginase I expression in the tumor was seen on day 7 after tumor injection. Tumor-associated myeloid cells also expressed high levels of cationic amino acid transporter 2B, which allowed them to rapidly incorporate L-Arginine (L-Arg) and deplete extracellular L-Arg in vitro. L-Arg depletion by tumor-associated myeloid cells blocked the re-expression of CD3zeta in stimulated T cells and inhibited antigen-specific proliferation of OT-1 and OT-2 cells. The injection of the arginase inhibitor N-hydroxy-nor-L-Arg blocked growth of s.c. 3LL lung carcinoma in mice. High levels of arginase I were also found in tumor samples of patients with non-small cell carcinoma. Therefore, arginase I production by mature myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment may be a central mechanism for tumor evasion and may represent a target for new therapies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["Rodriguez PC","Quiceno DG","Zabaleta J","Ortiz B","Zea AH","Piazuelo MB","Delgado A","Correa P","Brayer J","Sotomayor EM","Antonia S","Ochoa JB","Ochoa AC"],"doi":"10.1158\/0008-5472.can-04-0465","first_seen_on":"2015-01-26T19:52:02+00:00","issns":["0008-5472"],"issue":"16","journal":"Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1422301809,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15313928"],"pmid":"15313928","pubdate":"2004-08-18T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Arginase I production in the tumor microenvironment by mature myeloid cells inhibits T-cell receptor expression and antigen-specific T-cell responses.","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/arginase-i-production-tumor-microenvironment-mature-myeloid-cells-inhibits-tcell-receptor-expression-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4657843,"mean":5.6528782728159,"rank":3113260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1362525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4657843,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160231,"mean":8.6732269986895,"rank":103895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":49198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160231,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5404,"mean":4.8103672034055,"rank":4329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5404,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":5.7716956521739,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":26,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
