Nowadays, chrysin has become the foremost candidate exhibiting health benefits, owing to its multiple bioactivities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, anti-diabetic, anti-estrogenic, antibacterial and antitumor activities. Anticancer activity is most promising among the multiple pharmacological effects displayed by chrysin. In vitro and in vivo models have shown that chrysin inhibits cancer growth through induction of apoptosis, alteration of cell cycle and inhibition of angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis without causing any toxicity and undesirable side effects to normal cells. Chrysin displays these effects through selective modulation of multiple cell signaling pathways which are linked to inflammation, survival, growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. This broad spectrum of antitumor activity in conjunction with low toxicity underscores the translational value of chrysin in cancer therapy. The present review highlights the chemopreventive and therapeutic effects, molecular targets and antineoplastic mechanisms that contribute to the observed anticancer activity of chrysin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000367d","doi":"10.1016\/j.toxlet.2015.01.008","first_seen_on":"2015-01-26T00:11:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03784274"],"journal":"Toxicology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1422231027,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S037842741500020X"],"pmid":"25596314","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Science And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Chemopreventive and therapeutic potential of chrysin in cancer: mechanistic perspectives ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemopreventive-therapeutic-potential-chrysin-cancer-mechanistic-perspectives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4652878,"mean":5.6496183853583,"rank":3892663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4652878,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160041,"mean":8.684356048488,"rank":128218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160041,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":696,"mean":2.6429410071942,"rank":531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":696,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.80357142857143,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
