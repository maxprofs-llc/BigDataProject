We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, comparative study in Spain of 21 patients who had imported P. ovale curtisi infections and 14 who had imported P. ovale wallikeri infections confirmed by PCR and gene sequencing during June 2005-December 2011. The only significant finding was more severe thrombocytopenia among patients with P. ovale wallikeri infection than among those with P. ovale curtisi infection (p = 0.031). However, we also found nonsignificant trends showing that patients with P. ovale wallikeri infection had shorter time from arrival in Spain to onset of symptoms, lower level of albumin, higher median maximum core temperature, and more markers of hemolysis than did those with P. ovale curtisi infection. Larger, prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027bd","authors":["Rojo-Marcos G","Rubio-Mu\u00f1oz JM","Ram\u00edrez-Olivencia G","Garc\u00eda-Bujalance S","Elcuaz-Romano R","D\u00edaz-Men\u00e9ndez M","Calder\u00f3n M","Garc\u00eda-Bermejo I","Ruiz-Giard\u00edn JM","Merino-Fern\u00e1ndez FJ","Torr\u00fas-Tendero D","Delgado-Iribarren A","Ribell-Bachs M","Ar\u00e9valo-Serrano J","Cuadros-Gonz\u00e1lez J"],"doi":"10.3201\/eid2003.130745","first_seen_on":"2015-01-24T19:20:20+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1080-6040","1080-6059"],"issue":"3","journal":"Emerging Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1422127210,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24572501?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/wwwnc.cdc.gov\/eid\/article\/20\/3\/13-0745_article.htm"],"pmid":"24572501","pubdate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Comparison of Imported Plasmodium ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri Infections among Patients in Spain, 2005-2011.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-imported-plasmodium-ovale-curtisi-p-ovale-wallikeri-infections-among-patients-spain-20052"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6355335,"mean":5.916306700169,"rank":2255851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4058427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6355335,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194156,"mean":8.5128952949964,"rank":67439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":124629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194156,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3196,"mean":6.9196513302034,"rank":1773,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3196,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":26.705898305085,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
