While improvements in several gene delivery methods have been described, transfection remains a capricious process for HESCs, and has not yet been reported in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In this video, we demonstrate how our lab routinely transfects and nucleofects human iPSCs using plasmid with an enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) reporter. Human iPSCs are adapted and maintained as feeder-free cultures to eliminate the possibility of feeder cell transfection and to allow efficient selection of stable transgenic iPSC clones following transfection. For nucleofection, human iPSCs are pre-treated with ROCK inhibitor, trypsinized into small clumps of cells, nucleofected and replated on feeders in feeder cell-conditioned medium to enhance cell recovery. Transgene-expressing human iPSCs can be obtained after 6 hours. Antibiotic selection is applied after 24 hours and stable transgenic lines appear within 1 week. Our protocol is robust and reproducible for human iPSC lines without altering pluripotency of these cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f23","authors":["Papri Chatterjee","Yuri Cheung","Chee Liew"],"doi":"10.3791\/3110","first_seen_on":"2015-01-27T12:49:13+00:00","issns":["1940-087X"],"journal":"Journal of Visualized Experiments","last_mentioned_on":1421941589,"links":["http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/3110?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=youtube_video&utm_campaign=youtube"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jove.com\/pdf\/3110.pdf","pmid":"22006109","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","biology"],"title":"Transfecting and Nucleofecting Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transfecting-nucleofecting-human-induced-pluripotent-stem-cells-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230013,"mean":5.9668566214658,"rank":5294604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230013,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190196,"mean":8.5380940613583,"rank":149883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190196,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3675,"mean":3.0164757757213,"rank":2929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3675,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":3.5416140350877,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
