Materials & methods: miR-331 expression has been analyzed using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 95 bone marrow specimens from newly diagnosed AML patients in comparison with 20 healthy subjects. Results: miR-331 was upregulated in AML patients and its expression seemed to influence remission achieving and death risk. The time of remission duration in patients with complete remission was longer in subjects with miR-331 downregulation after induction chemotherapy. Conclusion: we showed for the first time that miR-331 higher expression appears to be correlated with worse response to therapy and shorter survival of AML patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c71","authors":["Aleksandra Butrym","Justyna Rybka","Dagmara Baczy\u0144ska","Andrzej Tukiendorf","Kazimierz Kuliczkowski","Grzegorz Mazur"],"doi":"10.2217\/bmm.14.112","first_seen_on":"2015-01-27T16:07:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1752-0371"],"journal":"Biomarkers in Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1422375189,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25620533?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25620533","pubdate":"2015-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biochemistry"],"title":"Expression of microRNA-331 can be used as a predictor for response to therapy and survival in acute myeloid leukemia patients.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-microrna331-used-predictor-response-therapy-survival-acute-myeloid-leukemia-patients-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4669204,"mean":5.6775783798666,"rank":3125096,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1363226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4669204,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160855,"mean":8.7477934151468,"rank":104639,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":49065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160855,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189,"mean":2.1747872340426,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.7464285714286,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
