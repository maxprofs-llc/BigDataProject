A total of 60 mercury \"output\" calculations were carried out by the Swiss Material Testing Institute (Empa). The amount of mercury initially present (\"input\") in the dentitions of 54 deceased persons was assessed from their post-mortem dental radiographs and by clinical examination. The correlation between the \"input\" and the \"output\" was 0.93, irrespective of the age at death. However, the \"input\" was calculated to be 1.8 times higher than the \"output\" for the deceased people with amalgam restorations. In the blind study, the difference was 1.3 times. The main source of mercury was undoubtedly the amalgam restorations. The amount of mercury recorded during the cremation of 88% of the deceased people without amalgam restorations was under the accepted level of 200 micrograms\/m3. However, in 3 cases, the amount of mercury was slightly more than 200 micrograms\/m3. In contrast, the amount of mercury recorded during the cremation of only 18% of the deceased people with amalgam restorations was less than the accepted level of 200 micrograms\/m3. The amount of mercury contamination during cremation as a result of amalgam fillings is so low that no additional preventive measures are required at the crematoria.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa91e3cf058f61000d57b","authors":["C Matter-Gr\u00fctter","R Baillod","T Imfeld","F Lutz"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-25T02:43:35+00:00","issns":["0256-2855"],"issue":"8","journal":"Schweizer Monatsschrift f\u00fcr Zahnmedizin Revue mensuelle suisse d odonto stomatologie Rivista mensile svizzera di odontologia e stomatologia","last_mentioned_on":1422153771,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7481688"],"pmid":"7481688","pubdate":"1995-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"[Mercury emission measurements in a crematorium.
