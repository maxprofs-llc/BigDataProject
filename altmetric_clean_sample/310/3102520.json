Diagnostic and epidemiological research aimed at determining the source and means of transmission of dermatophytoses in both humans and animals requires not only species differentiation of isolates but also differentiation within species. The study was conducted on 24 isolates originating in humans and various animal species with clinical symptoms of dermatophytosis. The analysis included phenotypical identification methods and molecular methods: internal transcribed spacer sequencing and ITS-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) with multi-enzyme restriction. ITS sequence analysis identified the isolates to species - Trichophyton interdigitale, Arthroderma benhamiae and A. vanbreuseghemii, and ITS-RFLP detected six different genotypes. Genotypes I, II and III characterised strains belonging to A. benhamiae, genotype IV characterised the A. vanbreuseghemii strain, and genotypes V and VI occurred only within the species T. interdigitale. Strains isolated from guinea pigs were dominant within genotype I, while genotype II was found mainly in strains from foxes. Multi-enzyme restriction analysis of this region enables intraspecific differentiation, which may be useful in epidemiological research, particularly in determining the source of infections.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003140","authors":["Zi\u00f3\u0142kowska, Gra\u017cyna","Nowakiewicz, Aneta","Gnat, Sebastian","Tro\u015bcia\u0144czyk, Aleksandra","Zi\u0119ba, Przemys\u0142aw","Majer Dziedzic, Barbara","Gra\u017cyna Zi\u00f3\u0142kowska","Aneta Nowakiewicz","Sebastian Gnat","Aleksandra Tro\u015bcia\u0144czyk","Przemys\u0142aw Zi\u0119ba","Barbara Majer Dziedzic"],"doi":"10.1111\/myc.12284","endpage":"126","first_seen_on":"2015-01-25T20:18:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1439-0507","0933-7407","09337407"],"issue":"3","journal":"Mycoses","last_mentioned_on":1423914305,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/myc.12284\/abstract;jsessionid=050E4343207C80A154FAA35963AE2648.f03t01","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25643744"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/myc.12284\/pdf","pmid":"25643744","pubdate":"2015-01-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"119","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Molecular identification and classification of Trichophyton mentagrophytes complex strains isolated from humans and selected animal species","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-identification-classification-itrichophyton-mentagrophytesi-complex-strains-isolated-human"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8040368,"mean":6.8299370028724,"rank":5817951,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1937084,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8040368,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239073,"mean":8.1404067979522,"rank":147277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":78954,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239073,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":477,"mean":2.0078739495798,"rank":268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":477,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":0.72857142857143,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"SA":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"IFN-\u03b3 and TNF are not essential parameters of CD4 T cell responses for vaccine control of...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100000382989422\/posts\/803318289716527","license":"public","citation_ids":[3223426,3555161,3919546,3102520,3102522,3211114],"posted_on":"2015-02-14T11:45:05+00:00","summary":"Kindly provide me the papers from the links below to vise.esther@yahoo.com Thank you.\nhttp:\/\/jid.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/01\/30\/infdis.jiv055.abstract\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25667007\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25674584\nhttp","author":{"name":"Esther Vise","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100000382989422","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/100000382989422\/picture","id_on_source":"100000382989422"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DrAlHargan\/status\/559445164570464256","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3102520],"posted_on":"2015-01-25T20:18:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Abdullah AlHargan","url":"http:\/\/DermClub.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/843211137533513729\/FkTX4pEj_normal.jpg","description":"MD.\nDermatology Resident","id_on_source":"DrAlHargan","tweeter_id":"2871641462","geo":{"lt":24.68773,"ln":46.72185,"country":"SA"},"followers":1870},"tweet_id":"559445164570464256"}]}}
