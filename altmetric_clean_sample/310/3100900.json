The addition of 10 and 15 mM nicotinamide, or 6 mM 3-aminobenzamide, to HASMC, for 96 h, resulted in a 19.3%, 44% and 41.5% reduction of cell growth and inhibition of DNA synthesis. Since c-myc protooncogene expression has previously been correlated with cell proliferation, the steady state level of its mRNA was determined in control and treated HSMC by Northern analysis, following a 1 h treatment with the respective chemicals. Whereas c-myc mRNA was suppressed by nicotinamide in proportion to its ability to reduce HASMC growth, down regulation of c-myc by 3-aminobenzamide was much less than the observed antiproliferative effect. These results suggest that the growth regulatory properties of nicotinamide and 3-aminobenzamide in HASMC are probably unrelated to their activity in controlling c-myc gene expression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9193cf058f61000d2a2","authors":["Y Cui","S An","S Jabr","J A Maturana","J M Wu","W H Gutstein"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-24T18:13:43+00:00","issns":["1039-9712"],"issue":"5","journal":"Biochemistry and molecular biology international","last_mentioned_on":1422123131,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8136711"],"pmid":"8136711","pubdate":"1993-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"The anti-proliferative effects of nicotinamide and 3-aminobenzamide on human smooth muscle cells in vitro.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiproliferative-effects-nicotinamide-3aminobenzamide-human-smooth-muscle-cells-vitro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4773711,"mean":5.4974658684639,"rank":3888121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":126083,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4773711,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160402,"mean":8.6513925723656,"rank":127926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":661,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160402,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":3.2625,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"The anti-proliferative effects of nicotinamide and 3-aminobenzamide... - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1121259785\/posts\/796490087098129","license":"public","citation_ids":[3100900],"posted_on":"2015-01-24T18:12:11+00:00","summary":"The addition of 10 and 15 mM nicotinamide, or 6 mM 3-aminobenzamide, to HASMC, for 96 h, resulted in a 19.3%, 44% and 41.5% reduction of cell growth and inhibition of DNA synthesis.
