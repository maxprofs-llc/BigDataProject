The Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA) has the third largest population in the country and has increasing pollution issues. The concentrations of 10 aldehydes and two ketones were measured in the MMA, in the spring and fall of 2011 and 2012. Formaldehyde (16-42 ppbv) was the most abundant carbonyl, followed by acetaldehyde (5-15 ppbv) and acetone (7-15 ppbv). The concentrations showed marked diurnal trends with maximum values between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., when photochemical activity is intense. Thus, secondary production of carbonyls is statistically significant in the city. Biogenic production of several carbonyls, such as 2-butanone, was supported by their mid correlation with solar radiation and low correlation with propionaldehyde, which is mainly emitted by anthropogenic sources. The seasonal variability of the concentrations was observed in the first three samplings, with the highest levels reached in the fall. The rainy conditions during the fourth sampling did not allow comparison. Carbonyl-NOx-O3 analysis was made. Results indicated a carbonyl-sensitive atmosphere, especially during the midday samplings of 10:00 a. m. to 2:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. because of the intense solar radiation during these periods.\nMonitoring of carbonyls in Monterrey, Mexico, was performed to quantify the pollutant concentration in the city's atmosphere. Although primary emission is significantly important, the secondary production of the pollutants, along with ozone production being carbonyl sensitive, indicates that air pollution controls must address the direct sources and the precursors of the pollutants to achieve air quality.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f6100011d8","authors":["H.
