Currently most of DPI formulations rely on lactose as a carrier in the drug powder blend. However, due to reducing sugar function of lactose which makes it incompatible with some drugs such as budesonide, it is realistic to investigate for alternative sugars that would overcome the concerned drawback but still have the positive aspects of lactose.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef762a83ee09648b521c","authors":["Mohammed-Nurul Momin","Atoosa Hedayati","Ali Nokhodchi","Momin, Mohammed-Nurul","Hedayati, Atoosa","Nokhodchi, Ali"],"doi":"10.5681\/bi.2011.014","first_seen_on":"2015-01-27T16:17:50+00:00","issns":["2228-5652"],"issue":"2","journal":"BioImpacts","last_mentioned_on":1422375436,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3648955\/","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5681\/bi.2011.014"],"pmcid":"PMC3648955","pmid":"23678414","pubdate":"2015-01-27T20:11:00+00:00","publisher":"Tabriz University of Medical Sciences","startpage":"105","title":" Investigation into Alternative Sugars as Potential Carriers for Dry Powder Formulation of Budesonide","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/investigation-alternative-sugars-potential-carriers-dry-powder-formulation-budesonide"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4759395,"mean":5.7098541322724,"rank":3982605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4759395,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167625,"mean":8.5586717653799,"rank":134547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167625,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
