Drug resistance, intrinsic or acquired, represents the major cause of failure of novel biological agents. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNAs the bind to partially complementary recognition sequence of mRNA, coming either degradation of mRNA or inhibition of translation. The recent evidences that several micro-RNAs can modulate the oncogenic driver pathways in NSCLC and that they are involved in drug resistance of their targeted inhibitors, have opened the way to new therapeutic strategies. This minireview aims 1) to explore the potential mechanisms by which key miRNAs may up-regulate or down-regulate specific oncogenic driver pathways; 2) highlight the role of microRNAs in the mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies; 3) discuss the therapeutic potential by using short-interfering RNAs or artificial miRNAs as anti-cancer therapies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022b6","authors":["Carmelo Tibaldi","Armida D'Incecco","Alessandro Lagan\u00e0"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-25T05:10:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1875-5992"],"journal":"Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1422480660,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25612681?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25612681"],"pmid":"25612681","pubdate":"2015-01-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["chemistry","antineoplasticagents"],"title":"MicroRNAs and Targeted Therapies in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Minireview.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/micrornas-targeted-therapies-nonsmall-cell-lung-cancer-minireview-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.426,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.426},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4683775,"mean":5.7027612822493,"rank":612941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":4071524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4683775,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161218,"mean":8.7772991309851,"rank":27492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":133723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161218,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272,"mean":1.7846420664207,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.1617647058824,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/status\/559216609072406530","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3101583],"posted_on":"2015-01-25T05:10:04+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
