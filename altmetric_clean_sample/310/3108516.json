This one-pot protocol utilizes an oligopeptide multicatalyst, m-CPBA as the oxidant, and N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide as the activating agent. Racemic acyclic diols as well as trans-cycloalkane-1,2-diols were kinetically resolved, achieving high selectivities and good yields for the products and recovered diols.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9f","authors":["Christine Hofmann"],"doi":"10.1021\/jo502670p","first_seen_on":"2015-01-27T15:05:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-3263"],"journal":"Journal of Organic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1422371111,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jo502670p?ref=tw&hootPostID=3f83ee8ac0862cf2a91a2104494b2509&"],"pmid":"25569106","pubdate":"2015-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Alcohol Cross-Coupling for the Kinetic Resolution of Diols via Oxidative Esterification.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alcohol-crosscoupling-kinetic-resolution-diols-via-oxidative-esterification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4752685,"mean":5.7097382931457,"rank":3366608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":774948,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4752685,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166853,"mean":8.5759550859447,"rank":115747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":32905,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166853,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3526,"mean":2.8213736170213,"rank":2475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3526,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201,"mean":1.12259,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
