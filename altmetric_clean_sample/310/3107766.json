Kindlins are integrin cytoplasmic tail (CT) binding partners, are essential for optimal integrin activation, and kindlin-3 fulfills this role in hematopoietic cells. Here, we used human platelets and human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells, which express integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23, to investigate whether phosphorylation of kindlin-3 regulate integrin activation. When HEL cells were stimulated with thrombopoietin (TPO) or phorbol 12-mirystate 13-acetate (PMA), \u03b1IIb\u03b23 became activated as evidenced by binding of an activation-specific monoclonal antibody and soluble fibrinogen, adherence and spreading on fibrinogen, colocalization of \u03b23 integrin and kindlin-3 in focal adhesions, and enhanced \u03b23 integrin-kindlin-3 association in immunoprecipitates. Kindlin-3 knockdown impaired adhesion and spreading on fibrinogen. Stimulation of HEL cells with agonists significantly increased kindlin-3 phosphorylation as detected by mass spectrometric sequencing. T482 or S484 was identified as a phosphorylation site, which resides in a sequence not conserved in kindlin-1 or kindlin-2. These same residues were phosphorylated in kindlin-3 when platelets were stimulated with thrombin. When expressed in HEL cells, T482S484\/AA kindlin-3 decreased soluble ligand binding and cell spreading on fibrinogen compared to wild-type kindlin-3. A membrane-permeable peptide containing residues 476-485 of kindlin-3 was introduced into HEL cells and platelets, adhesion and spreading of both cell types was blunted compared to a scrambled control peptide. These data identify a role kindlin-3 phosphorylation in integrin \u03b23 activation and provide a basis for functional differences between kindlin-3 and other two kindlin paralogs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Bialkowska K","Byzova TV","Plow EF"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m114.634436","first_seen_on":"2015-01-27T12:19:59+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1422364733,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25609252?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25609252","pubdate":"2015-01-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Site specific phosphorylation of kindlin-3 regulates its capacity to control cellular responses mediated by integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sitespecific-phosphorylation-kindlin3-protein-regulates-capacity-control-cellular-responses-mediated"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":3345388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1484481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178712,"mean":8.5331251238033,"rank":114396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":56107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178712,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27747,"mean":2.9655440784257,"rank":23570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":3725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27747,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":359,"mean":3.2183966480447,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":359,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
