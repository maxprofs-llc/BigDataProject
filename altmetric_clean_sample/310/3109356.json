Numerous studies have shown that exposures to Ln cause pulmonary injury in animals, but very little is known about the molecular mechanisms of the pulmonary inflammation caused by cerium chloride (CeCl3) exposure. In this study, we evaluated the oxidative stress and molecular mechanism underlying with the pulmonary inflammation associated with chronic lung toxicity in mice treated with nasally instilled CeCl3 for 90 consecutive days. Our findings suggest that significant cerium accumulated in the lung, leading the obvious increase of the lung indices, significant increases in inflammatory cells and levels of lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphate, and total protein, overproduction of reactive oxygen species and peroxidation of lipids, reduced antioxidant capacity, and pulmonary inflammation. CeCl3 exposure also activated nuclear factor \u03baB, increased the expression of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, cyclooxygenase-2, heme oxygenase 1, interleukin 2, interleukin 4, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, interleukin 18, interleukin 1\u03b2, and CYP1A1. However, CeCl3 reduced the expression of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB)-inhibiting factor and heat shock protein 70. These findings suggest that the pulmonary inflammation caused by CeCl3 in mice is closely associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine expression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c68","authors":["Hong J","Yu X","Pan X","Zhao X","Sheng L","Sang X","Lin A","Zhang C","Zhao Y","Gui S","Sun Q","Wang L","Hong F"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12011-014-9953-3","first_seen_on":"2015-01-27T19:38:56+00:00","issns":["1559-0720"],"issue":"","journal":"Biological Trace Element Research","last_mentioned_on":1422387514,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24736977?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s12011-014-9953-3"],"pmid":"24736977","pubdate":"2014-04-17T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nutrition","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Pulmonary Toxicity in Mice Following Exposure to Cerium Chloride","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pulmonary-toxicity-mice-following-exposure-cerium-chloride"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4669204,"mean":5.6775783798666,"rank":2319857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2210748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4669204,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160855,"mean":8.7477561142404,"rank":76039,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":77321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160855,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":520,"mean":2.2817764932563,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":520,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.065,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
