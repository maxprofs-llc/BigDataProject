Aims To examine the consistency of reporting of mTBI over time and identify factors associated with inconsistent reporting. Method A longitudinal cohort of 948 US National Guard Soldiers deployed to Iraq completed self-report questionnaire screening for mTBI and psychological symptoms while in-theatre 1 month before returning home (time 1, T1) and 1 year later (time 2, T2). Results Most respondents (n = 811, 85.5%) were consistent in their reporting of mTBI across time. Among those who were inconsistent in their reports (n = 137, 14.5%), the majority denied mTBI at T1 and affirmed mTBI at T2 (n = 123, 89.8%). Respondents rarely endorsed mTBI in-theatre and later denied mTBI (n = 14, 10.2% of those with inconsistent reports). Post-deployment post-traumatic stress symptoms and non-specific physical complaints were significantly associated with inconsistent report of mTBI. Conclusions Military service members' self-reports of mTBI are generally consistent over time; however, inconsistency in retrospective self-reporting of mTBI status is associated with current post-traumatic stress symptoms and non-specific physical health complaints.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057a0","authors":["Nathaniel W Nelson","Carolyn R Anderson","Paul Thuras","Shannon M Kehle-Forbes","Paul A Arbisi","Christopher R Erbes","Melissa A Polusny","Nelson NW","Anderson CR","Thuras P","Kehle-Forbes SM","Arbisi PA","Erbes CR","Polusny MA","Nathaniel W.
