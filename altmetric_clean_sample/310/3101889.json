A total of 361 interventions were collected with a physician acceptance rate of 95.8 percent. Eighty-two of the 361 interventions were reviewed by seven physicians with 93 percent of those being judged to have had a positive effect on patient outcome, 7 percent were judged to have had no effect, while none reviewed were judged to be detrimental. Life-saving interventions were judged to have occurred in 8.5 percent of interventions, while 90 percent of the interventions were perceived to have resulted in improved quality of care and\/or physician education. Cost analysis was performed comparing the difference of total medication costs (drug, pharmacy, nursing and drug assay costs) for a 24 hour period prior to and after the intervention occurred. The cost-avoidance over the two week period was calculated to be $679, representing a conservative estimate of an annual cost-avoidance of $17,654. Costs not evaluated were those avoided due to increased quality of care, decreased adverse drug effects and decreased length of hospital stay. Pharmacists' interventions which represent only a portion of a pharmacist's responsibilities, improve the quality of patient care and result in cost avoidance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006db4","authors":["D K Strong","G W Tsang"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-25T11:45:47+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0008-4123"],"issue":"3","journal":"Canadian Journal of Hospital Pharmacy","last_mentioned_on":1422198303,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10126864"],"pmid":"10126864","pubdate":"1993-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"title":"Focus and impact of pharmacists' interventions.","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/focus-impact-pharmacists-interventions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6550380,"mean":6.0700901193648,"rank":2909144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3465660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6550380,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206927,"mean":8.3975815508928,"rank":97031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":101101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206927,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":2.5166031746032,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
