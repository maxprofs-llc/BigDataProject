Justice-involved women have a higher prevalence of mental illness than men, and it plays a greater role in their criminal behavior. Despite this, studies examining whether women respond differently than men to mental health courts are lacking. Study goals were to examine gender-related differences in mental health court participation, and in criminal justice, psychiatric and health-related outcomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"518095833cf058746e000030","authors":["Catherine L Kothari","Robert Butkiewicz","Emily R Williams","Caron Jacobson","Diane S Morse","Catherine Cerulli"],"doi":"10.1186\/s40352-014-0012-0","first_seen_on":"2015-01-27T13:32:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[""],"issue":"1","journal":"Health & Justice","last_mentioned_on":1422365457,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4269165\/"],"pmid":"25530934","pubdate":"2014-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"NIH Public Access","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Community and Environmental Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Criminology & Criminal Justice","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Policy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"}],"startpage":"12","title":"Does gender matter?
