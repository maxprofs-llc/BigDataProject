Methods In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group, 12-week, Phase 2 study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00687193), 317 patients received tofacitinib 1, 3, 5, 10, or 15 mg as monotherapy or placebo twice daily (BID). Primary endpoint: response rate by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) \u226520% improvement criteria (ACR20) at Week 12. Results ACR20 response rates: 37.7% (20\/53), 67.9% (36\/53), 73.1% (38\/52), 84.9% (45\/53), and 90.7% (49\/54) with tofacitinib 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 mg BID respectively, vs 15.4% (8\/52) with placebo (p<0.01; all doses). Dose-dependent ACR20 responses with tofacitinib vs placebo occurred from Week 2 onwards (p<0.05). Changes from baseline in DAS28-4(ESR) (28-joint disease activity score using erythrocyte sedimentation rate) improved with tofacitinib vs placebo from Week 4 (p<0.01; all doses). Six tofacitinib patients experienced treatment-related serious adverse events (AEs). Most common treatment-emergent AEs: nasopharyngitis (10% vs 12%), hyperlipidemia (5% vs 0%). Serum creatinine, hemoglobin, and total-, low-, and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were increased with tofacitinib. Conclusions Tofacitinib produced dose-dependent ACR20 responses and reduced disease activity. The safety profile was consistent with that reported from global monotherapy trials.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310a","authors":["Yoshiya Tanaka"],"doi":"10.3109\/14397595.2014.995875","first_seen_on":"2015-01-27T17:37:45+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Modern Rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1422380234,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/14397595.2014.995875"],"pmid":"25496464","pubdate":"2014-12-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Efficacy and Safety of Tofacitinib as Monotherapy in Japanese Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis: A 12-Week, Randomized, Phase 2 Study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-safety-tofacitinib-monotherapy-japanese-patients-active-rheumatoid-arthritis-12week-randomi-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4663699,"mean":5.6667241879742,"rank":3905323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4663699,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160677,"mean":8.695822836018,"rank":128846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160677,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":1.1098905472637,"rank":148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":0.6425,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
