Many hospitals use this office to collect death paperwork, release bodies to funeral homes, perform autopsies, or increase rates of autopsies and organ and tissue donations. It is not common for an ODA to report to the Department of Social Work rather than the Department of Pathology. Few offices put the emphasis on postmortem care for families or staff members. A comprehensive postmortem program needs many different components, including support to families (for example, viewing the dead, advising on next steps after a death, and providing bereavement support), consulting with and supporting multidisciplinary staffers, and coordinating with multiple medical center departments. This article examines a hospital's use of social work principles and clinical training to provide leadership to an ODA and describes the key elements and advantages of a successful program.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029b9","authors":["Susan Sefansky","Sefansky, Susan"],"doi":"10.1093\/hsw\/hlw052","first_seen_on":"2016-12-20T14:41:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1545-6854","0360-7283"],"issue":"1","journal":"Health & Social Work","last_mentioned_on":1490783405,"links":["http:\/\/hsw.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/12\/03\/hsw.hlw052.long","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/hsw\/article\/42\/1\/e8\/2631411\/Involved-in-the-Business-of-Death-The-Social-Work?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=ouppolitics&utm_campaign=ouppolitics"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hsw.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/12\/03\/hsw.hlw052.full.pdf","pmid":"28395069","pubdate":"2016-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["socialsciences"],"title":"Involved in the Business of Death: The Social Work Role in Postmortem Care","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/hsw\/article-lookup\/doi\/10.1093\/hsw\/hlw052","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/involved-business-death-social-work-role-postmortem-care"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.45,"score_history":{"1y":2.45,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":3506845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4915464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280264,"mean":12.077046181622,"rank":109080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":170683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280264,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":214,"mean":4.7221408450704,"rank":140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":214,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":7.3409090909091,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
