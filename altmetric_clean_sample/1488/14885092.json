Resolution at telomeres requires the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase tankyrase 1, but the mechanism that times its action is unknown. Here, we show that tankyrase 1 activity at telomeres is controlled by a ubiquitination\/deubiquitination cycle depending on opposing ubiquitin ligase and deubiquitinase activities. In late S\/G2 phase, the DNA damage-responsive E3 ligase RNF8 conjugates K63-linked ubiquitin chains to tankyrase 1, while in G1 phase such ubiquitin chains are removed by BRISC, an ABRO1\/BRCC36-containing deubiquitinase complex. We show that K63-linked ubiquitin chains accumulate on tankyrase 1 in late S\/G2 to promote its stabilization, association with telomeres, and resolution of cohesion. Timing of this posttranslational modification coincides with the ATM-mediated DNA damage response that occurs on functional telomeres following replication in G2. Removal of ubiquitin chains is controlled by ABRO1\/BRCC36 and occurs as cells exit mitosis and enter G1, ensuring that telomere cohesion is not resolved prematurely in S phase. Our studies suggest that a cell cycle-regulated posttranslational mechanism couples resolution of telomere cohesion with completion of telomere replication to ensure genome integrity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Ekta Tripathi","Susan Smith"],"doi":"10.15252\/embj.201695135","first_seen_on":"2016-12-20T14:50:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1460-2075"],"journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1482317699,"links":["http:\/\/emboj.embopress.org\/content\/early\/2016\/12\/19\/embj.201695135"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/emboj.embopress.org\/content\/embojnl\/early\/2016\/12\/19\/embj.201695135.full.pdf","pmid":"27993934","pubdate":"2016-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"EMBO Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"e201695135","subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Cell cycle\u2010regulated ubiquitination of tankyrase 1 by RNF8 and ABRO1\/BRCC36 controls the timing of sister telomere resolution","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cell-cycleregulated-ubiquitination-tankyrase-1-rnf8-abro1brcc36-controls-timing-sister-telomere-reso"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7917108,"mean":6.6979661075636,"rank":4152459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2208251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7917108,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251155,"mean":12.393296391855,"rank":139935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":87446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251155,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4419,"mean":5.1951661385242,"rank":3114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4419,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":15.466379310345,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
