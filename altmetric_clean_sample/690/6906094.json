Patients were classified into two groups: TK < 15\u00b0 group defined by preoperative TK below the mean degree of TK for the entire cohort (< 15\u00b0) and the TK \u2265 15\u00b0 group, defined by preoperative TK above the mean degree of kyphosis (\u2265 15\u00b0). Independent sample t tests were used to compare demographic data as well as radiographic outcomes between the two groups. There were no study-specific biases related to conflicts of interest.\nThe average preoperative TK was 14.0\u00b0, which improved significantly to 23.1\u00b0 (P < 0.0001) at the two-year final follow-up. Greater change in TK was predicted by a low preoperative TK (P < 0.0001). The TK <15\u00b0 group showed significant correlation between change in TK and number of facetectomy level (r = 0.492, P = 0.002). Similarly, significant correlation was found between change in TK and screw density (r = 0.333, P = 0.047). Conversely, in the TK \u226515\u00b0 group, correlation was found neither between change in TK and number of facetectomy level (r = 0.047, P = 0.812), nor with screw density (r = 0.030, P = 0.880). Furthermore, in patients with preoperative TK < 15\u00b0, change in TK was significantly correlated with screw density at the concave side (r = 0.351, P = 0.036), but not at the convex side (r = 0.144, P = 0.402).\nIn patients with hypokyphotic thoracic spine, significant positive correlation was found between change in TK and multilevel facetectomy or screw density at the concave side. This indicates that in patients with AIS who have thoracic hypokyphosis as part of their deformity, these factors must be factored into preoperative planning to correct hypokyphosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a8","authors":["Hideki Sudo","Yuichiro Abe","Terufumi Kokabu","Manabu Ito","Kuniyoshi Abumi","Yoichi Ito","Norimasa Iwasaki"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.spinee.2016.04.014","first_seen_on":"2016-04-22T22:46:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-1632"],"journal":"Spine Journal","last_mentioned_on":1461371848,"links":["http:\/\/www.thespinejournalonline.com\/article\/S1529-9430(16)30042-0\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.thespinejournalonline.com\/article\/S1529-9430(16)30042-0\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.thespinejournalonline.com\/article\/S1529943016300420\/pdf","pmid":"27114351","pubdate":"2016-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Correlation analysis between change in thoracic kyphosis and multilevel facetectomy\/ screw density in main thoracic adolescent idiopathic scoliosis surgery","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/correlation-analysis-between-change-thoracic-kyphosis-multilevel-facetectomy-screw-density-main-thor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7591700,"mean":6.5431604635494,"rank":3473927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3946622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7591700,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266893,"mean":11.331950459362,"rank":121692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":136460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266893,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2036,"mean":4.0295331695332,"rank":728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":1228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2036,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":5.0983146067416,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LaserSpineSurge\/statuses\/723644067289153537","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6906094],"posted_on":"2016-04-22T22:46:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Laser Spine Surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3560826595\/1b08c9f5f0d7207a5a4c9df20ccddeb1_normal.png","description":"We specialize in Laser Spine Surgery","id_on_source":"LaserSpineSurge","tweeter_id":"1372738182","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":363},"tweet_id":"723644067289153537"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/datadrivenspine\/statuses\/723650109397856256","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6906094],"posted_on":"2016-04-22T23:10:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Data Driven Spine","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/476524652026535936\/3DFDRbic_normal.jpeg","description":"Promulgating data driven spine care.","id_on_source":"datadrivenspine","tweeter_id":"2560150471","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":33},"tweet_id":"723650109397856256"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SpineCtrFlorida\/statuses\/723672098275774464","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6906094],"posted_on":"2016-04-23T00:37:28+00:00","author":{"name":"FloridaSpineCtr","url":"http:\/\/DavidCampbellMDPA.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000821604782\/603ddb596af82d0eb1cc079736c30d96_normal.png","description":"South Florida's leading fellowship trained Orthopaedic spine surgeon","id_on_source":"SpineCtrFlorida","tweeter_id":"534385588","geo":{"lt":26.93422,"ln":-80.09421,"country":"US"},"followers":83},"tweet_id":"723672098275774464"}]}}
