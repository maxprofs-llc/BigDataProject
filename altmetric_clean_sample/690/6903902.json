Here, we showed that conditional deletion of Mecp2 in cholinergic neurons caused part of RTT-like phenotypes, which could be rescued by re-expressing Mecp2 in the basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic neurons rather than in the caudate putamen of conditional knockout (Chat-Mecp2(-\/y)) mice. We found that choline acetyltransferase expression was decreased in the BF and that \u03b17 nicotine acetylcholine receptor signaling was strongly impaired in the hippocampus of Chat-Mecp2(-\/y) mice, which is sufficient to produce neuronal hyperexcitation and increase seizure susceptibility. Application of PNU282987 or nicotine in the hippocampus rescued these phenotypes in Chat-Mecp2(-\/y) mice. Taken together, our findings suggest that MeCP2 is critical for normal function of cholinergic neurons and dysfunction of cholinergic neurons can contribute to numerous neuropsychiatric phenotypes.Cell Research advance online publication 22 April 2016; doi: 10.1038\/cr.2016.48.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e1e","authors":["Ying Zhang","Shu-Xia Cao","Peng Sun","Hai-Yang He","Ci-Hang Yang","Xiao-Juan Chen","Chen-Jie Shen","Xiao-Dong Wang","Zhong Chen","Darwin K Berg","Shumin Duan","Xiao-Ming Li"],"doi":"10.1038\/cr.2016.48","first_seen_on":"2016-04-22T19:03:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1001-0602","1748-7838"],"journal":"Cell Research","last_mentioned_on":1461351766,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/cr\/rss\/aop\/~3\/i_Sh012h8Xs\/cr.2016.48"],"pmid":"27103432","pubdate":"2016-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Loss of MeCP2 in cholinergic neurons causes part of RTT-like phenotypes via \u03b17 receptor in hippocampus","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/loss-mecp2-cholinergic-neurons-causes-part-rttlike-phenotypes-via-%CE%B17-receptor-hippocampus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7588328,"mean":6.5418890751503,"rank":1039951,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6481140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7588328,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266862,"mean":11.331099808514,"rank":53708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":209435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266862,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":787,"mean":8.3339974554707,"rank":240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":787,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":10.52325,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
