Recently, through signaling pathway screening we found that CXXC5 activated Tgf\u03b2 and myocardial differentiation signaling pathways simultaneously. Although the physiological and pathological function of CXXC5 in many organs has been well elucidated, its function in heart remains unclear.\nHere, we found that zebrafish CXXC5 and SMAD were interacting through ZF-CXXC and MH1 domain. Over-expression of CXXC5 in cardiomyocyte increased the luciferase report activity of Tgf\u03b2 signaling pathway. Spatiotemporal expression profile of cxxc5 showed that it consistently expressed during cardiogenesis. Knockdown of cxxc5 in zebrafish displayed looping defects, cardiac dysplasia, pericardial edema, and decreased contraction ability, accompanied with down-regulation of members referring to cardiac looping downstream genes of Tgf\u03b2 signaling pathway, such as nkx2.5, hand2, and has2. Co-injection of hand2 mRNA with cxxc5 morpholino rescued the cardiac looping detects.\nOur study is the first to provide an in vivo evidence for cxxc5 regulating heart development and cardiac looping via Tgf\u03b2 related signaling pathway. This finding suggested that CXXC5 may serve as a possible marker that has potential diagnostic and prognostic value in fetus with congenital heart disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b29","authors":["Xiyang Peng","Guanming Li","Yuequn Wang","Jian Zhuang","Rong Luo","Jimei Chen","Fa Chen","Yan Shi","Jiani Li","Zuoqiong Zhou","Xiaoyang Mo","Xianchu Liu","Wuzhou Yuan","Qun Zeng","Yongqing Li","Zhigang Jiang","Yongqi Wan","Xiangli Ye","Wei Xu","Xijun Wang","Xiongwei Fan","Ping Zhu","Xiushan Wu","Yun Deng"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijcard.2016.03.201","endpage":"253","first_seen_on":"2016-04-22T21:19:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1874-1754"],"journal":"International Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1461359957,"links":["http:\/\/www.internationaljournalofcardiology.com\/article\/S0167-5273%2816%2930668-4\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.internationaljournalofcardiology.com\/article\/S0167527316306684\/pdf","pmid":"27077543","pubdate":"2016-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"246","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"CXXC5 is required for cardiac looping relating to TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway in zebrafish","type":"article","volume":"214","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cxxc5-required-cardiac-looping-relating-tgf%CE%B2-signaling-pathway-zebrafish"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7588328,"mean":6.5418890751503,"rank":5742086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1018557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7588328,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266862,"mean":11.331101682149,"rank":186833,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266862,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3400,"mean":2.9876310679612,"rank":1782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":995,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3400,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":2.5245833333333,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
