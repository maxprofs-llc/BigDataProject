At near, 23 children were exophoric (exo, <0 \u0394), and 25 were esophoric (eso, \u22650 \u0394). The AMFs and phoria through multiple addition lenses (-1.00, 0, +1.00, +2.00, and +3.00D on each eye) and prisms (base-in prism power: 3 \u0394, 2 \u0394, 1 \u0394; and base-out prism power: 1 \u0394 and 2 \u0394 on each eye) were measured at 25cm under binocular viewing conditions with a Grand Seiko WAM-5500 auto-refractor and a modified Thorington card.\nHigher AMFs were found in EOM than in EMM (EOM, 0.19\u00b10.06D; EMM, 0.16\u00b10.03D; p=0.035). Plus additions from +1.00 to +3.00D reduced the AMFs in both EMM and EOM, except +3.00D for EMM. In both refractive groups, -1.00D additions increased AMFs. Esophores showed greater AMFs compared with exophores (esophores, 0.20\u00b10.01D; exophores, 0.16\u00b10.01D; p=0.012). Prisms increased the AMFs in EMM and did not alter the AMFs in EOM.\nMicrofluctuations of accommodation decreased with plus addition lenses and increased with negative addition lenses. Plus addition lenses of +2.00 to +3.00D for EOM and +2.00D for EMM decreased AMFs the least at a 25-cm working distance. Esophores had higher AMFs than exophores, indicating that phoria status influences AMFs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083e1","authors":["Lin, Huiling","Drobe, Bj\u00f6rn","Jin, Wanqing","Lin, Meng","Chen, Yunyun","Chen, Hao"],"doi":"10.1097\/opx.0000000000000816","endpage":"496","first_seen_on":"2016-04-22T23:48:03+00:00","issns":["1538-9235","1040-5488"],"issue":"5","journal":"Optometry and Vision Science","last_mentioned_on":1461368848,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/optvissci\/Abstract\/2016\/05000\/Effects_of_Near_Addition_Lenses_and_Prisms_on.7.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/optvissci\/2016\/05000\/Effects_of_Near_Addition_Lenses_and_Prisms_on.7.pdf","pmid":"26808382","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"488","subjects":["optometry"],"title":"Effects of Near Addition Lenses and Prisms on Accommodative Microfluctuations in Chinese Children","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/optvissci\/Fulltext\/2016\/05000\/Effects_of_Near_Addition_Lenses_and_Prisms_on.7.aspx","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-near-addition-lenses-prisms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7588328,"mean":6.5418890751503,"rank":5742086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1018562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7588328,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266862,"mean":11.331072078722,"rank":186832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43096,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266862,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1234,"mean":5.2552814274128,"rank":897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1234,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":12.46103030303,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HargraveEye\/statuses\/723659515124695041","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6906584],"posted_on":"2016-04-22T23:47:28+00:00","author":{"name":"Hargrave Eye Center","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/hargraveeyecenter","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/458688906616004608\/2t7LIZGj_normal.jpeg","description":"The Hargrave Eye Center is a well respected, full-service ophthalmic center at the Methodist Dallas Medical Center operated by Dr. Sylvia Hargrave.","id_on_source":"HargraveEye","tweeter_id":"2458541456","geo":{"lt":32.78306,"ln":-96.80667,"country":"US"},"followers":1302},"tweet_id":"723659515124695041"}]}}
