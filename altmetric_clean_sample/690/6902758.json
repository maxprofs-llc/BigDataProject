Data on food label use, diet quality, covariates, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were collected at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months. Data were analyzed via mixed effects and multilevel structural equation modeling.\nFood label use in the intervention (vs control) group was significantly higher at 3, 12, and 18 months (odds ratio\u2009=\u20092.99; 95% confidence interval\u2009=\u20091.69, 5.29). Food label use and diet quality were positive mediators of improved HbA1c levels.\nCulturally tailored interventions led by CHWs could increase food label use. Also, CHW-delivered food label education may lead to better diet quality and improve glycemic control among Latinos with type 2 diabetes. (Am J Public Health.
