Due to the failure of meropenem (120 mg\/kg\/d in divided doses every 8 hours and infused over 30 minutes) in the initial infection, the dose was infused over 4 hours during the recurrence. Meropenem is an antibiotic for which efficacy is time dependent, and 4-hour versus 30-minute infusions have been shown to prolong the time the concentration of the antibiotic exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the organism at the site of infection (T>MIC). Meropenem serum concentrations were obtained and indicated that T>MIC was at least 75% of the dosing interval. Our patient improved with no noted recurrences or adverse effects on the extended-infusion meropenem regimen. Utilization of extended-infusion beta-lactam dosing whenever possible in the treatment of serious infections caused by gram-negative organisms should be considered, as this dosing appears to be safe and improves the probability of achieving pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic goals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002eba","authors":["Nichols, Kristen R","Knoderer, Chad A","Jackson, Nicholas G","Manaloor, John J","Christenson, John C"],"doi":"10.1177\/0897190015585757","endpage":"433","first_seen_on":"2016-05-13T10:29:07+00:00","issns":["1531-1937","0897-1900"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Pharmacy Practice","last_mentioned_on":1463116390,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26033796?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26033796","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"430","subjects":["pharmacy"],"title":"Success With Extended-Infusion Meropenem After Recurrence of Baclofen Pump-Related Achromobacter Xylosoxidans Meningitis in an Adolescent","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/success-extendedinfusion-meropenem-after-recurrence-baclofen-pumprelated-achromobacter-xylosoxidans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7693476,"mean":6.6032853252866,"rank":6655786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7693476,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269122,"mean":11.424051181438,"rank":224804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269122,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":396,"mean":2.5829721518987,"rank":357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":396,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.1461538461538,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ndm1bacteria\/statuses\/730989239014281217","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7372575],"posted_on":"2016-05-13T05:13:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Dave Roberts","url":"http:\/\/www.ndm1bacteria.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1294321879\/713px-EscherichiaColi_NIAID_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"ndm1bacteria","tweeter_id":"177368473","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":545},"tweet_id":"730989239014281217"}]}}
