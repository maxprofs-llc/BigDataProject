While this work presents genetic evidence for a piRNA-mediated p53 interaction with transposons in Drosophila and zebrafish, it is herein placed in the context of a decade or so of additional work that demonstrated a role for p53 in regulating transposons and other repetitive elements. The line of thought in those studies began with the observation that transposons damage DNA and p53 regulates DNA damage. The presence of transposon movement can increase the rate of evolution in the germ line and alter genes involved in signal transduction pathways. Transposition can also play an important role in cancers where the p53 gene function is often mutated. This is particularly interesting as recent work has shown that de-repression of repetitive elements in cancer has important consequences for the immune system and tumor microenvironment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023cb","authors":["Levine, Arnold J.","Ting, David T.","Greenbaum, Benjamin D.","Levine, Arnold J","Ting, David T","Greenbaum, Benjamin D"],"doi":"10.1002\/bies.201600031","endpage":"513","first_seen_on":"2016-05-13T12:13:43+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-1878"],"issue":"6","journal":"BioEssays","last_mentioned_on":1463233086,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/bies.201600031&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27172878?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27172878?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bies.201600031\/pdf","pmid":"27172878","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"508","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","biology"],"title":"P53 and the defenses against genome instability caused by transposons and repetitive elements","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/p53-defenses-against-genome-instability-caused-transposons-repetitive-elements"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7695064,"mean":6.6060460035168,"rank":3762695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3736633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7695064,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269147,"mean":11.424103185631,"rank":134358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":124189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269147,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1370,"mean":5.9747888970051,"rank":921,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1370,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":5.9418918918919,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
