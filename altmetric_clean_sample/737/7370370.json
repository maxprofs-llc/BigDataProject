Community-based programs, such as beauty salons, have been used to reach diverse ethnic\/racial women, yet little is known about diverse ethnic\/racial women cosmetologists' involvement in health promotion and their health behaviors, which is the purpose of this review. The growing beauty salon health promotion literature indicates that their roles in these studies have been varied, not only as health promoters but also as recruiters, facilitators, and in general major catalysts for investigator-initiated studies. However, the review also identified a major void in the literature in that there were few studies on health behaviors of diverse ethnic\/racial women cosmetologists, especially African American women cosmetologists. Recommendations include increasing the capacity of diverse ethnic\/racial women cosmetologists as community health leaders and investigating their health status, knowledge, attitudes, and practices.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67a3cf058f610009782","authors":["Naomi Thelusma","Penny Ralston"],"doi":"10.4137\/cmwh.s34688","first_seen_on":"2016-05-13T08:50:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1179-562X"],"issue":"Suppl 1","journal":"Clinical Medicine Insights: Women's Health","last_mentioned_on":1463098180,"links":["http:\/\/www.la-press.com\/health-promotion-and-health-behaviors-of-diverse-ethnicracial-women-co-article-a5616?source=rss&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.la-press.com\/health-promotion-and-health-behaviors-of-diverse-ethnicracial-women-co-article-a5616"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.la-press.com\/redirect_file.php?fileId=7486&filename=5616-CMWH-Health-Promotion-and-Health-Behaviors-of-Diverse-Ethnic-Racial-Women-C.pdf&fileType=pdf","pmcid":"PMC4869603","pmid":"27199580","pubdate":"2016-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"9","title":"Health Promotion and Health Behaviors of Diverse Ethnic\/Racial Women Cosmetologists: A Review","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/health-promotion-health-behaviors-diverse-ethnicracial-women-cosmetologists-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7693476,"mean":6.6032853252866,"rank":3984724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2162246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7693476,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269121,"mean":11.424128931331,"rank":146152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269121,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":2.2095238095238,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.39,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
