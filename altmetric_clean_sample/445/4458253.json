This allows for tuning the relative amplitude and sign of the tunneling for different internal states. We observe substantially different momentum distributions depending on the spin state of fermionic ^{40}K atoms. Using dipole oscillations, we probe the spin-dependent band structure and find good agreement with theory. In\u00a0situ expansion dynamics demonstrate that one state can be completely localized while others remain itinerant. A systematic study shows negligible heating and lifetimes of several seconds in the Hubbard regime.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Jotzu, Gregor","Messer, Michael","G\u00f6rg, Frederik","Greif, Daniel","Desbuquois, R\u00e9mi","Esslinger, Tilman"],"first_seen_on":"2015-09-01T10:03:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1079-7114"],"issue":"7","journal":"Physical Review Letters","last_mentioned_on":1441101813,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26317717?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26317717","pubdate":"2015-09-01T22:02:05+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Creating State-Dependent Lattices for Ultracold Fermions by Magnetic Gradient Modulation.","type":"article","volume":"115"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5579069,"mean":6.3901089293072,"rank":2952495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1885093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5579069,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194361,"mean":9.5158847808192,"rank":105234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":69896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194361,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14048,"mean":9.9181469352887,"rank":8823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":4332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14048,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172,"mean":28.354070175439,"rank":112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SpinStatePapers\/statuses\/638653411425062912","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4458253],"posted_on":"2015-09-01T10:03:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Spin-state Papers","url":"http:\/\/www.marcelswart.eu","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/552429679714390016\/zJTb3ZEr_normal.jpeg","description":"Here you will find an automated update of papers dealing with spin-states in transition-metal complexes, taken directly from PubMed","id_on_source":"SpinStatePapers","tweeter_id":"2963866557","geo":{"lt":41.98311,"ln":2.82493,"country":"ES"},"followers":52},"tweet_id":"638653411425062912"}]}}
