Although control programs based on these principles have reduced prevalence of MAP infection in dairy herds, they have generally not eliminated the infection. Recent infection trial(s) have yielded new knowledge regarding diagnostic testing and age- and dose-dependent susceptibility to MAP infection. Calves up to 1 year of age are still susceptible to MAP infection; therefore, control programs should refrain from referring to specific ages with respect to susceptibility and prevention of new infections. Notwithstanding, lesions were more severe when calves were inoculated at 2 weeks versus 1 year of age. Furthermore, a high inoculation dose resulted in more pronounced lesions than a low inoculation dose, especially in young calves. Consequently, keeping infection pressure low should decrease the incidence of new MAP infections and severity of JD in cattle that do acquire the infection. It was also evident that early diagnosis of MAP infection was possible and could improve efficacy of control programs. Although its use will still need to be validated in the field, a combination of antibody ELISA and fecal culture in young stock, in addition to testing cattle >36 months of age when screening a herd for paratuberculosis, was expected to improve detection of dairy cattle infected with MAP. Although calves were inoculated using a standardized method in a controlled environment, there were substantial differences among calves with regards to immune response, shedding and pathology. Therefore, we inferred there were genetic differences in susceptibility. Important insights were derived from experimental infection trials. Therefore, it was expected that these could improve paratuberculosis control programs by reducing severity and incidence of JD by lowering infection pressure on-farm, and reducing exposure of young calves and older cattle. Furthermore, an earlier diagnosis could be achieved by combining ELISA and fecal shedding in young stock, in addition to testing cattle >36 months of age.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003384","authors":["Mortier, Rienske A R","Barkema, Herman W","De Buck, Jeroen"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.prevetmed.2015.08.011","first_seen_on":"2015-09-01T10:11:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-1716","01675877"],"journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1445296786,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26321657?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0167587715002755"],"pmid":"26321657","pubdate":"2015-09-01T22:00:32+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Susceptibility to and diagnosis of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis infection in dairy calves: A review ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/susceptibility-diagnosis-mycobacterium-avium-subspecies-paratuberculosis-infection-dairy-calves-revi-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6335899,"mean":5.977107861901,"rank":1350513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":4978410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6335899,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186382,"mean":9.7953451693038,"rank":53281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":132699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186382,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":573,"mean":2.7381643356643,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":489,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":573,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":3.5747619047619,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
