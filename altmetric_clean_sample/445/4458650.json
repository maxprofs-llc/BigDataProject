However, it is unclear how differently the biomarker predicts adverse outcomes in HF with preserved EF (HFpEF) versus HF with reduced EF (HFrEF).\nFrom the Korean Heart Failure registry, a prospective multicentre cohort for consecutive patients who were hospitalised for acute HF syndrome, those with available NT-proBNP and LVEF measurements were extracted. Patients with LVEF \u226550% were categorised as the HFpEF group (N=528) and those with \u226440% as the HFrEF group (N=1142).\nPatients with HFpEF had significantly lower NT-proBNP level than those with HFrEF (median 2723 vs 5644\u2005ng\/L, p<0.001). Event-free survival did not differ between the two groups either in terms of death from any cause (88.4% vs 86.9%; p=0.471) or the composite of death or HF readmission at 1\u2005year (73.8% vs 70.6%; p=0.225). High levels of NT-proBNP were significantly associated with poor outcomes. However, the relationship was not different among the HFpEF and HFrEF groups (interaction p=0.956 for all-cause death; p=0.351 for the composite of all-cause death or HF hospitalisation).\nPlasma level of NT-proBNP is the most powerful prognostic factor in both HFpEF and HFrEF. Although patients with HFpEF have lower NT-proBNP levels, the prognosis of a patient with HFpEF expected from a given NT-proBNP level is similar with his\/her counterpart with HFrEF.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029cd","authors":["Kang, Si-Hyuck","Park, Jin Joo","Choi, Dong-Ju","Yoon, Chang-Hwan","Oh, Il-Young","Kang, Seok-Min","Yoo, Byung-Su","Jeon, Eun-Seok","Kim, Jae-Joong","Cho, Myeong-Chan","Chae, Shung Chull","Ryu, Kyu-Hyung","Oh, Byung-Hee",", "],"doi":"10.1136\/heartjnl-2015-307782","first_seen_on":"2015-09-01T10:29:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1468-201X"],"issue":"23","journal":"Heart","last_mentioned_on":1447794388,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26319121?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26319121\/","http:\/\/heart.bmj.com\/content\/101\/23\/1881.short?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/heart.bmj.com\/content\/101\/23\/1881.short?rss=1&utm_content=buffer49fb3&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/heart.bmj.com\/content\/101\/23\/1881.short?rss=1&utm_content=buffer5b309&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"26319121","pubdate":"2015-09-01T22:01:31+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Prognostic value of NT-proBNP in heart failure with preserved versus reduced EF","type":"article","volume":"101","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prognostic-value-ntprobnp-heart-failure-preserved-versus-reduced-ef"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6577121,"mean":6.1012807651375,"rank":1258511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5310260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6577121,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199617,"mean":9.6169319994391,"rank":50973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":148234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199617,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2265,"mean":9.1503206713781,"rank":575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":1683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2265,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":5.7425393258427,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
