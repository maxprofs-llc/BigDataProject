Pathological changes, including infarction, tumourigenesis and inflammation, commonly result in decreases in the ECF pH in the affected tissues. In this study, we report that proliferation is promoted and apoptosis is inhibited by decreases in extracellular pH. Furthermore, we demonstrated that proton-sensing G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are required for the pH-dependent regulation of proliferation and apoptosis through the G protein \u03b1 subunit 12\/13 (G12\/13) and Rho GTPases. Next, we identified Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) as a downstream effector of Rho signalling. Together, the results from our study demonstrate that extracellular pH can modulate cell proliferation and apoptosis by regulating the proton-sensing GPCR-YAP pathway.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f610007827","authors":["Hongyi Zhu","Xiangguo Cheng","Xin Niu","Yuelei Zhang","Junjie Guan","Xiaolin Liu","Shicong Tao","Yang Wang","Changqing Zhang"],"doi":"10.7150\/ijbs.12500","endpage":"1189","first_seen_on":"2015-08-30T06:07:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1449-2288"],"issue":"10","journal":"International Journal of Biological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1430265600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.7150\/ijbs.12500"],"pmid":"26327812","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1181","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Proton-sensing GPCR-YAP Signalling Promotes Cell Proliferation and Survival","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protonsensing-gpcryap-signalling-promotes-cell-proliferation-survival"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5032982,"mean":5.9702113860563,"rank":2656583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1719342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5032982,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179125,"mean":9.5919990844333,"rank":96659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":64641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179125,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209,"mean":2.6297788461538,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.83928571428571,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
