Single-layer light-emitting diodes using the composite thin film sandwiched between indium tin oxide and indium-gallium eutectic alloy exhibit a low turn-on voltage and high brightness because of the ionic conductivity of the composite film and the formation of a p-i-n homojunction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006895","authors":["Li, Junqiang","Bade, Sri Ganesh R","Shan, Xin","Yu, Zhibin","Bade, Sri Ganesh R."],"doi":"10.1002\/adma.201502490","endpage":"5202","first_seen_on":"2015-08-31T14:44:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-4095"],"issue":"35","journal":"Advanced Materials","last_mentioned_on":1442328479,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201502490\/full","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201502490\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/wol1\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201502490\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201502490\/pdf","pmid":"26247326","pubdate":"2015-08-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"5196","subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Single\u2010Layer Light\u2010Emitting Diodes Using Organometal Halide Perovskite\/Poly(ethylene oxide) Composite Thin Films","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/singlelayer-lightemitting-diodes-using-organometal-halide-perovskitepolyethylene-oxide-composite-thi-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7123621,"mean":6.3013161370174,"rank":155577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":6968060,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7123621,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225560,"mean":8.8731010245657,"rank":8532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":217012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225560,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3955,"mean":10.317544258978,"rank":215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":3739,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3955,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129,"mean":15.227203125,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
