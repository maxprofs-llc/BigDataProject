To address this issue, mice that lack two members of the fos family, c-fos and fosB, were derived. The fosB-\/- c-fos-\/- mice are similar in phenotype to c-fos-\/- mice but are 30% smaller. This decrease in size is consistent with an abnormality in cell proliferation. Fibroblasts derived from fosB-\/- c-fos-\/- mice were found to have a defect in proliferation that results at least in part from a failure to induce cyclin D1 following serum-stimulated cell cycle reentry. Although definitive evidence that c-Fos and FosB directly induce cyclin D1 transcription will require further analysis, these findings raise the possibility that c-Fos and FosB are either direct or indirect transcriptional regulators of the cyclin D1 gene and may function as a critical link between serum stimulation and cell cycle progression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310d","authors":["Brown, J R","Nigh, E","Lee, R J","Ye, H","Thompson, M A","Saudou, F","Pestell, R G","Greenberg, M E"],"first_seen_on":"2015-08-30T10:21:09+00:00","issns":["0270-7306"],"issue":"9","journal":"Molecular & Cellular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1498057325,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9710644","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9710644"],"pmcid":"PMC109145","pmid":"9710644","pubdate":"1998-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Fos family members induce cell cycle entry by activating cyclin D1.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fos-family-members-induce-cell-cycle-entry-activating-cyclin-d1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":2157326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5098301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232741,"mean":9.1452775199794,"rank":68871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":159759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232741,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3952,"mean":2.9333996456593,"rank":415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3952,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":2.5116,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
