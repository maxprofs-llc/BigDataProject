To compare the rates of important patient outcomes (infection, cardiovascular events\u00a0and death) between facilities predominantly using ferumoxytol versus iron sucrose (IS) or ferric gluconate (FG) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)-initiating hemodialysis (HD).\nUsing the United States Renal Data System, we identified all HD facilities that switched (almost) all patients from IS\/FG to ferumoxytol (July 2009-December 2011). Each switching facility was matched with three facilities that continued IS\/FG use. All incident ESRD patients subsequently initiating HD in these centers were studied and assigned their facility exposure. They were followed for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular hospitalization\/death or infectious hospitalization\/death. Follow-up ended at kidney transplantation, switch to peritoneal dialysis, transfer to another facility, facility switch to another iron formulation and end of database (31 December 2011). Cox proportional hazards regression was then used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios [HR (95% confidence intervals)].\nIn July 2009-December 2011, 278 HD centers switched to ferumoxytol; 265 units (95.3%) were matched with 3 units each that continued to use IS\/FG. Subsequently, 14 206 patients initiated HD, 3752 (26.4%) in ferumoxytol and 10 454 (73.6%) in IS\/FG centers; their characteristics were very similar. During 6433 person-years, 1929 all-cause, 726 cardiovascular and 191 infectious deaths occurred. Patients in ferumoxytol (versus IS\/FG) facilities experienced similar all-cause [0.95 (0.85-1.07)], cardiovascular [0.99 (0.83-1.19)] and infectious mortality [0.88 (0.61-1.25)]. Among 5513 Medicare (Parts A + B) beneficiaries, cardiovascular events [myocardial infarction, stroke\u00a0and cardiovascular death; 1.05 (0.79-1.39)] and infectious events [hospitalization\/death; 0.96 (0.85-1.08)] did not differ between the iron exposure groups.\nIn incident HD patients, ferumoxytol showed similar short- to mid-term safety profiles with regard to cardiovascular, infectious and mortality outcomes compared with the more commonly used intravenous iron formulations IS and FG.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f61000317f","authors":["Airy, Medha","Mandayam, Sreedhar","Mitani, Aya A","Chang, Tara I","Ding, Victoria Y","Brookhart, M Alan","Goldstein, Benjamin A","Winkelmayer, Wolfgang C","Medha Airy","Sreedhar Mandayam","Aya A.
