The patients kept a personal journal, were contacted daily by a nurse, and then followed up by a surgeon at 1\u00a0week and 3\u00a0months.\nIn total, 155 patients were included, of which 54 were men; the mean age of the patients was 57.4\u00a0years. At the time of diagnosis, the mean C-reactive protein and white blood cell count were 73\u00a0mg\/l and 10.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910(9), respectively, and normalized in the vast majority of patients within the first week. The majority of the patients (97.4\u00a0%) were managed successfully as outpatients without antibiotics, admissions, or complications. In only four (2.6\u00a0%) patients, the management failed because of complications in three and deterioration in one. These patients were all treated successfully as inpatients without surgery. Five patients had recurrences and were treated as outpatients without antibiotics. Follow-up colonic investigations revealed cancer in two patients and polyps in 13 patients.\nPrevious results of low complication rates with the non-antibiotic policy were confirmed. The new policy of outpatient management without antibiotics in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is now shown to be feasible, well functioning, and safe.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b2e","authors":["D.
