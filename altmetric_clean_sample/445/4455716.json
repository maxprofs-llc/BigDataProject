The resolution of the disease occurs in the first twelve weeks postpartum. The behavior of blood pressure and occurrence of very high blood pressure episodes among women with severe preeclampsia is related to remodeling of the dynamics of body fluids with consequent increase in intravascular volume. The persistence of hypertension in critical levels results in increased puerperal morbidity.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of furosemide in accelerating blood pressure recovery among women with severe preeclampsia.\nA triple-masked placebo controlled clinical trial, will be conducted including 120 postpartum women with severe preeclampsia, after eclampsia prophylaxis with magnesium sulfate and with adequate diuresis. Women with chronic hypertension and users of diuretics will be deleted. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Patients will be randomized to receive furosemide (40\u00a0mg orally every twenty four hours) or placebo. The variables are systolic and diastolic blood pressure, frequency of hypertensive crises, need for maintenance of antihypertensive therapy, number of antihypertensive agents used to control blood pressure, urine output, length of hospital stay, adverse effects and maternal complications. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee in humans of our institution. All participants will be duly informed about the aims of the project and will be included only if they agree to participate voluntarily, signing the informed consent.\nThis study was registered on Clinical Trials.gov under the number NCT02163655 .
