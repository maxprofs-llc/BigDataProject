Patient demographics, surgical characteristics, radiographic evaluation and complications were recorded from the patients' charts. Questionnaires were sent by postal mail to all patients, to measure patient satisfaction and pain (VAS scales).\n161 patients were included in the trial. A wound infection was found in 8 (5%) patients. 3 were regarded as serious infections requiring hospitalisation and intravenous antibiotics, 2 of those required surgical revisions. 5 patients were treated by oral antibiotics. Staphylococcus aureus was identified as the causing organism in all (6\/8) cases with a positive culture. The patients with postoperative infection reported more pain (5.3 vs. 2.3; p=0.02) and were less satisfied (4.7 vs. 7.6; p=0.014) with their ankle compared to those without infection (T-test for independent samples).\nThere were 5% wound infections after routine syndesmotic screw removal. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis effective against S. aureus should be administered when removing syndesmotic screws. In our institution we now use one single dose Cefalotin of 2g intravenously 30-60min before screw removal.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ade","authors":["Andersen, Mette Renate","Frihagen, Frede","Madsen, Jan Erik","Figved, Wender","Mette Renate Andersen","Frede Frihagen","Jan Erik Madsen","Wender Figved"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.injury.2015.08.021","first_seen_on":"2015-08-31T18:44:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0020-1383","1879-0267","00201383"],"issue":"11","journal":"Injury","last_mentioned_on":1495662928,"links":["http:\/\/www.injuryjournal.com\/article\/S0020-1383%2815%2900496-9\/abstract","http:\/\/authors.elsevier.com\/a\/1RxQm4b3H7Bmf","http:\/\/www.injuryjournal.com\/article\/S0020-1383%2815%2900496-9\/abstract#.VeSfeg2g-OE.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.injuryjournal.com\/article\/S0020138315004969\/pdf","pmid":"26319204","pubdate":"2015-09-01T22:01:29+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"title":"High complication rate after syndesmotic screw removal","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-complication-rate-after-syndesmotic-screw-removal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.7,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":1.85,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8261086,"mean":6.9752528681095,"rank":1916920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6328469,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8261086,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231395,"mean":9.1549153132752,"rank":61187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":169523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231395,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1417,"mean":4.8806002824859,"rank":378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":1037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1417,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":9.8613043478261,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
