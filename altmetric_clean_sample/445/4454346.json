H. influenzae is one of several human-restricted bacteria, which bind to carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) on the epithelium leading to bacterial uptake by the eukaryotic cells. Adhesion to CEACAMs is thought to be mediated by the H. influenzae outer membrane protein (OMP) P5. However, CEACAMs still bound to H. influenzae lacking OMP P5 expression, and soluble CEACAM receptor ectodomains failed to bind to OMP P5, when heterologously expressed in E. coli. Screening of a panel of H. influenzae OMP mutants revealed that lack of OMP P1 completely abrogated CEACAM binding and supressed CEACAM-mediated engulfment of H. influenzae by epithelial cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of OMP P1 in E. coli was sufficient to induce CEACAM-binding and to promote attachment to and internalization into CEACAM-expressing cells. Interestingly, OMP P1 selectively recognizes human CEACAMs, but not homologs from other mammals and this binding preference is preserved upon expression in E. coli. Together, our data identify OMP P1 as the bona-fide CEACAM-binding invasin of H. influenzae. This is the first report providing evidence for an involvement of the major outer membrane protein P1 of H. influenzae in pathogenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f610003118","authors":["Tchoupa, Arnaud Kengmo","Lichtenegger, Sabine","Reidl, Joachim","Hauck, Christof R","Hauck, Christof R."],"doi":"10.1111\/mmi.13134","endpage":"455","first_seen_on":"2015-08-31T09:29:39+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2958"],"issue":"3","journal":"Molecular Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1441783936,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1111\/mmi.13134\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mmi.13134\/pdf","pmid":"26179342","pubdate":"2015-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"440","subjects":["molecularbiology","microbiology"],"title":"Outer membrane protein P1 is the CEACAM\u2010binding adhesin of Haemophilus influenzae","type":"article","volume":"98","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outer-membrane-protein-p1-ceacambinding-adhesin-haemophilus-influenzae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6467243,"mean":5.9727661553405,"rank":2479665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3912439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6467243,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196878,"mean":9.4693844786338,"rank":79008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":115266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196878,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2223,"mean":2.8185139513951,"rank":1176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":1036,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2223,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":1.3905714285714,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
