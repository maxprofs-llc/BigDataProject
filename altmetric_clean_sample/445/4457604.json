Here we describe a patient with an interstitial deletion of the Xq21.1 chromosome.\nIn a 15\u00a0year boy, showing intellectual disability, short stature, hearing loss and dysmorphic facial features, a deletion at Xq21.1 was identified by array-CGH. This maternally inherited 5.8\u00a0Mb rearrangement encompasses 14 genes, including BRWD3 (involved in X-linked intellectual disability), TBX22 (a gene whose alterations have been related to the presence of cleft palate), POU3F4 (mutated in X-linked deafness) and ITM2A (a gene involved in cartilage development).\nCorrelation between the clinical findings and the function of gene mapping within the deleted region confirms the causative role of this microrearrangement in our patient and provides new insight into a gene possibly involved in short stature.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007c1","authors":["Giordano, M","Gertosio, C","Pagani, S","Meazza, C","Fusco, I","Bozzola, E","Bozzola, M"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12881-015-0220-z","first_seen_on":"2015-09-01T06:45:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2350"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Medical Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1445345192,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2350\/16\/74?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26323392?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12881-015-0220-z.pdf","pmid":"26323392","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gene Function","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"74","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"A 5.8\u00a0Mb interstitial deletion on chromosome Xq21.1 in a boy with intellectual disability, cleft palate, hearing impairment and combined growth hormone deficiency.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/58mb-interstitial-deletion-chromosome-xq211-boy-intellectual-disability-cleft-palate-hearing-impairm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6348733,"mean":5.9808086398984,"rank":4691880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":943846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6348733,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186661,"mean":9.7902656059146,"rank":127882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":38320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186661,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":483,"mean":2.6321659751037,"rank":323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":483,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":2.1277777777778,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
