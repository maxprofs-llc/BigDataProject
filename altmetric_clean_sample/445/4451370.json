(1993) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1170, 211-215) and cDNA from the colonic carcinoma cell line LIM 1215 as template. The mature human GBP is 90% identical to the porcine GBP. Clones encoding the human GBP gene, which contains 19 exons, have been isolated from human genomic libraries. The positions of the exon\/intron junctions are completely different from the junctions in the gene encoding the related peroxisomal trifunctional enzyme. Clones encoding a related pseudogene have also been isolated and sequenced.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["Zhang, Q X","Baldwin, G S"],"first_seen_on":"2015-08-30T01:02:24+00:00","issns":["0006-3002"],"issue":"2","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1438505881,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7918661"],"pmid":"7918661","pubdate":"1994-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Structures of the human cDNA and gene encoding the 78 kDa gastrin-binding protein and of a related pseudogene.","type":"article","volume":"1219","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structures-human-cdna-gene-encoding-78-kda-gastrinbinding-protein-related-pseudogene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5436647,"mean":6.3270035691119,"rank":1373672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3441632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5436647,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190173,"mean":9.5440746797637,"rank":58873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":129142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190173,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4564,"mean":2.754597413982,"rank":464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":1819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4564,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170,"mean":2.2471360946746,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"HADHA","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=674196320#altmetric_citation_173d5301-dbec-4e0d-bb4a-098c24f768e5","license":"public","citation_ids":[4451370],"posted_on":"2015-08-02T08:58:01+00:00","summary":"Trifunctional enzyme subunit alpha, mitochondrial also known as hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase\/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase\/enoyl-CoA hydratase (trifunctional protein), alpha subunit is a protein that in humans is encoded by the HADHA gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=10305718","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Yobot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Yobot"}}]}}
