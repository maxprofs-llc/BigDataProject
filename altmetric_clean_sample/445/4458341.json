Munc18-2 plays a role in the degranulation machinery of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Mutations in STXBP2\/Munc18-2 lead to impaired killing of target cells by NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which in turn results in elevated levels of the inflammatory cytokine IFN-\u03b3, macrophage activation and hemophagocytosis. Even though FHL-5 patients present with anemia and hemolysis, no link between the disease and the erythroid lineage has been established. Here we show that red blood cells (RBC) express Munc18-2 and that erythroid cells from FHL-5 patients exhibit intrinsic defects due to STXBP2\/Munc18-2 mutations. RBC from FHL-5 patients expose less phosphatidylserine on their surface upon Ca(2+) ionophore ionomycin treatment. Furthermore, cultured erythroblasts from FHL-5 patients display defective erythropoiesis characterized by decreased CD235a expression and aberrant cell morphology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002895","authors":["Kostova, E B","Beuger, B M","Veldthuis, M","van der Werff Ten Bosch, J","K\u00fchnle, I","van den Akker, E","van den Berg, T K","van Zwieten, R","van Bruggen, R"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.exphem.2015.08.007","first_seen_on":"2015-09-01T10:08:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2399"],"journal":"Experimental Hematology","last_mentioned_on":1458392390,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26320718?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26320718?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26320718","pubdate":"2015-09-01T22:00:54+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Intrinsic defects in erythroid cells from familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 5 patients identify a role for STXBP2\/Munc18-2 in erythropoiesis and phospholipid scrambling.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intrinsic-defects-erythroid-cells-familial-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis-type-5-patients-identi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7410208,"mean":6.44364379996,"rank":5346428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1803919,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7410208,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227567,"mean":8.9090284225236,"rank":142259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":70778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227567,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":421,"mean":2.741019047619,"rank":275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":421,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.2363636363636,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
