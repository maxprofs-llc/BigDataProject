Older (n = 74) and younger parents (n = 71) completed self-report measures to assess personal competencies and social resources (third trimester of pregnancy), psychological distress, and quality of life (third trimester of pregnancy and 1-month' postpartum) and parenting self-perceptions (1-month' postpartum). Older parents were more similar than different from younger parents regarding personal competencies, social resources, and psychosocial adjustment during the first postnatal month. Regardless of the age group, higher personal competencies and social resources predicted lower anxiety and more positive parenting self-perceptions in women. Beyond higher personal competencies, older maternal age also predicted higher quality of life. In men, higher personal competencies were protective against anxiety, but only at older maternal age.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ac2","authors":["Guedes, Maryse","Canavarro, Maria Cristina"],"doi":"10.1002\/imhj.21528","endpage":"521","first_seen_on":"2015-08-31T13:59:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1097-0355"],"issue":"5","journal":"Infant Mental Health Journal","last_mentioned_on":1441031637,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/imhj.21528","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/imhj.21528&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/imhj.21528\/pdf","pmid":"26331727","pubdate":"2015-09-04T22:01:52+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"506","title":"PERSONAL COMPETENCIES, SOCIAL RESOURCES, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ADJUSTMENT OF PRIMIPAROUS WOMEN OF ADVANCED MATERNAL AGE AND THEIR PARTNERS","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/personal-competencies-social-resources-psychosocial-adjustment-primiparous-women-advanced-maternal-a-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6420611,"mean":5.9912694360814,"rank":4748206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":949459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6420611,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189832,"mean":9.7125705601298,"rank":130610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":38176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189832,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223,"mean":2.3924414414414,"rank":169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.625,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ThihaSwe_dr\/statuses\/638350427612811264","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4454900],"posted_on":"2015-08-31T13:59:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Psychiatry Updates","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PsychiatryUpdates.by.DrThihaSwe","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3471096253\/6b7bd3fc313986902cd1574474364bae_normal.jpeg","description":"[RSS Updates from Psychiatry Journals globally, plus some mental health related news] \/ Should follow only if you are interested in Mental Health","id_on_source":"ThihaSwe_dr","tweeter_id":"1259166031","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":997},"tweet_id":"638350427612811264"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/actualidad_ps\/statuses\/638359071117066240","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4454900],"posted_on":"2015-08-31T14:33:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Actualidad en Ps","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/actualidadps","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000596612453\/58acc473dd764fa87ab748120097de31_normal.jpeg","description":"Revisi\u00f3n de los principales acontecimientos en el mundo de la psicolog\u00eda","id_on_source":"actualidad_ps","tweeter_id":"1961113322","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":229},"tweet_id":"638359071117066240"}]}}
