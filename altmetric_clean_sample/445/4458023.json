As per Quay and in light of Barkley's model, anxiety may have a protective effect on cognitive deficits and behaviors associated with ADHD. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of treating AD on cognitive deficits and behaviors associated with ADHD in children with both disorders. Twenty-four children with ADHD and AD were divided into two groups: treatment for AD, and wait list. Participants were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up with the ADIS-C, the CBCL, and neuropsychological measures. The results revealed a significant improvement in automatic response inhibition and flexibility, and a decrease in inattention\/hyperactivity behaviors following the treatment for AD. No significant differences were observed in motor response inhibition, working memory, or attention deficits. The results do not seem to support Quay's hypothesis: treating AD did not exacerbate cognitive deficits and behaviors associated with ADHD in our sample.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002506","authors":["Isabelle Denis","Marie-Claude Guay","Guillaume Foldes-Busque","Leila BenAmor"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10578-015-0584-5","first_seen_on":"2015-09-01T09:27:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-3327"],"journal":"Child Psychiatry & Human Development","last_mentioned_on":1441099456,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10578-015-0584-5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10578-015-0584-5.pdf","pmid":"26323585","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Child and School Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry","pediatrics"],"title":"Effect of Treating Anxiety Disorders on Cognitive Deficits and Behaviors Associated with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Preliminary Study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-treating-anxiety-disorders-cognitive-deficits-behaviors-associated-attention-deficit-hyperact-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5578753,"mean":6.3898123060521,"rank":4646947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5578753,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194359,"mean":9.5157131993539,"rank":155627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194359,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312,"mean":3.4723536977492,"rank":246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":3.0070588235294,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
