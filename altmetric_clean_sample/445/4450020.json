Our previous studies identified a salt-tolerant tomato cultivar, LA2711, which is also a fast-germinating genotype, compared to its salt-sensitive counterpart, ZS-5. In an effort to further clarify the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we compared the dynamic levels of ABA and GA4, the transcript abundance of genes involved in their biosynthesis and catabolism as well as signal transduction between the two cultivars. In addition, we tested seed germination sensitivity to ABA and GAs. Our results revealed that insensitivity of seed germination to exogenous ABA and low ABA content in seeds are the physiological mechanisms conferring faster germination rates of LA2711 seeds. SlCYP707A2, which encodes an ABA catabolic enzyme, may play a decisive role in the fast germination rate of LA2711, as it showed a significantly higher level of expression in LA2711 than ZS-5 at most time points tested during germination. The current results will enable us to gain insight into the mechanism(s) regarding seed germination of tomato and the role of fast germination in stress tolerance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333d","authors":["Yang, Rongchao","Chu, Zhuannan","Zhang, Haijun","Li, Ying","Wang, Jinfang","Li, Dianbo","Weeda, Sarah","Ren, Shuxin","Ouyang, Bo","Guo, Yang-Dong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.plantsci.2015.06.012","first_seen_on":"2015-08-29T13:51:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2259","01689452"],"journal":"Plant Science","last_mentioned_on":1438849800,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0168945215001788"],"pmid":"26259191","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"The mechanism underlying fast germination of tomato cultivar LA2711 ","type":"article","volume":"238","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanism-underlying-fast-germination-tomato-cultivar-la2711"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5450695,"mean":6.347149723687,"rank":4535992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5450695,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192645,"mean":9.470724683873,"rank":154140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192645,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":490,"mean":2.025754601227,"rank":329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":490,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":0.70555555555556,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
