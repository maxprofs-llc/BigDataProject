Metabolic coupling has long been considered a key mechanism through which astrocytes and neurons actively interact in response of neuronal activity, but recent findings suggested that disrupting metabolic coupling may represent an innovative approach to prevent memory formation, in particular drug-related memories. Here, we review converging evidence illustrating how memory and addiction share neural circuitry and molecular mechanisms implicating lactate-mediated metabolic coupling between astrocytes and neurons. With several aspects of addiction depending on mnemonic processes elicited by drug experience, disrupting lactate transport involved in the formation of a pathological learning, linking the incentive, and motivational effects of drugs with drug-conditioned stimuli represent a promising approach to encourage abstinence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023cb","authors":["Boury\u2010Jamot, Benjamin","Halfon, Olivier","Magistretti, Pierre J.","Boutrel, Benjamin","Boury-Jamot, Benjamin","Magistretti, Pierre J"],"doi":"10.1002\/bies.201600118","first_seen_on":"2016-10-04T11:40:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-1878"],"journal":"BioEssays","last_mentioned_on":1475949597,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bies.201600118\/abstract;jsessionid=506E2D0EC876561BB11495D984E89A2F.f04t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bies.201600118\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bies.201600118\/pdf","pmid":"27699812","pubdate":"2016-10-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","biology"],"title":"Lactate release from astrocytes to neurons contributes to cocaine memory formation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lactate-release-astrocytes-neurons-contributes-cocaine-memory-formation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7506617,"mean":6.4985319251666,"rank":3655232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3661780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7506617,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239989,"mean":12.532273538677,"rank":121502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":109719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239989,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1352,"mean":6.1531769059956,"rank":913,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1352,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":5.5172,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/783270552160997376","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12419956],"posted_on":"2016-10-04T11:40:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":964},"tweet_id":"783270552160997376"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/neuromaniacx\/statuses\/784517449781608448","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12419956],"posted_on":"2016-10-07T22:15:10+00:00","author":{"name":"neuromaniac","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/715668461351874560\/y6vaG1dR_normal.jpg","description":"Neuroscience watcher; digging out classic papers, etc.\r\nFeatures papers that matter.
