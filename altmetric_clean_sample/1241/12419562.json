However, achieving ADA glucose targets safely, without hypoglycemia, is challenging. In this study we evaluated the safety and efficacy of basal bolus subcutaneous (SubQ) insulin therapy managed by providers compared to a nurse-directed Electronic Glycemic Management System (eGMS).\nThis retrospective crossover study evaluated 993 non-ICU patients treated with subcutaneous basal bolus insulin therapy managed by a provider compared to an eGMS. Analysis compared therapy outcomes before Glucommander (BGM), during Glucommander (DGM), and after Glucommander (AGM) for all patients. The blood glucose (BG) target was set at 140-180 mg\/dL for all groups. The safety of each was evaluated by the following: (1) BG averages, (2) hypoglycemic events <40 and <70 mg\/dL, and (3) percentage of BG in target.\nPercentage of BG in target was BGM 47%, DGM 62%, and AGM 36%. Patients' BGM BG average was 195 mg\/dL, DGM BG average was 169 mg\/dL, and AGM BG average was 174 mg\/dL. Percentage of hypoglycemic events <70 mg\/dL was 2.6% BGM, 1.9% DGM, and 2.8% AGM treatment.\nPatients using eGMS in the DGM group achieved improved glycemic control with lower incidence of hypoglycemia (<40 mg\/dL and <70 mg\/dl) compared to both BGM and AGM management with standard treatment. These results suggest that an eGMS can safely maintain glucose control with less hypoglycemia than basal bolus treatment managed by a provider.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c3b","authors":["Joseph Aloi","Bruce W.
