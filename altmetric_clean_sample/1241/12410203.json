The thickness of the transversus abdominis, internal oblique and erector spinae muscles and area of the multifidus muscle were measured bilaterally via real-time ultrasound. 'Intent to treat' analysis was implemented and p-values were adjusted by the false discovery rate method.\nAt end-bed-rest, transversus abdominis thickness was reduced by 18.3% in the inactive group (p=0.00011) with no significant change in the RVE (-4.0%; p=0.014 versus control) or RE (-5.0%; p=0.10 versus control) groups. In the inactive subjects, internal oblique thickness reduced by 10.6% (p=0.0025) and by 7% (p>0.05) in each of the training groups. Lengthening of the lumbar spine was greatest on day 1 (+7.4%, p=0.004) and 2 (+6.3%, p=0.004; day 54: +4.1%, p=0.023). Extensor atrophy and spinal lengthening was not impacted by exercise. No significant difference was seen between RVE and RE.\nBed-rest leads to atrophy of the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles. The exercise program, which implemented lower-limb and back extension exercises against shoulder restraints, was able to reduce atrophy seen in transversus abdominis in bed-rest.","authors":["Belav\u00fd, Daniel L.","Gast, Ulf","Felsenberg, Dieter","BELAV\u00c3\u009d, DANIEL LUDOVIC","GAST, ULF","FELSENBERG, DIETER"],"doi":"10.1249\/mss.0000000000001096","first_seen_on":"2016-10-03T22:23:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1530-0315","0195-9131"],"issue":"2","journal":"Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise","last_mentioned_on":1484766550,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/acsm-msse\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Exercise_and_Transversus_Abdominis_Muscle_Atrophy.97391.aspx","http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/acsm-msse\/_layouts\/15\/oaks.journals.mobile\/articleviewer.aspx?year=2017&issue=02000&article=00003"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/acsm-msse\/9000\/00000\/Exercise_and_Transversus_Abdominis_Muscle_Atrophy.97391.pdf","pmid":"27685010","pubdate":"2016-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","startpage":"1","subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Exercise and Transversus Abdominis Muscle Atrophy after 60 d Bed Rest","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/acsm-msse\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Exercise_and_Transversus_Abdominis_Muscle_Atrophy.97391.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exercise-transversus-abdominis-muscle-atrophy-after-60-d-bed-rest"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":2.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
