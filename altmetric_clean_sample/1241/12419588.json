A balance study was done between 21 and 30 days after birth. Nitrogen retention expressed as milligram per kilogram per 100 kcal of metabolizable energy was greater with the 60:40 whey\/casein and with the casein hydrolysate preparations than with the 20:80 whey\/casein formula, which provided the same amount of energy (150 kcal\/kg\/day) but smaller quantities of protein (3.5 g\/kg\/day) than the two others (4.3 g\/kg\/day and 4.4 g\/kg\/day). Weight gain until discharge from the hospital and increment of height and head circumference over a three-month period showed an advantage of the two formulas providing higher intakes of protein. This study suggests that with high-energy intakes, protein quality does not affect nitrogen retention and growth unless the quantity of protein ingested falls below a critical level.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005702","authors":["Darling, P","Lepage, G","Tremblay, P","Collet, S","Kien, L C","Roy, C C"],"first_seen_on":"2016-10-04T11:19:53+00:00","issns":["0002-922X"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal of Diseases of Children","last_mentioned_on":1475508543,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3872061"],"pmid":"3872061","pubdate":"1985-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Protein quality and quantity in preterm infants receiving the same energy intake.","type":"article","volume":"139","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protein-quality-quantity-preterm-infants-receiving-same-energy-intake"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7474500,"mean":6.4836868429538,"rank":6473673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7474500,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239571,"mean":12.529571223442,"rank":198006,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239571,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":449,"mean":3.8926071428571,"rank":425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":449,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
