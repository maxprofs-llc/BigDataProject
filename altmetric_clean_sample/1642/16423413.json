It has been shown that psoriasis patients have an increased incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease over controls. Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and psoriasis have more severe skin disease and are at higher risk of severe liver fibrosis than patients without psoriasis. The authors will review the diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and also discuss lifestyle changes and treatments for psoriasis that may benefit or worsen nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f9c","authors":["Ronald Prussick","Lisa Prussick","Dillon Nussbaum"],"first_seen_on":"2017-02-15T14:59:05+00:00","issns":["1941-2789"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Clinical & Aesthetic Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1487166092,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4382145\/"],"pmid":"25852814","pubdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Matrix Medical Communications","startpage":"43","title":"Nonalcoholic Fatty liver disease and psoriasis: what a dermatologist needs to know.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-psoriasis-dermatologist-needs-know"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8213437,"mean":6.9553152651275,"rank":1191494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6947678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8213437,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293420,"mean":12.575665781697,"rank":63603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":225950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293420,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230,"mean":6.0277903930131,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.4375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Natural Treatment For Psoriasis Unlinks The Condition To Type 2 Diabetes With Unlimited Healing","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=29597520759&p=1pl&v=1&x=F_VFCd99ZNmj5YZSUl271w","license":"public","citation_ids":[7020452,16423413,16423415],"posted_on":"2017-02-15T13:41:32+00:00","summary":"According to a recent twin study, there\u2019s a genetic link between obesity, psoriasis and diabetes.","author":{"name":"Emaxhealth.com","url":"http:\/\/www.emaxhealth.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/830\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2016-02-02_at_15.42.33.png?1454427767"}}]}}
