Human behavior sits on the final common pathway to so many of our health and health care goals, including the prevention and management of illness and the fostering of wellness. Behavioral economics is a relatively new field offering approaches to supplement many of the conventional approaches to improving health behaviors that rely on education or standard economic theory. While those conventional approaches presume that an educated public will naturally make decisions that optimize personal welfare, approaches derived from behavioral economics harness existing and predictable patterns of behavior that often lead people to make choices against their best interests. By keeping these predictable patterns of behavior in mind when designing health insurance, health care programs, or the health-related aspects of everyday life, behavioral economists aim to meet people half-way: no longer asking them to reshape their behavior to something more health promoting, but helping the behavioral patterns they already follow lead them to better health.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003403","authors":["Volpp, K.G.","Asch, D.A."],"doi":"10.1093\/qjmed\/hcw190","first_seen_on":"2017-02-15T14:25:50+00:00","issns":["1460-2725","1460-2393"],"journal":"QJM: An International Journal of Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1500471004,"links":["https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/qjmed\/article-abstract\/doi\/10.1093\/qjmed\/hcw190\/2638391\/Make-the-healthy-choice-the-easy-choice-using?redirectedFrom=fulltext","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/qjmed\/article\/110\/5\/271\/2638391\/Make-the-healthy-choice-the-easy-choice-using"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/qjmed\/article-pdf\/doi\/10.1093\/qjmed\/hcw190\/8256726\/hcw190.pdf","pmid":"27803366","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Make the Healthy Choice the Easy Choice: Using Behavioral Economics to Advance a Culture of Health","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/qjmed\/article-lookup\/doi\/10.1093\/qjmed\/hcw190","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/make-healthy-choice-easy-choice-using-behavioral-economics-advance-culture-health"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.45,"score_history":{"1y":4.45,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8377430,"mean":7.0593661138679,"rank":1774710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6595401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8377430,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":307061,"mean":12.356715378101,"rank":87947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":218505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":307061,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1200,"mean":5.0084153461218,"rank":299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1200,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.2307692307692,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
