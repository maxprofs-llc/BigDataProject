In controlled environments, including liquid hydroponics, height of the dwarf cultivar \"Hoyt\" was reduced from 46 to 33 cm when plants were grown under metal halide lamps compared to high pressure sodium lamps at the same photosynthetic photon flux. Metal halide lamps reduced total biomass 14% but did not significantly reduce seed yield. Neither increasing temperature nor altering the difference between day\/night temperature affected plant height. Increasing temperature from 21 to 27 degrees C increased yield 32%. High temperature significantly increased carbon partitioning to stems and increased harvest index.","ads_id":"1997AdSpR..20.1895D","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002194","authors":["T.A.O.
