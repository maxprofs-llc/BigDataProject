HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal\/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio (INR), elderly >65\u00a0years, drugs\/alcohol concomitantly) score includes \"labile INR\" referred to quality of anticoagulation. However, in na\u00efve patients, this item is not available. In addition, stroke and bleeding risk prediction scores shared several risk factors. The aims of our study were as follows: (1) to evaluate if the HAS-BLED score in its refined form excluding \"labile INR\" (HAS-BED [hypertension, abnormal renal\/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, elderly, drugs\/alcohol]) is still associated with bleeding risk and (2) to evaluate the predictive ability for bleeding of both stroke and bleeding prediction models. We followed an inception cohort of 4,579 patients with AF enrolled in the Survey on anticoagulaTed pAtients RegisTer (NCT02219984). Major bleeds were recorded. During follow-up (7,014 patient-years), 115 patients experienced a major bleeding (MB; rate 1.6\u00a0\u00d7 100 patient-years). Patients at high risk were better identified by HAS-BLED and HAS-BED scores with respect to CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age >75\u00a0years, diabetes, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack) and CHA2DS2VASc (congestive heart, failure, hypertension, age [>75\u00a0years], diabetes, stroke\/transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age [65 to 74\u00a0years], female gender). HAS-BLED has a slightly higher c value in comparison to CHADS2 and CHA2DS2VASc. However, among na\u00efve patients, the predictive ability for hemorrhage of HAS-BED score is overlapping with CHADS2 and CHA2DS2VASc. In low stroke risk patients (CHA2DS2VASc\u00a0= 0 to 1), only 6 patients are at high bleeding risk, and none of them experienced MB. In conclusion, in our prospective cohort of patients with AF, we found that HAS-BLED and HAS-BED scores identify patients at high bleeding risk. However, the predictive value for MB of HAS-BED used in na\u00efve patients is similar to CHADS2 or CHA2DS2VASc, suggesting that stroke stratification scores could be sufficient for tailoring treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f0","authors":["Daniela Poli","Emilia Antonucci","Vittorio Pengo","Sophie Testa","Gualtiero Palareti"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjcard.2016.12.007","first_seen_on":"2017-04-28T01:46:04+00:00","issns":["00029149"],"journal":"American Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1495580234,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28237286?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28237286","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Comparison of HAS-BLED and HAS-BED Versus CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 VASC Stroke and Bleeding Scores in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-hasbled-hasbed-versus-chads2-cha2ds2vasc-stroke-bleeding-scores-patients-atrial-fibrillat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":4149600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3894583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242948,"mean":12.62622695485,"rank":122625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":109999,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242948,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4308,"mean":4.9233002089622,"rank":2316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4308,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155,"mean":3.2768831168831,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
