It finds diverse food applications such as that of a gelling agent, stabilizer, and fat replacer. In the pharmaceutical arena, pectin exhibits a number of functions, from decreasing blood fat to combating various types of cancers. This review shows the shift of pectin from its conventional roles to its progressive applications. Insights into the advances in the production of pectin, the role it plays as a nutraceutical, possible prebiotic potential and a delivery vehicle for probiotics, and food applications are highlighted. Bioactive and functional properties of pectin are discussed and how the structural built up defines them, is emphasized. As a biopolymer, the applications of pectin in active packaging are also mentioned.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024a4","authors":["Farah Naqash","F.A. Masoodi","Sajad Ahmad Rather","S.M.
