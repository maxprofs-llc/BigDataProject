Criteria for diagnosing daptomycin-induced AEP varies and generally includes bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) eosinophils \u2265\u00a025%. We report a case of a 70-year-old woman with cough, shortness of breath, and altered mental status who presented ~\u00a09\u00a0days after starting therapy with daptomycin to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) osteomyelitis. Daptomycin was utilized because of a presumed vancomycin allergy. Aspiration pneumonia was suspected and IV ampicillin and sulbactam was initiated. Clinical status improved initially but ~\u00a01\u00a0week later, her respiratory status declined. During work-up, peripheral eosinophils were abnormal at 11.6%, so daptomycin therapy was discontinued. BAL revealed 5% eosinophils with negative infectious work-up. Respiratory status rapidly improved after discontinuation of daptomycin. Linezolid therapy was initiated. Due to an uncertain association with daptomycin and concerns associated with long-term linezolid therapy, the patient agreed to rechallenge with daptomycin. Within 24 hours, respiratory symptoms returned and daptomycin was permanently discontinued. The patient rapidly recovered without the need for systemic corticosteroid treatment.\nOur case supports a broadened definition of pulmonary eosinophilia associated with daptomycin administration. It is important for clinicians to consider daptomycin as an etiology of pneumonia with abnormal eosinophils when other causes have been excluded. Clinicians could also consider peripheral eosinophilia as a possible indication of AEP when BAL is not available or cannot be obtained.\u2029.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f610007851","authors":["Melanie Nickerson","Ashish Bhargava","Pramodini Kale-Pradhan"],"doi":"10.5414\/cp202952","first_seen_on":"2017-04-24T08:23:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0946-1965"],"journal":"International Journal of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1493022189,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28406091?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28406091","pubdate":"2017-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Daptomycin-associated eosinophilic pneumonia with rechallenge: a case report","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8093859,"mean":6.8854427063012,"rank":6146780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1086782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8093859,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233398,"mean":12.676812204098,"rank":165200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43499,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233398,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253,"mean":2.8326746031746,"rank":171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.33333333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mrsawatch\/statuses\/856423252259766273","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19507618],"posted_on":"2017-04-24T08:23:09+00:00","author":{"name":"MRSA Watch","url":"http:\/\/tahilla.typepad.com\/mrsawatch","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1222035691\/MRSA_9_normal.jpg","description":"MRSA News","id_on_source":"mrsawatch","tweeter_id":"41137185","geo":{"lt":48.85341,"ln":2.3488,"country":"FR"},"followers":1129},"tweet_id":"856423252259766273"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mrsainfection\/statuses\/856423251664228352","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19507618],"posted_on":"2017-04-24T08:23:09+00:00","author":{"name":"MRSA INFECTION","url":"http:\/\/www.mrsainfection.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1222048374\/MRSA_6_normal.jpg","description":"MRSA Information","id_on_source":"mrsainfection","tweeter_id":"36626253","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":723},"tweet_id":"856423251664228352"}]}}
