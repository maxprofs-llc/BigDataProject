The novel aspects of this work reside in the fact that a TWIMS arrangement was used to obtain a high level structural information including location of fatty acyl substituents and double bonds for PCs in plasma, and the presence of alkali metal adduct ions such as [M\u2009+\u2009Li](+) was not required to obtain double bond positions. Elemental compositions for fragment ions were confirmed by accurate mass measurements. A very specific first generation fragment ion m\/z 577 (M-phosphoryl choline) from the PC [16:0\/18:1 (9Z)] was produced, which by further CID generated acylium ions containing either the fatty acyl 16:0 (C(15)H(31)CO(+), m\/z 239) or 18:1 (9Z) (C(17)H(33)CO(+), m\/z 265) substituent. Subsequent water loss from these acylium ions was key in producing hydrocarbon fragment ions mainly from the \u03b1-proximal position of the carbonyl group such as the hydrocarbon ion m\/z 67 (+H(2)C-HC\u2009=\u2009CH-CH\u2009=\u2009CH(2)). Formation of these ions was of important significance for determining double bonds in the fatty acyl chains. In addition to this, and with the aid of (13)C labeled lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) 18:1 (9Z) in the \u03c9-position (methyl) TAP fragmentation produced the ion at m\/z 57. And was proven to be derived from the \u03b1-proximal (carboxylate) or distant \u03c9-position (methyl) in the LPC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011JASMS..22.1552C","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f5d","authors":["Jose Castro-Perez","Thomas P.
