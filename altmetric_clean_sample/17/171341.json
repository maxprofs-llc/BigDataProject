See here: and Insofar as transition"],"citation":{"abstract":"Teacher self-efficacy refers to the beliefs teachers hold regarding their capability to bring about desired instructional outcomes and may be helpful for understanding and addressing critical issues such as teacher attrition and teacher use of research-supported practices. Educating students with autism likely presents teachers with some of the most significant instructional challenges. The self-efficacy of 35 special education teachers of students with autism between the ages of 3 to 9 years was evaluated. Teachers completed rating scales that represented self-efficacy and aspects of the following 3 of Bandura's 4 sources of self-efficacy: (1) sense of mastery, (2) social persuasions, and (3) physiological\/affective states. Significant associations were observed between physiological\/affective states and self-efficacy, but no associations were observed for the other sources.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028e9","authors":["Lisa A.
