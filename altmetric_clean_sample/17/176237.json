Stx2Al, Al subunit of Stx2 toxin has gathered extensive concerns due to its potential of being developed into a vaccine candidate. However, the substantial progress is hampered in part for the lack of a suitable in vitro expression system. Here we report use of the prokaryotic system pET-28a::espA-Stx2Al\/BL21 to carry out the fusion expression of Stx2Al which is linked to E. coli secreted protein A (EspA) at its N-terminus. Under the IPTG induction, EspA-Stx2Al fusion protein in the form of inclusion body was obtained successfully, whose expression level can reach about 40% of total bacterial protein at 25 degrees C, much higher than that at 37 degrees C. Western blot test suggested the refolded fusion protein is of excellent immuno-reactivity with both monoclonal antibodies, which are specific to EspA and Stx2Al, respectively. Anti-sera from Balb\/c mice immunized with the EspA-Stx2Al fusion protein were found to exhibit strong neutralization activity and protection capability in vitro and in vivo. These data have provided a novel feasible method to produce Stx2Al in large scale in vitro, which is implicated for the development of multivalent subunit vaccines candidate against EHEC 0157:H7 infections.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008b26","authors":["Yan Cheng","Youjun Feng","Ping Luo","Jiang Gu","Shu Yu","Wei-jun Zhang","Yan-qing Liu","Qing-xu Wang","Quan-ming Zou","Xu-hu Mao"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12275-009-0116-8","endpage":"505","issns":["1225-8873","1976-3794"],"issue":"4","journal":"The Journal of Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1309334570,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/u7700r23855p3682\/"],"pmid":"19763426","pubdate":"2009-09-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"498","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Fusion expression and immunogenicity of EHEC EspA-Stx2Al protein: Implications for the vaccine development","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fusion-expression-immunogenicity-ehec-espastx2al-protein-implications-vaccine-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":3109597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":999457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3441759,"mean":5.759165756331,"rank":2400608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":755088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3441759,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189,"mean":1.286829787234,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185,"mean":1.3039347826087,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":81,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
