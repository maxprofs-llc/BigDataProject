Its microtubular cytoskeleton mediates trophozoite motility, attachment and cytokinesis, and is characterised by an attachment disk and eight flagella that are each nucleated in a basal body. To date, only 10 giardial basal body proteins have been identified, including universal signalling proteins that are important for regulating mitosis or differentiation. In this study, we have exploited bioinformatics and proteomic approaches to identify new Giardia basal body proteins and confocal microscopy to confirm their localisation in interphase trophozoites. This approach identified 75 homologs of conserved basal body proteins in the genome including 65 not previously known to be associated with Giardia basal bodies. Thirteen proteins were confirmed to co-localise with centrin to the Giardia basal bodies. We also demonstrate that most basal body proteins localise to additional cytoskeletal structures in interphase trophozoites. This might help to explain the roles of the four pairs of flagella and Giardia-specific organelles in motility and differentiation. A deeper understanding of the composition of the Giardia basal bodies will contribute insights into the complex signalling pathways that regulate its unique cytoskeleton and the biological divergence of these conserved organelles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b0f","doi":"10.1016\/j.ijpara.2011.06.001","funders":["niaid","phs"],"issns":["1879-0135"],"journal":"International Journal for Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1318945986,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21723868","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSCONTENT&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0020751911001512&_version=1&md5=67331d7a02fa73a8171bf35830947c13&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"21723868","pubdate":"2011-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Mining the Giardia genome and proteome for conserved and unique basal body proteins.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mining-giardia-genome-proteome-conserved-unique-basal-body-proteins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":2319143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2591283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4034331,"mean":6.7323969615749,"rank":1938666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1992178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4034331,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":692,"mean":3.3364428364689,"rank":423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":692,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":625,"mean":3.3592820512821,"rank":384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":625,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
