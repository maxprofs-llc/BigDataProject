The genomes of the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and the centric diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana have been sequenced, revealing some characteristics of the diatoms' mosaic genome as well as some features of their fatty acid metabolism and urea cycle, and indicating their unusual properties. To identify microRNAs (miRNAs) from P. tricornutum and to study their probable roles in nitrogen and silicon metabolism, we constructed and sequenced small RNA (sRNA) libraries from P. tricornutum under normal (PT1), nitrogen-limited (PT2) and silicon-limited (PT3) conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-12-337","issns":["1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1309824168,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21718527?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21718527","pubdate":"2011-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Identification and characterization of microRNAs from Phaeodactylum tricornutum by high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-characterization-micrornas-phaeodactylum-tricornutum-highthroughput-sequencing-bioinf"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":3111503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1004078,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3441639,"mean":5.7499785770587,"rank":2400015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":759330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3441639,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4113,"mean":3.3173959143969,"rank":3040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4113,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3895,"mean":3.3315752439651,"rank":2884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3895,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":24,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
