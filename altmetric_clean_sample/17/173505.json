Here we show that PrP is required for the plasticity-impairing effects of ex vivo material from human AD brain and that standardized A\u03b2-derived diffusible ligand (ADDL) preparations disrupt hippocampal synaptic plasticity in a PrP-dependent manner. We screened a panel of anti-PrP antibodies for their ability to disrupt the ADDL-PrP interaction. Antibodies directed to the principal PrP\/A\u03b2-binding site and to PrP helix-1, were able to block A\u03b2 binding to PrP suggesting that the toxic A\u03b2 species are of relatively high molecular mass and\/or may bind multiple PrP molecules. Two representative and extensively characterized monoclonal antibodies directed to these regions, ICSM-35 and ICSM-18, were shown to block the A\u03b2-mediated disruption of synaptic plasticity validating these antibodies as candidate therapeutics for AD either individually or in combination.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011NatCo...2E.336F","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Darragh B.
