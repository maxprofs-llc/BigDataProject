The pineal gland has been implicated as influencing the predilection for the ethanol solution. Melatonin, a pineal hormone, was administered either daily for 11 weeks as a subcutaneous injection (25 micrograms\/animal) or weekly as a subcutaneous beeswax implant (1 mg melatonin\/24 mg beeswax) for 5 weeks to hamsters allowed a free-choice between water or a 10% ethanol solution. Food, water and alcohol consumptions were measured on a daily basis. Animals treated by daily injection with melatonin consumed slightly less ethanol than animals not given melatonin. In light-deprived animals given chronic implants of melatonin, alcohol consumption was reduced when compared to alcohol consumption by light-deprived hamsters not receiving melatonin. Melatonin treatment also resulted in reducing daily total fluid intake as well as ethanol consumption in light-deprived hamsters. The results indicate that the pineal gland may influence fluid consumption in the hamster, and indirectly alters the propensity of the hamster to consume alcohol.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032e3","issns":["0091-3057"],"issue":"2","journal":"Pharmacology, Biochemistry & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1369260823,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7193879"],"pmid":"7193879","pubdate":"1981-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology","behavioralsciences","pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Pineal gland and melatonin influence on chronic alcohol consumption by hamsters.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pineal-gland-melatonin-influence-chronic-alcohol-consumption-hamsters"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627775,"mean":4.946368885166,"rank":605214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3011191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627775,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726200,"mean":5.2308089446173,"rank":497309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":2220011,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726200,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":905,"mean":2.7777212389381,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":805,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":905,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":850,"mean":2.7766902237927,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":850,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":5},"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/psenka\/status\/85665530983354368","citation_ids":[175602],"posted_on":"2011-06-28T11:07:08+00:00","author":{"name":"psenka","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/492135272\/psenka-twitter-image_normal.jpg","description":"Father, wannabe stonemason and falconer.
