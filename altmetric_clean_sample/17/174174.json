"],"citation":{"abstract":"Recurrent myocardial ischaemia and restenosis are more common in diabetic patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) compared to patients without diabetes. Diabetes is also associated with increased residual platelet activity during dual antiplatelet treatment. In recent reports, platelet reactivity has been linked to outcomes after ACS. Appropriate platelet inhibition might lead to improved outcomes in this patient population. To this end, newest methods to evaluate platelet function may prove helpful.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90b3cf058f61000caac","issns":["0022-9032"],"issue":"6","journal":"Kardiologia polska","last_mentioned_on":1309122938,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21678284?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21678284","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Effects of platelet and inflammatory system activation on outcomes in diabetic patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention.","type":"article","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-platelet-inflammatory-system-activation-outcomes-diabetic-patients-st-segment-elevation-myoc-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630978,"mean":4.9279868812221,"rank":2898958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630978,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2728423,"mean":5.2157130979045,"rank":2150314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":59021,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2728423,"percentile":2},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261,"mean":0.97560769230769,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261,"mean":0.97656923076923,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
