In a previous study, we found that the rabbit external anal sphincter (EAS) operates on the ascending limb of the length-tension curve, in other words at lengths shorter than its optimal length (short sarcomere length). In this study, we tested whether the human EAS muscle also operates at a short sarcomere length.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003195","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2982.2011.01700.x","issns":["1365-2982"],"issue":"7","journal":"Neurogastroenterology & Motility","last_mentioned_on":1308969768,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21418426"],"pmid":"21418426","pubdate":"2011-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neurology","gastroenterology"],"title":"The external anal sphincter operates at short sarcomere length in humans.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/external-anal-sphincter-operates-short-sarcomere-length-humans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627387,"mean":4.9489064262842,"rank":2018339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":932505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627387,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2725296,"mean":5.2325922133225,"rank":1477725,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":738491,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2725296,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":411,"mean":2.6833853658537,"rank":175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":411,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":341,"mean":2.8864352941176,"rank":149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":341,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
