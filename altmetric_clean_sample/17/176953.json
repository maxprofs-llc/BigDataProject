According to 16S rRNA analysis, Chloroflexi species are the earliest branching bacteria capable of photosynthesis, and Cfl. aurantiacus has been long regarded as a key organism to resolve the obscurity of the origin and early evolution of photosynthesis. Cfl. aurantiacus contains a chimeric photosystem that comprises some characters of green sulfur bacteria and purple photosynthetic bacteria, and also has some unique electron transport proteins compared to other photosynthetic bacteria.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Kuo-Hsiang Tang","Kuo-Hsiang Tang","Kerrie Barry","Olga Chertkov","Eileen Dalin","Cliff S Han","Loren J Hauser","Barbara M Honchak","Lauren E Karbach","Miriam L Land","Alla Lapidus","Frank W Larimer","Natalia Mikhailova","Samuel Pitluck","Beverly K Pierson","Robert E Blankenship"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-12-334","issns":["1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1309629214,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/12\/334\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-12-334.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3150298","pmid":"21714912","pubdate":"2011-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"334","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Complete genome sequence of the filamentous anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-genome-sequence-filamentous-anoxygenic-phototrophic-bacterium-chloroflexus-aurantiacus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":1994485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2418321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3441619,"mean":5.748807719747,"rank":1560734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":1810789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3441619,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4113,"mean":3.3100515564202,"rank":1885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4113,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3895,"mean":3.3288402670776,"rank":1738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1956,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3895,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":25,"Student  > Ph.
