This study was designed to investigate such factors in sexually experienced Indian women. We used data from the National Family Health Survey 3 (NFHS-3), which tested 52,853 women for HIV, including 27,556 husband and wife pairs. Significant risk factors for all women and married women only were: aged 26-35 years (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] = 3.65 and 2.53, respectively), being poor (AORs = 1.57 and 1.79), having had a genital sore in the last 12 months (AORs = 3.16 and 3.01) and having more than one sexual partner (AORs = 5.95 and 5.15). For husband and wife pairs, suffering sexual violence (AOR = 2.63), husband having other wife\/wives (AOR = 3.40) and husband's education being secondary level or higher (AOR = 0.43) were significant. Intervention strategies in India should target young married (aged 25-35 years) and formerly married urban women who are poor, as well as those who have suffered sexual violence from their husbands, and\/or are (or whose husbands are) multi-partnered. Empowerment of women is fundamental to HIV\/AIDS prevention in India.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006615","authors":["P Ghosh","O A Arah","A Talukdar","D Sur","G R Babu","P Sengupta","R Detels"],"doi":"10.1258\/ijsa.2010.010127","issns":["0956-4624"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of STD & AIDS","last_mentioned_on":1308999608,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3095434\/?tool=pmcentrez"],"pmcid":"PMC3095434","pmid":"21464450","pubdate":"2011-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"NIH Public Access","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"140","subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Factors associated with HIV infection among Indian women","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factors-associated-hiv-infection-among-indian-women-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627649,"mean":4.9475528391989,"rank":2905834,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627649,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726109,"mean":5.2319492514628,"rank":2156121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":54707,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726109,"percentile":2},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":593,"mean":1.9252297297297,"rank":427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":593,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":403,"mean":2.0842935323383,"rank":319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":403,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
