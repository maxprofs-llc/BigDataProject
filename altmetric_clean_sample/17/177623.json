Four hundred and fifteen homeless adults participating in a nurse case managed intervention were included in this analysis. Logistic regression results indicated that those who reported a physical health limitation, multiple sex partners, daily drug use, alcohol dependence, or not having completed high school, were more likely to screen positive. Social support from non-drug users was protective. Given the importance of adherence to TB treatment regimens, the high prevalence of a positive screening for depressive symptoms in the homeless and the potential for depression to reduce adherence rates, routine screening and treatment for depression in high risk homeless adults being treated for TB may be warranted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c9f","authors":["Jill Berg","Adeline Nyamathi","Ashley Christiani","Donald Morisky","Barbara Leake","Berg, Jill","Nyamathi, Adeline","Christiani, Ashley","Morisky, Donald","Leake, Barbara"],"doi":"10.1002\/nur.20074","issns":["0160-6891","1098-240X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Research in nursing & health (Online)","last_mentioned_on":1452643200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3109748\/?tool=pmcentrez","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/nur.20074"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/nur.20074\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC3109748","pmid":"15884031","pubdate":"2005-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"NIH Public Access","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"220","subjects":["nursing","healthservicesresearch"],"title":"Predictors of Screening Results for Depressive Symptoms Among Homeless Adults in Los Angeles With Latent Tuberculosis","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predictors-screening-results-depressive-symptoms-among-homeless-adults-los-angeles-latent-tuberculos"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7779875,"mean":6.6346658333997,"rank":1587892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6180276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7779875,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7155471,"mean":6.9521928211513,"rank":1513476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5630443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7155471,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":380,"mean":3.2079683377309,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":380,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":374,"mean":3.2595710455764,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":374,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
