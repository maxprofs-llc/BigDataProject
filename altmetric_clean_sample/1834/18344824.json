We presented a 50-year-old woman with recurrent diarrhea and severe weight loss that developed a posterior cord syndrome. Endoscopy found a duodenal villous blunting, intraepithelial lymphocytosis, and lack of plasma cells and magnetic resonance imaging of the spine was normal. Laboratory assays confirmed common variable immunodeficiency syndrome and showed low levels of trace elements (copper and zinc). Treatment was initiated with parenteral replacement of trace elements and intravenous human immunoglobulin and the patient improved clinically. In conclusion, physicians must be aware that gastrointestinal and neurologic disorders may be related to each other and remember to request trace elements laboratory assessment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5203cf058f610003a3e","authors":["Yuri Silva Macedo","Ananda dos Santos Mota","Priscila Morais Monteiro","Angela Cristina Gouv\u00eaa Carvalho","Barbara Fernandes Diniz","Pedro Gemal Lanzieri","Ricardo Carneiro Ramos","Luis Otavio Mocarzel","Ronaldo Altenburg Gismondi"],"doi":"10.1155\/2017\/9870305","first_seen_on":"2017-03-31T10:49:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1687-9627","1687-9635"],"journal":"Case Reports in Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1490957104,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28356913?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5357530","pmid":"28356913","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Posterior Cord Syndrome and Trace Elements Deficiency as an Uncommon Presentation of Common Variable Immunodeficiency","type":"article","volume":"2017","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/posterior-cord-syndrome-trace-elements-deficiency-uncommon-presentation-common-variable-immunodefici"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":7292976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249551,"mean":13.214428218793,"rank":206486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249551,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":490,"mean":2.618163599182,"rank":315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":490,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":3.355,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ImmunePC_Papers\/statuses\/847761658931855362","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18344824],"posted_on":"2017-03-31T10:45:04+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunePCPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/686611418108407809\/IkK2E3oo_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot #PC papers #PubMed RSS | \u22652016 | #PlasmaCells are specialized #Bcells that secrete #antibody | Curated @mmw_lmw","id_on_source":"ImmunePC_Papers","tweeter_id":"4735354746","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":52},"tweet_id":"847761658931855362"}]}}
