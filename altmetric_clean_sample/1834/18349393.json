This process has been shown to be viable at a large scale and involves growing large quantities of wild-type plants and infiltrating the leaf tissue with a suspension of Agrobacterium tumefaciens bearing the genes of interest. This study examined one of the steps in this process that had not yet been optimized: the scale-up of Agrobacterium production to sufficient volumes for large-scale plant infiltration. Production of Agrobacterium strain C58C1 pTFS40 was scaled up from shake flasks (50-100\u00a0mL) to benchtop (5\u00a0L) scale with three types of media: Lysogeny broth (LB), yeast extract peptone (YEP) media, and a sucrose-based defined media. The maximum specific growth rate (\u03bc max) of the strain in the three types of media was 0.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0h(-1) in LB media, 0.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0h(-1) in YEP media, and 0.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0h(-1) in defined media. The maximum biomass concentration reached at this scale was 2.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1, 2.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1, and 2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0g dry cell weight (DCW)\/L for the three media types. Production was successfully scaled up to a 100-L working volume reactor with YEP media, using k L a as the scale-up parameter.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022dc","authors":["Leth, Ingrid K.","McDonald, Karen A.","Ingrid K.
