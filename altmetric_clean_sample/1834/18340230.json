This is another field that is closely connected with life science and medicine. In this work, a stable and luminescent phosphonate Ln-MOFs MIL-91(Al:Eu) and its derivatives composite Cu(2+)@MIL-91(Al:Eu) were synthesized. The rebound of luminescence of Cu(2+)@MIL-91(Al:Eu) that origin of Eu(3+) is observed in the presence of uric acid. This On-Off-On pattern is utilized for detecting uric acid, which is the final metabolite of purine. The composite reveals excellent selectivity and sensitivity for sensing uric acid. The detection of uric acid in real urine is also investigated. The effective detection of uric acid and tentative diagnosis of hyperuricuria on the basis of test paper is demonstrated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Xiao Lian","Bing Yan"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b03009","first_seen_on":"2017-03-31T08:31:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1497899435,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b03009"],"pmid":"28358494","pubdate":"2017-03-31T22:01:46+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Phosphonate MOFs Composite as Off\u2013On Fluorescent Sensor for Detecting Purine Metabolite Uric Acid and Diagnosing Hyperuricuria","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phosphonate-mofs-composite-offon-fluorescent-sensor-detecting-purine-metabolite-uric-acid-diagnosing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":2.6,"6m":2.6,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":3403400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4962778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248299,"mean":13.203065848295,"rank":93732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":153151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248299,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9267,"mean":1.1422898769696,"rank":1050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9267,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":357,"mean":1.5379213483146,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":357,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2,"Chemical Engineering":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Crystals_MDPI\/statuses\/847727882495336448","license":"gnip","rt":["MOF_papers"],"citation_ids":[18340230],"posted_on":"2017-03-31T08:30:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Crystals Open Access","url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/journal\/crystals","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/808892209407803392\/Yukx4dqV_normal.jpg","description":"Open Access journal published by MDPI, crystal structure, crystal growth techniques, and \ncharacterization techniques","id_on_source":"Crystals_MDPI","tweeter_id":"714367678043959296","geo":{"lt":47.41667,"ln":7.75,"country":"CH"},"followers":313},"tweet_id":"847727882495336448"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/WBTolman\/statuses\/876821194003140608","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18340230],"posted_on":"2017-06-19T15:17:17+00:00","author":{"name":"William Tolman","url":"http:\/\/www.chem.umn.edu\/groups\/tolman","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/832271105985372160\/lrRpmPma_normal.jpg","description":"Professor and Chair of Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota; Editor-in-Chief of Inorganic Chemistry; Dad; bicyclist; fan of Mpls","id_on_source":"WBTolman","tweeter_id":"28503759","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1948},"tweet_id":"876821194003140608"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/GroupHarding\/statuses\/876822724336689152","license":"gnip","rt":["WBTolman"],"citation_ids":[18340230],"posted_on":"2017-06-19T15:23:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Harding Group","url":"http:\/\/www.funtechwu.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/756280833447636992\/G4h1EeBs_normal.jpg","description":"Research group exploring inorganic, coordination and supramolecular chemistry.
