A completely randomized design was used with 2 lactating cows assigned to each of 10 dietary treatments, as follows: negative controls (no AFB1 or SC-based biomass), positive controls (AFB1 alone), DY alone, DY + AFB1, BY alone, BY + AFB1, CW alone, CW + AFB1, AY alone, and AY + AFB1. The cows in the aflatoxin treatment group received AFB1 from d 1 to 6, while the SC biomass was administered with the AFB1 bolus from d 4 to 6. Aflatoxin B1 or SC-based products did not affect milk production or milk composition during the experimental period. Aflatoxin M1 was detected in the milk from all aflatoxin treatment group cows, reaching maximum levels at d 3 and varying from 0.52 \u00b1 0.03 to 1.00 \u00b1 0.04 \u00b5g\/L. At end of the treatment period, CW, AY, DY, and BY removed 78%, 89%, 45%, and 50% of AFM1 from the milk, respectively, based on the highest level found on d 3. Results indicate a potential application of industrial fermentation by-products, especially CW and AY, as a feed additive in the diets of dairy cows to reduce the excretion of AFM1 in milk.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d4a","authors":["Gon\u00e7alves, B L","Gon\u00e7alves, J L","Rosim, R E","Cappato, L P","Cruz, A G","Oliveira, C A F","Corassin, C H","B.L.
