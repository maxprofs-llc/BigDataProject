The distribution within exposed beehives of pesticides commonly used in soybean plantation, was assessed. Residue levels of insecticides in soybean leaves, honey bees, wax, honey and pollen were analyzed. The transference from pesticides present in the environment into the beehive was evidenced. The obtained results allow relating pesticide concentrations present in the environment with traces found in foraging bees. Therefore, pesticide transference ratios could be calculated for each detected compound (acetamiprid, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) which showed a linear inverse trend with their 1-octanol\/water partition coefficient (Kow). The least transferred pesticide to the hive (acetamiprid) has the highest vapor pressure (Vp). This study gives new insights on the usefulness of monitoring the environment through beehives aiming to evaluate if agroecosystems remain sustainable. It also contributes to generate valuable information for model building aiming to predict environmental quality through beehive's analysis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034e7","authors":["Niell Silvina","Jes\u00fas Florencia","P\u00e9rez Nicol\u00e1s","P\u00e9rez Cecilia","Pareja Luc\u00eda","Silvana Abbate","Carrasco-Letelier Leonidas","D\u00edaz Sebasti\u00e1n","Mendoza Yamand\u00fa","Cesio Ver\u00f3nica","Heinzen Horacio"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2017.01.011","first_seen_on":"2017-05-03T20:02:54+00:00","issns":["00489697"],"journal":"Science of the Total Environment","last_mentioned_on":1493841760,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0048969717300116"],"pmid":"28073057","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Neonicotinoids transference from the field to the hive by honey bees: Towards a pesticide residues biomonitor","type":"article","volume":"581-582","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neonicotinoids-transference-field-hive-honey-bees-towards-pesticide-residues-biomonitor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150286,"mean":6.9044882123689,"rank":4317476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2262569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150286,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235605,"mean":12.568278416325,"rank":130932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":83011,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235605,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5206,"mean":5.0219527377522,"rank":3414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5206,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":5.5489552238806,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
