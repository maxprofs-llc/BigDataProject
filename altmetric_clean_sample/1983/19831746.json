Our latest paper","Desarrollando la conciencia sobre sostenibilidad en enfermer\u00eda mediante una aproximaci\u00f3n basada en escenarios"],"citation":{"abstract":"The delivery of healthcare has an impact on the environment and contributes to climate change. As a consequence, the way in which nurses and midwives use and dispose of natural resources in clinical practice, and the subsequent impact on the environment, should be integral component of nursing and midwifery education. Opportunities need to be found to embed such issues into nursing curricula; thus bringing sustainability issues 'closer to home' and making them more relevant for clinical practice.\nThe study was designed to measure the impact of a sustainability-focussed, scenario-based learning educational intervention on the attitudes and knowledge of student nurses and midwives.\nPre test\/Post test intervention study using scenario-based learning as the educational intervention. The Sustainability Attitudes in Nursing Survey (SANS_2) was used as the outcome measure.\nClinical skills session in a UK University School of Nursing and Midwifery.\n676 second year undergraduate nursing and midwifery students.\nThe 7-point scale SANS survey was completed before and after the teaching session; standard non-parametric analysis compared pre and post intervention scores.\nChanges were observed in attitude towards climate change and sustainability and to the inclusion of these topics within the nursing curricula (p=0.000). Participants demonstrated greater knowledge of natural resource use and the cost of waste disposal following the session (p=0.000). Participants also reported that sessions were realistic, and levels of agreement with statements supporting the value of the session and the interactive nature of delivery were higher following the session.\nUsing a scenario-based learning approach with nursing and midwifery students can change attitudes and knowledge towards sustainability and climate change. Embedding this approach in the context of clinical skills provides a novel and engaging approach that is both educationally sound and clinically relevant.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b83","authors":["Janet Richardson","Jane Grose","Martyn Bradbury","Janet Kelsey"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nedt.2017.04.022","first_seen_on":"2017-05-03T17:32:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["02606917","1532-2793"],"journal":"Nurse Education Today","last_mentioned_on":1499713493,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0260691717300989","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.nedt.2017.04.022","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0260691717300989?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email","http:\/\/www.nurseeducationtoday.com\/article\/S0260-6917(17)30098-9\/fulltext?platform=hootsuite"],"pmid":"28477563","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","education"],"title":"Developing awareness of sustainability in nursing and midwifery using a scenario-based approach: evidence from a pre and post educational intervention study","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/developing-awareness-sustainability-nursing-midwifery-using-scenariobased-approach-evidence-pre-post"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.1,"score_history":{"1y":5.1,"6m":5.1,"3m":2.6,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187776,"mean":6.9233436649085,"rank":1550965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6631230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187776,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237368,"mean":12.597261936158,"rank":60071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":177025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237368,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":952,"mean":4.8821366982124,"rank":217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":952,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":12.575581395349,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
