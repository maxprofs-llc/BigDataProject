We propose a solver that iteratively updates the solution in the discrete domain by linear assignment approximation. The proposed method is guaranteed to converge to a stationary discrete solution and avoids the annealing procedure and ad-hoc post binarization step that are required in several previous methods. Specifically, we start with a simple iterative discrete gradient assignment solver. This solver can be trapped in an m-circle sequence under moderate conditions, where m is the order of the graph matching problem. We then devise an adaptive relaxation mechanism to jump out this degenerating case and show that the resulting new path will converge to a fixed solution in the discrete domain. The proposed method is tested on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. The experimental results corroborate the efficacy of our method.","altmetric_jid":"56b89c912a83ee67498b4588","authors":["Junchi Yan","Changsheng Li","Yin Li","Guitao Cao"],"doi":"10.1109\/tcyb.2017.2655538","first_seen_on":"2017-03-30T01:35:53+00:00","issns":["2168-2267","2168-2275"],"journal":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","last_mentioned_on":1490836602,"links":["http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/abstract\/document\/7858754\/?reload=true"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/iel7\/6221036\/6352949\/07858754.pdf","pmid":"28222006","pubdate":"2017-02-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IEEE","title":"Adaptive Discrete Hypergraph Matching","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/document\/7858754\/","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adaptive-discrete-hypergraph-matching"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":7289330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249269,"mean":13.229674157934,"rank":206238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249269,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":4.6604225352113,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.07,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
