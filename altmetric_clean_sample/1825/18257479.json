This observational, retrospective study was requested by the European Medicines Agency to investigate dexmedetomidine use in clinical practice, with particular focus on off-label use including the paediatric population.\nStudy countries and sites were chosen from those with highest dexmedetomidine use, based on sales. Site selection (blind) was conducted by a multi-specialist, independent group. Anonymised data on demographics, treatment indication, dexmedetomidine dosing, concomitant medications and treatment effectiveness were collected retrospectively from records of all dexmedetomidine-treated patients at the site during the enrolment period. Informed consent was waived to avoid influencing the prescribing of dexmedetomidine. Recruitment was completed within 18\u2009months of first site initiation.\nData from 2000 patients were collected from 16 hospitals in 4 EU countries (Finland 750, Poland 505, Germany 470, Austria 275). Median age was 62\u2009years, with more males (70.2%) than females. Dexmedetomidine was primarily used in adult ICU (86.0%) for ICU sedation (78.6%) and mostly dosed according the product label. The intended sedative effect was obtained in 84.9% of administrations. Paediatric use (5.9% patients, mostly Austria and Finland) occurred mainly in adult or paediatric ICU (75.6%) for sedation (67.2%).\nOverall, most patients were treated with dexmedetomidine according to the product labelling. Use in children was limited but significant and similar in scope to that in adults. Administrations not fully according to the product labelling normally occurred in an ICU environment and reflected extensively investigated clinical uses of dexmedetomidine.
