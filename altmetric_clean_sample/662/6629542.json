Twenty to 40\u00a0% with localized disease at diagnosis eventually develop metastases. Complete metastasectomy confers five year survival rate of 35\u00a0% to 50\u00a0%. Traditional thoracic approach for lung metastasectomy carries increased morbidity. We report a less morbid trans-diaphragmatic approach. Right cytoreductive nephrectomy with liver and simultaneous trans-diaphragmatic lung resection was performed with uneventful perioperative course in a 60\u00a0year male with metastatic RCC. Trans-diaphragmatic resection of peripheral lung metastasis can be considered electively approach in selective cases of RCC with ipsilateral resectable inferior lung metastases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f61000775b","authors":["Varun, Mittal","Anil, Mandhani","Majumdar, Gauranga"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13193-015-0471-3","endpage":"100","first_seen_on":"2016-04-12T15:22:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0975-7651","0976-6952"],"issue":"1","journal":"Indian Journal of Surgical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1460474292,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27065692?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27065692","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgical Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"startpage":"98","title":"Simultaneous Trans-Diaphragmatic Approach for Wedge Resection of the Solitary Ipsilateral Lung Metastasis in Renal Cell Carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simultaneous-transdiaphragmatic-approach-wedge-resection-solitary-ipsilateral-lung-metastasis-renal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7540906,"mean":6.5135694142772,"rank":6531904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7540906,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271087,"mean":11.328104180961,"rank":228599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271087,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":1.1166666666667,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.6875,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/719907476192174080","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6629542],"posted_on":"2016-04-12T15:18:12+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":383},"tweet_id":"719907476192174080"}]}}
