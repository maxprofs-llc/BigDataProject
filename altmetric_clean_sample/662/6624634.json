The etiology of chronic low back pain is, in most of the cases (up to 85%), unknown or nonspecific, while the specific causes (specific spinal pathology and neuropathic\/radicular disorders) are uncommon. Central sensitization has been recently recognized as a potential pathophysiological mechanism underlying a group of chronic pain conditions, and may be a contributory factor for a sub-group of patients with chronic low back pain. The purposes of this narrative review are twofold. First, to describe central sensitization and its symptoms and signs in patients with chronic pain disorders in order to allow its recognition in patients with nonspecific low back pain. Second, to provide general treatment principles of chronic low back pain with particular emphasis on pharmacotherapy targeting central sensitization.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cb9","authors":["Sanzarello, Ilaria","Merlini, Luciano","Rosa, Michele Attilio","Perrone, Mariada","Frugiuele, Jacopo","Borghi, Raffaele","Faldini, Cesare","Ilaria Sanzarello","Luciano Merlini","Michele Attilio Rosa","Mariada Perrone","Jacopo Frugiuele","Raffaele Borghi","Cesare Faldini"],"doi":"10.3233\/bmr-160685","first_seen_on":"2016-04-12T10:35:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-6324","10538127","18786324"],"journal":"Journal of Back & Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1506945602,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27062464?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27062464","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27062464"],"pmid":"27062464","pubdate":"2016-04-12T22:01:51+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine","physiology"],"title":"Central sensitization in chronic low back pain: A narrative review.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/central-sensitization-chronic-low-back-pain-narrative-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.33,"score_history":{"1y":16.08,"6m":16.08,"3m":16.08,"1m":8,"1w":8,"6d":8,"5d":8,"4d":8,"3d":8,"2d":8,"1d":8,"at":16.33},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8459439,"mean":7.105544277756,"rank":544773,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7914534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8459439,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277876,"mean":11.576488874494,"rank":26940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":250924,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277876,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283,"mean":3.9206666666667,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":3.6214285714286,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
