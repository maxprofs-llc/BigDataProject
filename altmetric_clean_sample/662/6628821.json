Analyzed data comprised vessel characteristics, landings, fishing areas and trawling duration of 10,144 fishing operations monitored in Santa Catarina State from 2003 to 2011. Three main fishing strategies were differentiated: 'shrimp trawling', 'slope trawling' and 'pair trawling'. Jointly these operations burned over 141.5millionl of diesel to land 342.3millionkg of fish and shellfish. Annually, 0.36-0.48l were consumed for every kg of catch landed. Because all fishing strategies relied on multispecific catches to raise total incomes, estimates of fuel use intensity were generally low but increased 316-1025% if only nominal targets were considered. In nine years, trawling operations emitted 104.07GgC to the atmosphere, between 36,800-49,500tons CO2 per year.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006690","authors":["Dagoberto Port","Jose Angel Alvarez Perez","Jo\u00e3o Thadeu de Menezes"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.marpolbul.2016.03.062","first_seen_on":"2016-04-12T14:35:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0025326X","1879-3363"],"journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1460222179,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0025326X1630193X&_version=1&md5=d71c147fc18042c6fcb626f54170ebcd"],"pmid":"27068561","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Earth and Planetary Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Energy direct inputs and greenhouse gas emissions of the main industrial trawl fishery of Brazil","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/energy-direct-inputs-greenhouse-gas-emissions-main-industrial-trawl-fishery-brazil"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7523579,"mean":6.5040957411445,"rank":6517099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7523579,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270882,"mean":11.324021987515,"rank":228379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270882,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2593,"mean":5.0907060185185,"rank":1904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2593,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175,"mean":3.1815747126437,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":5,"Lecturer":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":4},"by_discipline":{"Design":1,"Engineering":5,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":2,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Mathematics":1,"Unspecified":1,"Environmental Science":7,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BR":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ecotoxicology\/statuses\/718850038806507520","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6628821],"posted_on":"2016-04-09T17:16:19+00:00","author":{"name":"ecotoxicology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/499652563751280642\/9Yw-u5dW_normal.png","description":"Ecotoxicology and Environmental Pollution  Publications Feed.
