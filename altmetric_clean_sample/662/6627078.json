There are few reports in the literature regarding the presence of CO-induced cardiomyopathy from early stages in the emergency department (ED). We prospectively investigated the early incidence of CO-induced cardiomyopathy and its patterns in patients with cardiomyopathy.\nDuring a 10-month period, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed in 43 consecutive patients with CO poisoning and myocardial injury, which was defined as elevated high-sensitive troponin I within 24\u2009h after ED arrival. Measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction and wall motion abnormalities were performed to evaluate cardiac function. If a patient had CO-induced cardiomyopathy, we measured cardiac function at the time of patient admission, day 1, day 2, and once within seven days of hospitalization.\nThe incidence of cardiomyopathy was as high as 74.4% (32 of 43 patients) in CO-poisoned patients with myocardial injury based on initial ED results. Echocardiographic patterns included non-cardiomyopathy (25.6%), global dysfunction (51.2%), and Takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy (23.2%). Patients in the global dysfunction group had significantly more normalized cardiac dysfunction within 72\u2009h than did those in the Takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy group (81.8% vs. 22.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.001).\nPatients with CO poisoning and myocardial injury experienced cardiomyopathy, including reversible global dysfunction and a Takotsubo-like pattern. Investigation of cardiomyopathy needs to be considered in patients with CO poisoning and myocardial injury.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5213cf058f610003aa4","authors":["Cha, Yong Sung","Kim, Hyun","Hwang, Sung Oh","Kim, Jang Young","Kim, Yun Kwon","Choi, Eun Hee","Kim, Oh Hyun","Kim, Hyung Il","Cha, Kyoung Chul","Lee, Kang Hyun","Yong Sung Cha"],"doi":"10.3109\/15563650.2016.1162310","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2016-04-12T12:52:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1556-9519","1556-3650"],"journal":"Clinical Toxicology (15563650)","last_mentioned_on":1496798300,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27064298?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/15563650.2016.1162310","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27064298"],"pmid":"27064298","pubdate":"2016-04-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","title":"Incidence and patterns of cardiomyopathy in carbon monoxide-poisoned patients with myocardial injury","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/incidence-patterns-cardiomyopathy-carbon-monoxidepoisoned-patients-myocardial-injury"},"altmetric_score":{"score":32.05,"score_history":{"1y":15.4,"6m":1.35,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":32.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":282007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":8049026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277192,"mean":11.537079392909,"rank":16129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":261051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277192,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1084,"mean":8.9565226223453,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":1035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1084,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":15.657878787879,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":22,"researcher":1,"practitioner":12,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":13,"Members of the public":22,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Other":3,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":7,"GB":10,"EG":1,"QA":1,"SA":1,"MY":3,"AU":3,"CA":1,"IE":1},"mendeley":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/emclerkship2\/statuses\/790396430468931584","license":"gnip","rt":["ToxTalks"],"citation_ids":[6627078],"posted_on":"2016-10-24T03:36:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Phill Aguet","url":"http:\/\/emclerkship.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/789431859944034304\/s_wiiP_P_normal.jpg","description":"Emergency Medicine nerd.
