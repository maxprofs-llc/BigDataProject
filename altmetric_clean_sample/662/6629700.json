Studies show improvement in motor function and sensory processing for patients with a variety of neuromuscular disabilities, developmental disorders, or skeletal impairments as a result of using hippotherapy.\nThe primary objective of this study is to identify the pervasiveness of hippotherapy in Southern California, and any factors that impair its utilization.\nOne hundred and fifty-two rehabilitation centers in the Southern California counties of Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Kern County were identified, and surveyed to ascertain if hippotherapy is utilized, and if not, why not.\nThrough a review of forty facilities that responded to our inquiry, our study indicates that the majority of rehabilitation centers are familiar with hippotherapy, however, only seven have reported that hippotherapy is indeed available as an option in therapy at their centers.\nIt is concluded that hippotherapy, used in a broad based array of physical and sensory disorders, is limited in its ability to be utilized, primarily due to remuneration issues.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a9","authors":["Pham, Christine","Bitonte, Robert"],"doi":"10.3233\/nre-161332","first_seen_on":"2016-04-12T15:30:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-6448"],"journal":"NeuroRehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1460474950,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27061169?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27061169","pubdate":"2016-04-12T22:02:26+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine","neurology"],"title":"Hippotherapy: Remuneration issues impair the offering of this therapeutic strategy at Southern California rehabilitation centers.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hippotherapy-remuneration-issues-impair-offering-therapeutic-strategy-southern-california-rehabilita"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7540906,"mean":6.5135694142772,"rank":6531904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7540906,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271087,"mean":11.328106025394,"rank":228599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271087,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":395,"mean":3.5327918781726,"rank":289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":395,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":3.1929,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/719910235943534593","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6629700],"posted_on":"2016-04-12T15:29:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":964},"tweet_id":"719910235943534593"}]}}
