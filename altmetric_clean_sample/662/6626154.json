We previously showed attenuating effects on inflammation, thrombogenicity and haemodynamics by inhibiting the Toll-like receptor co-factor CD14 and complement factor C5 in a porcine Escherichia coli-induced sepsis model. The present study explored the effect on organ inflammation in these pigs. Tissue samples were examined from the combined treatment group (n=8), the positive (n=8) and negative (n=6) control groups after 4h of sepsis. Inflammatory biomarkers were measured using ELISA, multiplex and qPCR analysis. Combined inhibition of C5 and CD14 markedly attenuated IL-1\u03b2 by 31-66% (P<0.05) and IL-6 by 54-96% (P<0.01) in liver, kidney, lung and spleen; IL-8 by 65-100% in kidney, lung, spleen, and heart (P<0.05) and MCP-1 by 46-69% in liver, kidney, spleen and heart (P<0.05). Combined inhibition significantly attenuated tissue factor mRNA upregulation in spleen (P<0.05) and IP-10 mRNA upregulation in four out of five organs. Finally, C5aR mRNA downregulation was prevented in heart and kidney (P<0.05). Combined inhibition of C5 and CD14 thus markedly attenuated inflammatory responses in all organs examined. The anti-inflammatory effects observed in lung and heart may explain the delayed haemodynamic disturbances observed in septic pigs receiving combined inhibition of C5 and CD14.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a96","authors":["Egge, Kjetil H","Thorgersen, Ebbe B","Pischke, S\u00f8ren E","Lindstad, Julie K","Pharo, Anne","Bongoni, Anjan K","Rieben, Robert","Nunn, Miles A","Barratt-Due, Andreas","Mollnes, Tom E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.imbio.2015.04.002","endpage":"1005","first_seen_on":"2016-04-12T11:28:31+00:00","issns":["1878-3279","01712985"],"issue":"8","journal":"Immunobiology","last_mentioned_on":1460466727,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25956456?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25956456","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"999","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Organ inflammation in porcine Escherichia coli sepsis is markedly attenuated by combined inhibition of C5 and CD14","type":"article","volume":"220","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/organ-inflammation-porcine-escherichia-coli-sepsis-markedly-attenuated-combined-inhibition-c5-cd14"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7540906,"mean":6.5135694142772,"rank":5707964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1009060,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7540906,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271088,"mean":11.328071062057,"rank":190321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271088,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":503,"mean":2.1931235059761,"rank":293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":503,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.3447368421053,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"NO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/719849598466924545","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6626154],"posted_on":"2016-04-12T11:28:13+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"719849598466924545"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/statuses\/719875746307506176","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6626154],"posted_on":"2016-04-12T13:12:07+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
