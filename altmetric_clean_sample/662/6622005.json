Aging-associated soft tissue atrophy and loss of skin elasticity can lead to periorbital volume loss and subsequent development of multiple eyelid folds in patients previously with a native single-fold. The authors describe a nonsurgical technique for the management of multiple eyelid folds in Asian patients using hyaluronic acid gel (HAG) injection.\nIn this retrospective review, 6 upper eyelids of 5 Asian patients who underwent HAG injection for multiple eyelid folds were identified. Patients were injected with HAG superior to the native eyelid fold in a superficial plane just deep to the orbicularis oculi muscle and in the suborbicularis oculi plane of the superior sulcus.\nFive Asian patients with prior history of a single naturally occurring upper eyelid fold who developed age-related unilateral multiple eyelid folds underwent injection with HAG. All patients tolerated the procedure well and without complication. Restoration of a single-fold with bilateral upper eyelid symmetry was achieved successfully in all patients.\nMultiple eyelid folds may occur in Asian patients with an established naturally occurring single eyelid fold as a result of periorbital volume loss. HAG injection in the periorbital region provides a nonsurgical solution to restore volume and reform a single eyelid fold.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f6100083ca","authors":["Tamboli, Diana","Mancini, Ronald"],"doi":"10.1097\/iop.0000000000000696","endpage":"312","first_seen_on":"2016-04-12T06:09:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0740-9303","1537-2677"],"issue":"4","journal":"Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1474318508,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/op-rs\/9000\/00000\/Hyaluronic_Acid_Gel_Injection_for_Multiple_Eyelid.98827.pdf?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/op-rs\/Abstract\/2016\/07000\/Hyaluronic_Acid_Gel_Injection_for_Multiple_Eyelid.15.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/op-rs\/Pages\/articleviewer.aspx?year=2016&issue=07000&article=00015&type=Fulltext&cid=MR-eJP-HotTopics-PlasticSurgery-PlasticSurgery-JOP-NoPromo&rid=128788144","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/op-rs\/Pages\/articleviewer.aspx?year=2016&issue=07000&article=00015&type=Fulltext&rid=128788144"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/op-rs\/9000\/00000\/Hyaluronic_Acid_Gel_Injection_for_Multiple_Eyelid.98827.pdf","pmid":"27065431","pubdate":"2016-04-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"310","subjects":["generalsurgery","ophthalmology"],"title":"Hyaluronic Acid Gel Injection for Multiple Eyelid Folds in Asian Eyelids:  A Novel Approach.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/op-rs\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Hyaluronic_Acid_Gel_Injection_for_Multiple_Eyelid.98827.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hyaluronic-acid-gel-injection-multiple-eyelid-folds-asian-eyelids"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":1178072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":7223231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277564,"mean":11.55990000108,"rank":54959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":222464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277564,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":648,"mean":1.1111313755796,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":648,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":0.89714285714286,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":1,"practitioner":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":6,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
