Studies were also conducted to find out the antibiotic resistance in Salmonella isolates.\nA total of 400 samples comprising of 200 chevon meat and 200 chicken meat samples were processed for isolation of Salmonella and all isolates were further confirmed on the basis of cultural and biochemical characters and by targeting invA gene of Salmonella. All Salmonella isolates were also examined for their antimicrobial drug susceptibility\/resistance pattern against commonly used antibiotics.\nOut of 400 samples, the prevalence of Salmonella in chevon and chicken meat was found 9% and 7% respectively, with an overall prevalence of 8%. Polymerase chain reaction targeting invA gene of Salmonella showed positive result with 31 isolates. All 32 Salmonella isolates were found to be highly sensitive to ciprofloxacin while 96.87%, 96.87% and 93.75% were sensitive to gentamicin, imipenem, and ceftazidime, respectively. 93.75% and 59.37% isolates were resistant to erythromycin and oxytetracycline, respectively. Out of 32, 14 isolates had multiple antibiotic resistance index equal to or more than 0.2.\nSalmonella in chevon and chicken meat samples is prevailing in the areas of sampling due to poor hygienic conditions and also demonstrated the varied spectrum of antimicrobial resistance, including several multiple drug resistance phenotypes. Therefore, the present study emphasizes the need for continued surveillance of zoonotic foodborne pathogens including antimicrobial-resistant variants throughout the food production chain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53b3cf058f6100046f9","authors":["Naik, V K","Shakya, S","Patyal, A","Gade, N E","Bhoomika, "],"doi":"10.14202\/vetworld.2015.702-706","endpage":"706","first_seen_on":"2016-04-12T10:35:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0972-8988","09728988","22310916"],"issue":"6","journal":"Veterinary World","last_mentioned_on":1460465164,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27065633?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27065633?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27065633","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"702","title":"Isolation and molecular characterization of Salmonella spp. from chevon and chicken meat collected from different districts of Chhattisgarh, India","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isolation-molecular-characterization-salmonella-spp-chevon-chicken-meat-collected-different-district"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7540906,"mean":6.5135694142772,"rank":3677106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3673167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7540906,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271088,"mean":11.328076595336,"rank":135825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":124895,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271088,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":0.93832,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.3608333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
