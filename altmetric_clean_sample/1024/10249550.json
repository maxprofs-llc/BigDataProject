Records of U.S. military members in mobilization camps (n = 40), military academies, and officer training schools were examined to document differences in influenza experiences during the fall 1918. During the fall-winter 1918-1919, mortality percentages were higher among soldiers in U.S. Army mobilization camps (0.34-4.3%) than among officer trainees (0-1.0%). Susceptibility to infection and clinical expressions of 1918 pandemic influenza varied largely based on host epidemiological characteristics rather than the inherent virulence of the virus.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5053cf058f6100030df","authors":["Shanks, G Dennis","Burroughs, Steven","Sohn, Joshua D","Waters, Norman C","Smith, Virginia F","Waller, Michael","Brundage, John F"],"doi":"10.7205\/milmed-d-15-00124","endpage":"882","first_seen_on":"2016-08-03T17:35:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1930-613X","0026-4075"],"issue":"8","journal":"Military Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1470253113,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27483527?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27483527?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27483527?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"27483527","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"878","subjects":["militarymedicine"],"title":"Variable Mortality From the 1918\u20131919 Influenza Pandemic During Military Training","type":"article","volume":"181","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/variable-mortality-19181919-influenza-pandemic-during-military-training"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":5907320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1963190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257660,"mean":11.998157021489,"rank":167611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":74826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257660,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":839,"mean":4.0616252983294,"rank":644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":839,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":6.2928571428571,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MalariaPapers\/statuses\/760891716002021376","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10249550],"posted_on":"2016-08-03T17:34:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Malaria Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/633328476070785024\/zGKHLt0g_normal.png","description":"I'm a bot tweeting papers about malaria as they appear on PubMed (& now preprints on BioRxiv). \n\nRun by @theosanderson.","id_on_source":"MalariaPapers","tweeter_id":"3428446343","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":136},"tweet_id":"760891716002021376"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/H7N9Influenza\/statuses\/760922741461495808","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10249550],"posted_on":"2016-08-03T19:38:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Novel Influenza News","url":"http:\/\/h7n9flunews.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3501363698\/67e86cb1c0a5dbe79300ad64694b8c9d_normal.jpeg","description":"Dave is a published writer and former magazine editor.
