Analysis was conducted by genotyping of three single-copy African swine fever (ASF) genes. The E183L and B646L genes that encode structural proteins p54 and p72, respectively, were utilized to delineate genotypes before intragenotypic resolution by characterization of the tetrameric amino acid repeat region within the hypervariable central variable region of the B602L gene. The results showed no variation in the p72 and p54 gene regions sequenced. Phylogeny of p72 sequences revealed that all the Nigerian isolates belonged to genotype I, while that of the p54 recovered the Ia genotype. Analysis of B602L gene revealed the differences in the number of tetrameric repeats. Four new variants (Tet-15, Tet-17a, Tet-17b and Tet-48) were recovered, while a fifth variant (Tet-20) was the most widely distributed in the country displacing Tet-36 reported previously in 2003-2006. The viruses responsible for ASF outbreaks in Nigeria are from very closely related but mutated variants of the virus that have been circulating since 1997. A practical implication of the genetic variability of the Nigerian viral isolates in this study is the need for continuous sampling and analysis of circulating viruses, which will provide epidemiological information on the evolution of ASFV in the field versus new incursion for informed strategic control of the disease in the country.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003688","authors":["Luka, P D","Achenbach, J E","Mwiine, F N","Lamien, C E","Shamaki, D","Unger, H","Erume, J","Luka, P.
