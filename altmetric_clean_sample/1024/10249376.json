In this study, we demonstrate a two-layer Ta\/TaO x \/TiO2\/Ti cross-point synaptic array that emulates the high-density three-dimensional network architecture of human brains. Excellent uniformity and reproducibility among intralayer and interlayer cells were realized. Moreover, at least 50 analog synaptic weight states could be precisely controlled with minimal drifting during a cycling endurance test of 5000 training pulses at an operating voltage of 3 V. We also propose a new state-independent bipolar-pulse-training scheme to improve the linearity of weight updates. The improved linearity considerably enhances the fault tolerance of HNNs, thus improving the training accuracy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003146","authors":["Wang, I-Ting","Chang, Chih-Cheng","Chiu, Li-Wen","Chou, Teyuh","Hou, Tuo-Hung"],"doi":"10.1088\/0957-4484\/27\/36\/365204","first_seen_on":"2016-08-03T17:29:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1361-6528","0957-4484"],"issue":"36","journal":"Nanotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1470476211,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27483492?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27483492","pubdate":"2016-09-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"365204","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"\n              3D Ta\/TaO\n              \n                x\n              \n              \/TiO\n              2\n              \/Ti synaptic array and linearity tuning of weight update for hardware neural network applications\n            ","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/3d-tatao-i-subxsub-i-tio-sub2sub-ti-synaptic-array-linearity-tuning-weight-update-hardware-neural-ne"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172683,"mean":6.9158600214652,"rank":4303279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3841554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172683,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257763,"mean":11.999218092659,"rank":140492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":116204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257763,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1595,"mean":6.0001455457967,"rank":819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1595,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":5.4024086021505,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
