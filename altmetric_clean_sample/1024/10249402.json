Although societies are of different faiths and belief systems, what they all share is spirituality.\nUpon this we put forward the hypothesis of changes in gene receptor expressions as a result of spiritual intervention for the first time in the world.\nIn this study, the spiritual intervention was conducted on 57 volunteer females with early breast cancer involvement. Blood samples were collected prior to and after the spiritual intervention to analyze the changes in dopamine gene receptor expressions as the main site of effect. In order to administer the spiritual intervention backed by Quran, Islam and international standards, issues, with emphasis on peace, human growth and perfection, accepting God as an eternal source of power and kindness to build trust and reduce stress, were selected. They included prayer, patience, reliance, self-sacrifice and forgiveness, altruism and kindness, remission and repentance, thankfulness, zikr (mantra), meditation, and death concept.\nObtained results from peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples analyzed by real time-PCR showed significant reduction in dopamine gene receptor (DRD1-5) expressions in comparison with those of pre-test scores and the control group.\nSpiritual intervention based on Islamic principals can bring back mental health, increase hope and quality of life and eventually change dopamine gene receptor expressions resulting in reduction of cell proliferation, thus better prevention and management in breast cancer patients compared to other forms of treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67c3cf058f6100097cf","authors":["Hosseini, Leili","Lotfi Kashani, Farah","Akbari, Somayeh","Akbari, Mohammad Esmaeil","Sarafraz Mehr, Saeedeh","Leili Hosseini","Farah Lotfi Kashani","Somayeh Akbari","Mohammad Esmaeil Akbari","Saeedeh Sarafraz Mehr"],"doi":"10.17795\/ijcp-6360","first_seen_on":"2016-08-03T17:30:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2008-2398","2008-2401"],"issue":"2","journal":"Iranian Journal of Cancer Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1470946386,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27482335?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4951763\/"],"pmcid":"PMC4951763","pmid":"27482335","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences","title":"The Islamic Perspective of Spiritual Intervention Effectiveness on Bio-Psychological Health Displayed by Gene Expression in Breast Cancer Patients","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/islamic-perspective-spiritual-intervention-effectiveness-biopsychological-health-displayed-gene-expr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200733,"mean":6.9347145888862,"rank":5935361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1973818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200733,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257991,"mean":12.000584386991,"rank":167475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":75231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257991,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.4068,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
