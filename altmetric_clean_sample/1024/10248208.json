In such situations, separation of the target speech signal in azimuth from the interfering masker signals can lead to an improvement in target intelligibility, an effect known as spatial release from masking (SRM). This study assessed the contributions of two stimulus properties that vary with separation of sound sources, binaural envelope (ENV) and temporal fine structure (TFS), to SRM in normal-hearing (NH) human listeners. Target speech was presented from the front and speech maskers were either colocated with or symmetrically separated from the target in azimuth. The target and maskers were presented either as natural speech or as \"noise-vocoded\" speech in which the intelligibility was conveyed only by the speech ENVs from several frequency bands; the speech TFS within each band was replaced with noise carriers. The experiments were designed to preserve the spatial cues in the speech ENVs while retaining\/eliminating them from the TFS. This was achieved by using the same\/different noise carriers in the two ears. A phenomenological auditory-nerve model was used to verify that the interaural correlations in TFS differed across conditions, whereas the ENVs retained a high degree of correlation, as intended. Overall, the results from this study revealed that binaural TFS cues, especially for frequency regions below 1500 Hz, are critical for achieving SRM in NH listeners. Potential implications for studying SRM in hearing-impaired listeners are discussed.\nAcoustic signals received by the auditory system pass first through an array of physiologically based band-pass filters. Conceptually, at the output of each filter, there are two principal forms of temporal information: slowly varying fluctuations in the envelope (ENV) and rapidly varying fluctuations in the temporal fine structure (TFS). The importance of these two types of information in everyday listening (e.g., conversing in a noisy social situation; the \"cocktail-party\" problem) has not been established. This study assessed the contributions of binaural ENV and TFS cues for understanding speech in multiple-talker situations. Results suggest that, whereas the ENV cues are important for speech intelligibility, binaural TFS cues are critical for perceptually segregating the different talkers and thus for solving the cocktail party problem.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Jayaganesh Swaminathan","Christine R.
