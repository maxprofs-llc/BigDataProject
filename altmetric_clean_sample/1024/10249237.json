Zurita Gavilanes L, et al. Reumatol Clin. 2016"],"citation":{"abstract":"Lupus nephritis (LN) is a common and severe complication in patients with lupus. Current therapy is based on immunosuppressive drugs and glucocorticoids. Recently, rituximab has been proposed as an alternative treatment for LN. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen receptor on B cells. The aim of this review is to summarize all the available information about rituximab in LN. Eleven studies were found; three of them were observational studies (2 prospective and 1 retrospective) and eight were clinical trials (7 open-label studies and only 1 randomized controlled trial [RCT]). The evidence is insufficient to establish the role of rituximab in the treatment of LN. Results from the only RCT, which were negative, suggest a clinical benefit in black people. Further studies must confirm this hypothesis. Controlled clinical trials involving adaptive randomization are required to establish the real benefit of rituximab in LN.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5323cf058f6100044b2","authors":["Zurita Gavilanes, Luis","Costa Valarezo, Aldo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.reuma.2016.01.001","endpage":"215","first_seen_on":"2016-08-03T17:24:22+00:00","issns":["1885-1398","1699258X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Reumatologia Clinica","last_mentioned_on":1470245026,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26906063\/?i=1&from=nefritis%20lupus"],"pmid":"26906063","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"210","subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Rituximab en nefritis l\u00fapica: una revisi\u00f3n no sistem\u00e1tica","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rituximab-en-nefritis-l%C3%BApica-una-revisi%C3%B3n-sistem%C3%A1tica"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":7063151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257660,"mean":11.998262393318,"rank":217682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257660,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173,"mean":2.2328372093023,"rank":128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.91875,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Unspecified":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"EC":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IlindelatorreMD\/statuses\/760888907567394816","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10249237],"posted_on":"2016-08-03T17:23:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Ilin Gilberto dlT","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/836054970407452676\/xjxB0SNL_normal.jpg","description":"M\u00e9dico Internista.
