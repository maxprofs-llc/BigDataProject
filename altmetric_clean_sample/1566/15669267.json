However, clinical trials have revealed that these inhibitors predisposed patients to a significantly increased cardiovascular risk, consisting of thrombosis, hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Thus, microsomal prostaglandin E (PGE) synthase-1 (mPGES-1), the key terminal enzyme involved in the synthesis of inflammatory prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and the four PGE2 receptors (EP1-4) have gained much attention as alternative targets for the development of novel analgesics. The cardiovascular consequences of targeting mPGES-1 and the PGE2 receptors are substantially studied. Inhibition of mPGES-1 has displayed a relatively innocuous or preferable cardiovascular profile. The modulation of the four EP receptors in cardiovascular system is diversely reported as well. In this review, we highlight the most recent advances from our and other studies on the regulation of PGE2, particularly mPGES-1 and the four PGE2 receptors, in cardiovascular function, with a particular emphasis on blood pressure regulation, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and myocardial infarction. This might lead to new avenues to improve cardiovascular disease management strategies and to seek optimized anti-inflammatory therapeutic options.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008425","authors":["Yang, Guangrui","Chen, Lihong"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/5249086","endpage":"9","first_seen_on":"2017-01-22T16:31:06+00:00","issns":["1942-0994","1942-0900"],"journal":"Oxidative Medicine & Cellular Longetivity","last_mentioned_on":1485102660,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27594972"],"pmid":"27594972","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","subjects":["metabolism","cellbiology"],"title":"\n              An Update of Microsomal Prostaglandin E Synthase-1 and PGE\n              2\n              Receptors in Cardiovascular Health and Diseases\n            ","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/omcl\/2016\/5249086\/","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/update-microsomal-prostaglandin-e-synthase1-pge2-receptors-cardiovascular-health-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088508,"mean":6.8823654995833,"rank":2037878,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4944825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088508,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260566,"mean":12.830555922706,"rank":90931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":164947,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260566,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":803,"mean":4.1993042394015,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":604,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":803,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":3.1935945945946,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
