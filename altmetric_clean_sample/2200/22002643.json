It is correlated with the necessity for these larval stages to be ingested by the blood feeding vector before they can be transmitted to a new vertebrate host. Microfilariae of the dog heartworm Dirofilaria immitis have been described to show periodicity, but the circadian pattern does not seem to be consistent. Most publications describe the lowest mff-concentrations in the peripheral blood in the early morning, while the highest counts occurred either in the afternoon, in the late evening or shortly after midnight. Sixteen dogs were experimentally infected with D. immitis isolates originating from Italy (one isolate, 14 dogs), and the USA (two isolates, one dog each). The dogs were housed indoors with a natural light source (windows) and heating that prevented temperature-drops below 20\u00b0C during winter. When patency was reached, blood samples were collected at weekly and monthly intervals over a period of up to 3 years, and at given hours of the day (morning, noon, evening) for the duration of one year in order to determine seasonal, as well as daily variations of microfilaremia. Despite the fact that the dogs were kept indoors, there was an apparent seasonality of the D. immitis-microfilaremia, with peaks in summer and 5-49-times lower counts in winter. This difference was statistically significant and the ratio remained constant over the years, regardless of the fact that the mff-counts increased from the first to the second year of patency. Since the temperature was kept constantly in a range between 20 to 26\u00b0C (with some single outliners in both directions) the climatic conditions may not explain this observation. Therefore, day length may be the most obvious reason for the seasonality in the given study set-up. Interestingly, the Italian D. immitis-isolate lost seasonality after three passages of experimental infections in dogs. The circadian cycle of mff in the peripheral blood varied considerably between dogs and season. There was no consistent or apparent pattern, which led to the conclusion that many individual factors seem to influence the appearance of mff in the peripheral blood, even, or especially, under standardized environmental conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fd","authors":["Lovis, L\u00e9onore","Grandjean, M\u00e9lanie","Overney, Laurence","Seewald, Wolfgang","Sager, Heinz"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vetpar.2017.07.010","first_seen_on":"2017-07-17T12:36:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0304-4017","03044017","1873-2550"],"journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1500294998,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0304401717303096?dgcid=raven_sd_aip_email"],"pmid":"28807299","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Fisheries Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Seasonality and circadian variation of microfilaremia in dogs experimentally infected with  Dirofilaria immitis","type":"article","volume":"243","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/seasonality-circadian-variation-microfilaremia-dogs-experimentally-infected-dirofilaria-immitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223669,"mean":6.9683210333815,"rank":7116973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223669,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159221,"mean":11.821498969979,"rank":130482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159221,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1775,"mean":1.9233675310034,"rank":1310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1775,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.635,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Albinovet\/statuses\/886927624777474048","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22002643],"posted_on":"2017-07-17T12:36:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefano Cattaneo DVM","url":"http:\/\/veterinarialbino.com\/\/twitter_en.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1673372763\/vet_tweet_normal.png","description":"Daily updates about pet health covering the last articles published in veterinary journals.","id_on_source":"Albinovet","tweeter_id":"418669767","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2107},"tweet_id":"886927624777474048"}]}}
