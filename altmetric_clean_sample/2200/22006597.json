The emergence of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor detectors capable of detecting individual electrons has enabled the collection of low dose, high contrast images, opening the door for reliable correlation-based tilt-series alignment. Here we present a set of automated, correlation-based tilt-series alignment, contrast transfer function (CTF) correction, and reconstruction workflows for use in conjunction with the Appion\/Leginon package that are primarily targeted at automating structure determination with cryogenic electron microscopy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f3d","authors":["Alex J.
