Characteristic fragmentations were identified and evaluated as possible indicators for the presence of oxidized methionine residues in peptides. It was found that the elimination of CH3SOH (-64 u) from [M + H]+ is unique for peptides that contain methionine sulphoxide. Sequence ions containing the oxidized methionine undergo the same elimination, allowing unambiguous sequence determination. Methionine sulphone exhibits an analogous elimination of CH3SO2H (-80 u) from the protonated molecule, but not from sequence ions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f6100086ec","authors":["Fija M.
