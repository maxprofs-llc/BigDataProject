At the end of the study, HbA1c was 0.6% lower in the metformin group than in the placebo group (P < 0.05). This was achieved at lower daily insulin dosages (metformin group -0.14 +\/- 0.1 vs. placebo group 0.02 +\/- 0.2 units. kg(-1). day(-1); P < 0.05), with no significant change in BMI. Fasting glucose levels improved significantly in the metformin group (P < 0.05). Change in insulin sensitivity, measured by FSIGT, was not significantly different between the two groups at study end. Mild hypoglycemia occurred more frequently in the metformin-treated than in the placebo subjects (1.75 +\/- 0.8 vs. 0.9 +\/- 0.4 events. patient(-1). week(-1); P = 0.03). There were no differences in frequency of severe hypoglycemic episodes or gastrointestinal complaints between the two groups.\nMetformin treatment lowered HbA1c and decreased insulin dosage with no weight gain in teens with type 1 diabetes in poor metabolic control. Changes in insulin sensitivity were not documented in this study using the FSIGT. Long-term studies will determine whether these improvements are sustained and whether certain subgroups accrue greater benefit from this therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f8","authors":["Hamilton, Jill","Cummings, Elizabeth","Zdravkovic, Vera","Finegood, Diane","Daneman, Denis"],"first_seen_on":"2017-06-05T15:49:40+00:00","issns":["0149-5992"],"issue":"1","journal":"Diabetes Care","last_mentioned_on":1496677766,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12502670"],"pmid":"12502670","pubdate":"2003-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Metformin as an adjunct therapy in adolescents with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance: a randomized controlled trial.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metformin-adjunct-therapy-adolescents-type-1-diabetes-insulin-resistance-randomized-controlled-trial-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":6313652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1126531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241551,"mean":12.288780840406,"rank":170564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44750,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241551,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5833,"mean":14.780559327846,"rank":5116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5833,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":21.029710843373,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
