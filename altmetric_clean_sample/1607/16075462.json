Focus group data revealed that consumption of host country news media was mainly connected to immigrants' deliberate strategies to assimilate the culture, politics and language of the host society, while exposure to transnational news was viewed in terms of strategies of integration in both countries. We also observed that participants' educational background and language skills combined with their perceptions of the host country's news have an impact on the use they make of news for assimilating and\/or integrating into the host society. Finally, important sociopolitical conditions of the context influenced the ways participants use the news media in their process of acculturation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000282c","authors":["Amanda Alencar","Mark Deuze"],"doi":"10.1177\/0267323117689993","first_seen_on":"2017-02-03T13:42:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0267-3231","1460-3705"],"issue":"2","journal":"European Journal of Communication","last_mentioned_on":1488403899,"links":["http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/0267323117689993","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/0267323117689993","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/0267323117689993#.WJSFyvPbzlY.facebook"],"pmcid":"PMC5439377","pmid":"28579663","pubdate":"2017-06-06T22:07:53+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Film, Television And Digital Media","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Journalism And Professional Writing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Communication And Media Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Arts and Humanities"],"title":"News for assimilation or integration?
