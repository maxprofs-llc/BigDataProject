OBJECTIVE: Determine if reproduction in female Drosophila drives elevated P:C intake. Distinguish whether such a\u00a0preference is driven by egg production or from male-derived sex peptides in seminal fluid. METHODS: Intake of protein and carbohydrate was measured in a\u00a0diet-choice assay. Macronutrient intake was calculated for mated and unmated fertile females, mated and unmated sterile females, and both types of female when mated to wildtype males and to males lacking sex peptide. RESULTS: Mated females have high P:C intake relative to unmated females and mated, sterile females. Fertile females mated to wildtype males and to males lacking sex peptide have high P:C intake, but sterile females have similar, low P:C intake when unmated and when mated to males lacking sex peptide. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic demands of egg production and sex peptides are individually sufficient to drive elevated P:C intake in adult female Drosophila. Reproductive state can thus modulate how animals consume macronutrients, which in turn can impact their health and aging.","authors":["Bowman, Elizabeth","Tatar, Marc"],"doi":"10.3233\/nha-1613","first_seen_on":"2017-02-03T11:33:07+00:00","issns":["24519480","24519502","2451-9480"],"issue":"1","journal":"Nutrition and Healthy Aging","last_mentioned_on":1486121562,"links":["http:\/\/content.iospress.com\/articles\/nutrition-and-healthy-aging\/nha1613"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/content.iospress.com\/download\/nutrition-and-healthy-aging\/nha1613?id=nutrition-and-healthy-aging%2Fnha1613","pmcid":"PMC5166518","pmid":"28035342","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOS Press","title":"Reproduction regulates Drosophila nutrient intake through independent effects of egg production and sex peptide: Implications for aging","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.medra.org\/servlet\/aliasResolver?alias=iospress&doi=10.3233\/NHA-1613","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reproduction-regulates-drosophila-nutrient-intake-through-independent-effects-egg-production-sex-pep"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
