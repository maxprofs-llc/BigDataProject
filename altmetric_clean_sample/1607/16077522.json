Animal studies support this association and demonstrate that maternal immune activation changes brain morphology and inflammatory cytokines in the adult offspring. Evidence for changes in inflammatory cytokines is also demonstrated in human post-mortem brain and peripheral blood studies from subjects with psychiatric disorders. This perspective briefly highlights convincing evidence from epidemiological, preclinical and human pathological studies to support the role of maternal immune activation in major psychiatric disorders. A better understanding of the link between maternal immune activation and brain development in psychiatric disorders will lead to the development of novel immunomodulatory interventions for individuals at risk for psychiatric disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031aa","authors":["Gustavo Scola","Angela Duong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuroscience.2017.01.033","first_seen_on":"2017-02-03T15:07:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03064522","1873-7544"],"journal":"Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1501512096,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0306452217300465","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28153689","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0306452217300465?via%3Dihub"],"pmid":"28153689","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Prenatal maternal immune activation and brain development with relevance to psychiatric disorders","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0306452217300465","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prenatal-maternal-immune-activation-brain-development-relevance-psychiatric-disorders-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302353,"mean":6.9982161057411,"rank":3494139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4755385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302353,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273605,"mean":12.638865857224,"rank":111387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":159683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273605,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3474,"mean":4.1020253383242,"rank":1440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":1998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3474,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":3.7719056603774,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
