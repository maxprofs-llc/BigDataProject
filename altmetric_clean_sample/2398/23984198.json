We report a case of altered acetaminophen toxicokinetics due to delayed gastrointestinal absorption, likely secondary to intestinal trauma\/surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Case ReportA 37-year-old woman ingested an unknown amount of acetaminophen and ethanol then stabbed herself in the abdomen. The initial acetaminophen was 1,285.9 \u03bcmol\/L and the time of ingestion was not known. Intravenous acetylcysteine protocol was started. She developed an ileus post-surgery for the stab wounds. At 31 hours post-presentation, the acetaminophen returned undetectable, and the transaminases were normal. After the resolution of the ileus, repeated acetaminophen peaked at 363.3 \u03bcmol\/L 52 hours post-admission. At 76 hours post-admission, the acetaminophen was undetectable, and transaminases and coagulation parameters were normal.\u00a0ConclusionsReduction in gastrointestinal motility secondary to trauma and\/or surgery must be considered when determining when to initiate or discontinue treatment as well as how long to monitor acetaminophen concentrations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006daf","authors":["Alyahya, B","Tamur, S","Aljenedil, S","Larocuque, A","Holody, E","Gosselin, S"],"first_seen_on":"2017-08-17T15:00:30+00:00","issns":["1710-6222"],"issue":"2","journal":"The Canadian Journal of Clinical Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1502982010,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27463118?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27463118","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Double-peaked Acetaminophen Concentration Secondary to Intestinal Trauma.","type":"article","volume":"23"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":4478169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2335127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167654,"mean":12.751656087276,"rank":92319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":58691,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167654,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":3.2510461538462,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Xenpaper\/statuses\/898197767603879936","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23984198],"posted_on":"2017-08-17T15:00:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Xenpapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/715888053840179200\/Cu3Oo1ci_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot of #Xenopus papers in #Pubmed.
