The orthogonal geometry between the donor unit and the 2,2'-bipyrimidine accepting core facilitated a HOMO\/LUMO spatial separation, thus realizing thermally activated delayed fluorescence. They exhibited electroluminescence ranging from green to yellow, depending on the donor unit, with a maximum external quantum efficiencies of up to 17.1%.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Park, Hee\u2010Jun","Han, Si Hyun","Lee, Jun Yeob","Hee-Jun Park","Si Hyun Han","Jun Yeob Lee"],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201700889","first_seen_on":"2017-08-15T07:59:59+00:00","issns":["18614728","1861-471X"],"journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1502839054,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201700889\/abstract;jsessionid=1ED286E4F532A9BD8BC7BF72E0D8CDA1.f02t04","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/asia.201700889?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/asia.201700889"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201700889\/pdf","pmid":"28695621","pubdate":"2017-08-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Molecular design of thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters using 2,2'-bipyrimidine as an acceptor in donor-acceptor structure","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-design-thermally-activated-delayed-fluorescent-emitters-using-22bipyrimidine-acceptor-dono"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":6360008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1136052,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181261,"mean":12.377013880614,"rank":128131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":32909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181261,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2559,"mean":1.3923010164191,"rank":944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2559,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":1.5221590909091,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
