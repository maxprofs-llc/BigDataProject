In this study, by taking different month old Alzheimer's mice as models, we have explored the possibility of the target bioimaging of the diseased sites through the initial injection of zinc gluconate solution into Alzheimer's model mice post tail-vein, and then combination of the further injection of ferrous chloride (FeCl2) solution into the same Alzheimer's model mice post stomach. Our observations indicate that both zinc gluconate solution and FeCl2 solution could cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for biosynthesizing the fluorescent zinc oxide nanoclusters and magnetic iron oxide nanoclusters, respectively, in the lesions area of the AD model mice, and thus enable the high spatiotemporal dual-modality bio-imaging (i.e., including fluorescence bio-imaging (FL) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) of Alzheimer's disease for the first time. The result presents a novel promising strategy for the rapid and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fd3","authors":["Lai, Lanmei","Jiang, Xuerui","Han, Shanying","Zhao, Chunqiu","Du, Tianyu","Rehman, Fawad ur","Zheng, Youkun","Li, Xiaoqi","Liu, Xiaoli","Jiang, Hui","Wang, Xuemei"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.langmuir.7b01516","first_seen_on":"2017-08-15T10:31:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0743-7463","1520-5827"],"journal":"Langmuir","last_mentioned_on":1502905933,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28806518?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28806518","pubdate":"2017-08-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society (ACS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"In vivo biosynthesized zinc and iron oxide nanoclusters for high spatiotemporal dual-modality bioimaging of Alzheimer\u2019s disease","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vivo-biosynthesized-zinc-iron-oxide-nanoclusters-high-spatiotemporal-dualmodality-bioimaging-alzheim"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":3981141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4219035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184213,"mean":12.365889670597,"rank":84087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":94564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184213,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2909,"mean":2.8483817056396,"rank":805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":2035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2909,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":1.4469230769231,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
