MymA (Rv3083), a 55\u00a0kDa\u00a0M.tb flavin containing monooxygenase, is involved in modification of mycolic acids during acidic shock following M.tb internalization in macrophage. In this study, we have investigated the role of this cell wall associated protein in activation of macrophages by toll like receptor (TLRs) engagement and subsequent signaling. Our results showed that MymA stimulation of THP1 cells and human monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) lead to upregulation of TLR2 and co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR. This upregulation is partially reduced by TLR2 blocking antibodies. The activation of macrophage following MymA stimulation also resulted in release of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12. Moreover, MymA also polarized the immune response towards TH1 as shown by an increased IFN-\u03b3 level in the supernatant of stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In consensus with the TLR2 signaling involving MyD88 and NF-\u03baB, we also observed several fold increase in mRNA for TLR2, MyD88 and NF-\u03baB on MymA induction of THP-1 and MDM by qRT-PCR. The increased production of NF-\u03baB following recognition of MymA by TLR2 was further confirmed by HEK-TLR2 reporter cell line colorimetric assay. In conclusion, immunological evaluation revealed that MymA is a TLR2 agonist that upregulates signaling via MyD88 and NF-\u03baB in macrophages to stimulate the release of proinflammatory cytokines. The MymA protein should be investigated further for expression in recombinant BCG as a pre-exposure vaccine or as a post-exposure subunit vaccine candidate.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c14","authors":["Iti Saraav","Swati Singh","Kirti Pandey","Monika Sharma","Sadhna Sharma"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tube.2017.05.005","first_seen_on":"2017-08-15T10:00:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["14729792","1873-281X"],"journal":"Tuberculosis (formerly Tubercle and Lung Disease)","last_mentioned_on":1502791245,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28802400?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28802400","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis MymA is a TLR2 agonist that activate macrophages and a T H 1 response","type":"article","volume":"106","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mycobacterium-tuberculosis-myma-tlr2-agonist-activate-macrophages-th1-response"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":7244357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181201,"mean":12.380628178808,"rank":148353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181201,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":400,"mean":2.489954887218,"rank":299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":400,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":0.64772727272727,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
