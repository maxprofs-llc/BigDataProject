Patients underwent mpMRI and F-DCFBC PET\/CT within a 3 months' window. Lesions seen on mpMRI were biopsied under transrectal ultrasound\/MRI fusion-guided biopsy, or a radical prostatectomy was performed. F-DCFBC PET\/CT and mpMRI were evaluated blinded and separately for tumor detection on a lesion basis. For PET image analysis, MRI and F-DCFBC PET images were fused by using software registration; imaging findings were correlated with histology, and uptake of F-DCFBC in tumors was compared with uptake in benign prostatic hyperplasia nodules and normal peripheral zone tissue using the 80% threshold SUVmax.\nA total of 25 tumor foci (mean size, 1.8 cm; median size, 1.5 cm; range, 0.6-4.7 cm) were histopathologically identified in 13 patients. Sensitivity rates of F-DCFBC PET\/CT and mpMRI were 36% and 96%, respectively, for all tumors. For index lesions, the largest tumor with highest Gleason score, sensitivity rates of F-DCFBC PET\/CT and mpMRI were 61.5% and 92%, respectively. The average SUVmax for primary prostate cancer was higher (5.8 \u00b1 4.4) than that of benign prostatic hyperplasia nodules (2.1 \u00b1 0.3) or that of normal prostate tissue (2.1 \u00b1 0.4) at 1 hour postinjection (P = 0.0033).\nThe majority of index prostate cancers are detected with F-DCFBC PET\/CT, and this may be a prognostic indicator based on uptake and staging. However, for detecting prostate cancer with high sensitivity, it is important to combine prostate-specific membrane antigen PET\/CT with mpMRI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f10","authors":["Turkbey, Baris","Mena, Esther","Lindenberg, Liza","Adler, Stephen","Bednarova, Sandra","Berman, Rose","Ton, Anita T.","McKinney, Yolanda","Eclarinal, Philip","Hill, Craig","Afari, George","Bhattacharyya, Sibaprasad","Mease, Ronnie C.","Merino, Maria J.","Jacobs, Paula M.","Wood, Bradford J.","Pinto, Peter A.","Pomper, Martin G.","Choyke, Peter L."],"doi":"10.1097\/rlu.0000000000001804","first_seen_on":"2017-08-15T11:24:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0363-9762","1536-0229"],"issue":"10","journal":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1506434160,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28806263","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28806263?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/18F_DCFBC_Prostate_Specific_Membrane.97949.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/Fulltext\/2017\/10000\/18F_DCFBC_Prostate_Specific_Membrane.1.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/9000\/00000\/18F_DCFBC_Prostate_Specific_Membrane.97949.pdf","pmid":"28806263","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"735","subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"18F-DCFBC Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen\u2013Targeted PET\/CT Imaging in Localized Prostate Cancer","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/18F_DCFBC_Prostate_Specific_Membrane.97949.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/18fdcfbc-prostatespecific-membrane-antigentargeted-petct-imaging-localized-prostate-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.3,"score_history":{"1y":9.3,"6m":9.3,"3m":9.3,"1m":2.75,"1w":0.5,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":958349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7502413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":221701,"mean":12.482922273342,"rank":36753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":184859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":221701,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2366,"mean":1.0242097251586,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":2352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2366,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":0.61578947368421,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":8,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/radiolobt\/statuses\/897418629377134594","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23848592],"posted_on":"2017-08-15T11:24:09+00:00","author":{"name":"B_Turkbey_Radiology","url":"https:\/\/ccr.cancer.gov\/Molecular-Imaging-Program\/ismail-baris-turkbey","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/804542063186505728\/mhdaKapd_normal.jpg","description":"RTs, \u2764\ufe0fs and follows do not necessarily mean support...
