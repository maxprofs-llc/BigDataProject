In recent years, winter wheat has been increasingly sown extremely late in early to mid-November after harvesting cotton or pepper. To improve water use efficiency (WUE) and guide the extremely late sowing practices, a 3-year field experiment was conducted under two irrigation regimes (W1, one-irrigation, 75 mm at jointing; W2, two-irrigation, 75 mm at jointing and 75 mm at anthesis) in 3 cultivars differing in spike size (HS4399, small spike; JM22, medium spike; WM8, large spike). Wheat was sown in early to mid-November at a high seeding rate of 800-850 seeds m-2. Average yields of 7.42 t ha-1 and WUE of 1.84 kg m-3 were achieved with an average seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) of 404 mm. Compared with W2, wheat under W1 did not have yield penalty in 2 of 3 years, and had 7.9% lower seasonal ET and 7.5% higher WUE. The higher WUE and stable yield under W1 was associated with higher 1000-grain weight (TGW) and harvest index (HI). Among the 3 cultivars, JM22 had 5.9%-8.9% higher yield and 4.2%-9.3% higher WUE than WM8 and HS4399. The higher yield in JM22 was attributed mainly to higher HI and TGW due to increased post-anthesis biomass and deeper seasonal soil water extraction. In conclusion, one-irrigation with a medium-sized spike cultivar JM22 could be a useful strategy to maintain yield and high WUE in extremely late-sown winter wheat at a high seeding rate in the NCP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Wang, Bin","Zhang, Yinghua","Hao, Baozhen","Xu, Xuexin","Zhao, Zhigan","Wang, Zhimin","Xue, Qingwu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0153695","first_seen_on":"2016-04-22T13:27:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1473338974,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27100187?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27100187","pubdate":"2016-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0153695","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Grain Yield and Water Use Efficiency in Extremely-Late Sown Winter Wheat Cultivars under Two Irrigation Regimes in the North China Plain","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/grain-yield-water-efficiency-extremelylate-sown-winter-wheat-cultivars-under-two-irrigation-regimes-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8348788,"mean":7.0413328717018,"rank":6037372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2013009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8348788,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272534,"mean":11.525153929982,"rank":174225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":82264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272534,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115335,"mean":10.62715712626,"rank":78471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":31048,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115335,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5149,"mean":13.436327894328,"rank":3701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5149,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
