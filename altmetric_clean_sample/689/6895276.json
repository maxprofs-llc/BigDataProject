To confirm this hypothesis, proteins from C. albicans cells after 3h of interaction with macrophages were analyzed using two quantitative proteomic approaches. Fifty-one and 97 proteins were identified as differentially expressed by DIGE and iTRAQ, respectively. The proteins identified and quantified were different, with only 7 in common, but classified in the same functional categories. The analyses of their functions indicated that an increase in the metabolism of amino acids, and purine nucleotides were taking place, while the glycolysis and translation levels dropped after 3h of interaction. Also, the response to oxidative stress and protein translation were reduced. In addition, 7 substrates of metacaspase (Mca1) were identified (Cdc48, Fba1, Gpm1, Pmm1, Rct1, Ssb1, Tal1) as decreased in abundance, plus 12 proteins previously described as related to apoptosis. Besides, the monitoring of apoptotic markers along 24 h of interaction: caspase-like activity, TUNEL assay, measurement of ROS and cell examination by transmission electron microscopy, revealed that apoptotic processes took place for 30% of the fungal cells, thus supporting the proteomic results and the hypothesis of macrophages killing C. albicans by apoptosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e0f","authors":["Cabez\u00f3n, Virginia","Vial\u00e1s, Vital","Gil-Bona, Ana","Reales-Calder\u00f3n, Jose Antonio","Mart\u00ednez-Gomariz, Montserrat","Guti\u00e9rrez-Bl\u00e1zquez, Dolores","Monteoliva, Luc\u00eda","Molero, Gloria","Ramsdale, Mark","Gil, Concha","Virginia Cabez\u00f3n"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jproteome.5b00913","first_seen_on":"2016-04-22T12:47:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1535-3907","1535-3893"],"journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","last_mentioned_on":1461649364,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27048922","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jproteome.5b00913"],"pmid":"27048922","pubdate":"2016-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"\n              Apoptosis of\n              Candida albicans\n              during the interaction with murine macrophages: Proteomics and cell death marker monitoring.\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/apoptosis-candida-albicans-during-interaction-murine-macrophages-proteomics-celldeath-marker-monitor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7607694,"mean":6.5509374902442,"rank":3653565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3893642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7607694,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267123,"mean":11.33176170439,"rank":130571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":133791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267123,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2741,"mean":3.6684065693431,"rank":1210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2741,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":5.3232888888889,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
