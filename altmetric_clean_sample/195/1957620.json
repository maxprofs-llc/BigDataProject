Here, we demonstrate up to ~ 10(2) times enhancements of the emission intensities from InAs NWs by growing an InAsP shell to produce core-shell NWs. By systematically varying the thickness and phosphorus (P)-content of the InAsP shell, we demonstrate the ability to further tune the emission energy via large strain-induced peak shifts that already exceed >100 meV at comparatively low fractional P-contents. Increasing the P-content is found to give rise to additional line width broadening due to asymmetric shell growth generated by a unique transition from {110}- to {112}-sidewall growth as confirmed by cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy. The results also elucidate the detrimental effects of plastic strain relaxation on the emission characteristics, particularly in core-shell structures with very high P-content and shell thickness. Overall, our findings highlight that enhanced mid-infrared emission efficiencies with effective carrier confinement and suppression of nonradiative recombination are highly sensitive to the quality of the InAs-InAsP core-shell interface.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Julian Treu","Michael Bormann","Hannes Schmeiduch","Markus D\u00f6blinger","Stefanie Mork\u00f6tter","Sonja Matich","Peter Wiecha","Kai Saller","Benedikt Mayer","Max Bichler","Markus-Christian Amann","Jonathan J.
