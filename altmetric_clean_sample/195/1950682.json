The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7294919 is likely a schizophrenia-susceptibility variant according to its significant association with hippocampal volume, hippocampus function, and cognitive performance as well as the nominal association with schizophrenia. However, all previous analyses were conducted only in Europeans, and whether rs7294919 is associated with schizophrenia in other populations are yet to be tested. Here, we conducted a case-control analysis of rs7294919 with schizophrenia in six independent Chinese (N = 3) and Japanese (N = 3) samples, including a total of 7,352 cases and 10,824 controls. The results of our association analysis were not able to confirm the association of rs7294919 with schizophrenia (p = 0.51 in total samples, odds ratio = 1.02 for allele[C]). The absence of rs7294919's association in Chinese and Japanese suggest a potential genetic heterogeneity in the susceptibility of schizophrenia on this locus and also demonstrate the difficulties in replicating associations of schizophrenia across different ethnic populations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Jiewei Liu","Shusuke Numata","Masashi Ikeda","Yuichiro Watanabe","Xue-bin Zheng","Xiongjian Luo","Makoto Kinoshita","Ayako Nunokawa","Toshiyuki Someya","Tetsuro Ohmori","Jin-xin Bei","Siow-Ann Chong","Jimmy Lee","Zhiqiang Li","Jianjun Liu","Nakao Iwata","Yongyong Shi","Ming Li","Bing Su","Chunyu Liu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0080696","first_seen_on":"2013-12-03T05:00:44+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1406494809,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0080696;jsessionid=49263E4895C0E461BB71D1F41D861087","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0080696;jsessionid=B8718644221EB70EAEAB31DBC26ECD66","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0080696;jsessionid=0E9C9F707518E7C45AB91EBAC22E4BB7","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0080696;jsessionid=7CCC1EC671208BBA2C0A7D1B6AB2F85B","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0080696;jsessionid=89CE1551D7AAA1F0E6066697384B7480","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0080696;jsessionid=F62299C133C5EC6013E0171EBB97BE9B","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0080696"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0080696.pdf","pmid":"24278305","pubdate":"2013-11-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e80696","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"An Evaluation of Association between a Novel Hippocampal Biology Related SNP (rs7294919) and Schizophrenia","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0080696","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-association-between-novel-hippocampal-biology-related-snp-rs7294919-schizophrenia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":3554285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":836045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131539,"mean":7.3515752558199,"rank":87095,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":24999,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131539,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88911,"mean":9.2651301540885,"rank":64849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":14287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88911,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7285,"mean":8.9686523887974,"rank":5035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7285,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
