We reviewed the status of knowledge, in preterm children, on the development of fine motor skills, the relation with gross motor skills, and risk factors for impaired fine motor skills. We searched the past 15 years in PubMed, using ['motor skills' or 'fine motor function' and 'preterm infant'] as the search string. Impaired gross and fine motor skills are among the most frequently occurring problems encountered by preterm children who do not develop cerebral palsy. The prevalence is around 40% for mild to moderate impairment and 20% for moderate impairment. Fine motor skill scores on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children are about 0.62 of a standard deviation lower compared with term children. Risk factors for fine motor impairments include moderately preterm birth (odds ratio [OR] 2.0) and, among very preterm children (<32 wk gestation), intra-uterine growth restriction (ORs 2-3), inflammatory conditions (late-onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis, ORs 3-5), and dexamethasone therapy for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (OR 2.7). A better understanding of factors that play a role in the development of and recovery from brain injury could guide future intervention attempts aimed at improving fine motor skills of preterm children.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f3","authors":["Arend F Bos","Koenraad N J A Van Braeckel","Marrit M Hitzert","Jozien C Tanis","Elise Roze","Bos AF","Van Braeckel KN","Hitzert MM","Tanis JC","Roze E"],"doi":"10.1111\/dmcn.12297","endpage":"4","first_seen_on":"2013-12-03T14:23:06+00:00","issns":["1469-8749","0012-1622","00121622"],"journal":"Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1386080455,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24237270"],"pmid":"24237270","pubdate":"2013-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["neurology","pediatrics"],"title":"Development of fine motor skills in preterm infants.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/dmcn.12297","volume":"55 Suppl 4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-fine-motor-skills-preterm-infants-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3064931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121776,"mean":7.209734313283,"rank":79626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":27236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121776,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1185,"mean":2.4994831081081,"rank":775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1185,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.9388888888889,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
