In granular metals, electron hops arising from series of virtual transitions are predicted to yield observable currents at low-enough temperatures, but to date experimental evidence is lacking. We report on electron transport in granular graphene films self-assembled by hydrogenation of suspended graphene. While the log-conductance shows a characteristic T(-1\/2) temperature dependence, cooling the samples below 10\u2005K drives a triple crossover: a slope break in log-conductance, simultaneous to a substantial increase in magneto-conductance and onset of large mesoscopic conductance fluctuations. These phenomena are signatures of virtual transitions of electrons between distant localized states, and conductance statistics reveal that the high crossover-temperature is due to the Dirac nature of granular graphene charge carriers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Alexandre Pachoud","Manu Jaiswal","Yu Wang","Byung-Hee Hong","Jong-Hyun Ahn","Kian Ping Loh","Barbaros Ozyilmaz"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep03404","first_seen_on":"2013-12-04T13:17:35+00:00","issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1386163042,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24296942?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24296942","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Electronic properties and materials","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Surfaces, interfaces and thin films","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Quantum mechanics","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Multiple virtual tunneling of dirac fermions in granular graphene.","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiple-virtual-tunneling-dirac-fermions-granular-graphene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3064840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122069,"mean":7.199449044795,"rank":79777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":27299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122069,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10918,"mean":11.16184299716,"rank":7466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":2289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10918,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":716,"mean":7.8597818181818,"rank":478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":716,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
