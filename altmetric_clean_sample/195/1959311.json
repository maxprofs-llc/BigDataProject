The reasons why only very few nanoparticle-based medicines are on the market or in late clinical trials are discussed and some new approaches are identified. Future challenges in the nanoparticle field are also identified.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000217e","authors":["P.
