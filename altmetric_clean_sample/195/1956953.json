Traceurs and untrained novices estimated the height of walls and reported their anticipated ability to climb the wall. The traceurs perceived the walls as shorter than did novices. This result suggests that perception is scaled by the perceiver's anticipated ability to act, and is consistent with the action-specific account of perception.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d13cf058f610000bb6","authors":["J Eric T Taylor","Jessica K Witt","Mila Sugovic"],"doi":"10.1068\/p6855","endpage":"760","first_seen_on":"2013-12-05T06:20:12+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0301-0066","1468-4233"],"issue":"6","journal":"Perception","last_mentioned_on":1460390400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21936305","http:\/\/pec.sagepub.com\/content\/40\/6\/757.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pec.sagepub.com\/content\/40\/6\/757.full.pdf","pmid":"21936305","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE PublicationsSage UK: London, England","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"757","subjects":["psychophysiology","psychology"],"title":"When walls are no longer barriers: perception of wall height in parkour.","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/walls-longer-barriers-perception-wall-height-parkour"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7534762,"mean":6.5107844469081,"rank":919281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":6611409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7534762,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174088,"mean":6.7037649910679,"rank":22094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":151964,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174088,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":644,"mean":7.1318973561431,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":644,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":6.6330909090909,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
