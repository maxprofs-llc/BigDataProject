Previous studies were confined to areal bone mineral density measurement that was a two-dimensional investigation for a three-dimensional structure. Evaluation of volumetric BMD (vBMD) and other bone quality parameters are important for gaining in-depth understanding of the etiopathogenesis of AIS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a8","authors":["Yu, Wing-sze","Chan, Ka-yan","Yu, Fiona W.P.","Yeung, Hiu-yan","Ng, Bobby K.W.","Lee, Kwong-man","Lam, Tsz-ping","Cheng, Jack C.Y."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.spinee.2013.05.018","first_seen_on":"2013-12-05T20:13:59+00:00","issns":["1529-9430"],"journal":"Spine Journal","last_mentioned_on":1386274426,"links":["http:\/\/www.thespinejournalonline.com\/article\/S1529-9430(13)00527-5\/abstract?elsca1=etoc&elsca2=email&elsca3=1529-9430_201311_13_11&elsca4=elsevier"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.thespinejournalonline.com\/article\/S1529-9430(13)00527-5\/pdf","pmid":"23791202","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Abnormal bone quality versus low bone mineral density in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: a case-control study with in\u00a0vivo high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/abnormal-bone-quality-versus-low-bone-mineral-density-adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-casecontrol-st-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9199431259457,"rank":2017786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112726,"mean":6.975801250832,"rank":56489,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":31678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112726,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1091,"mean":3.4922697247706,"rank":684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1091,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225,"mean":3.6215178571429,"rank":127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/zrail222\/status\/408690681377325056","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1958857],"posted_on":"2013-12-05T20:13:46+00:00","author":{"name":"zrail","image":"http:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_4_normal.png","description":"","id_on_source":"zrail222","tweeter_id":"175175571","followers":1},"tweet_id":"408690681377325056"}]}}
