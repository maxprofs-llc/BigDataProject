It can cause a febrile disease, milk drop, diarrhea, and fetal malformation in ruminants. SBV, a member of the Simbu serogroup within the genus Orthobunyavirus, is closely related to Akabane virus (AKAV) and Aino virus (AINOV) among others. In the present study, 4 Holstein-Friesian calves were immunized twice four weeks apart with a multivalent, inactivated vaccine against AKAV and AINOV. Another 4 calves were kept as unvaccinated controls. All animals were clinically, serologically and virologically examined before and after challenge infection with SBV. AKAV- and AINOV-specific neutralizing antibodies were detected one week before challenge infection, while SBV-specific antibodies were detectable only thereafter. SBV genome was detected in all vaccinated animals and 3 out of 4 controls in serum samples taken after challenge infection. In conclusion, the investigated vaccine was not able to prevent an SBV-infection. Thus, vaccines for other related Simbu serogroup viruses can not substitute SBV-specific vaccines as an instrument for disease control.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008a8","doi":"10.1186\/1297-9716-44-114","first_seen_on":"2013-12-05T15:55:30+00:00","issns":["1297-9716"],"issue":"1","journal":"Veterinary Research","last_mentioned_on":1386258917,"links":["http:\/\/www.veterinaryresearch.org\/content\/44\/1\/114\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.veterinaryresearch.org\/content\/pdf\/1297-9716-44-114.pdf","pmid":"24313924","pubdate":"2013-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"startpage":"114","title":"Evaluating the protective efficacy of a trivalent vaccine containing Akabane virus, Aino virus and Chuzan virus against Schmallenberg virus infection","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluating-protective-efficacy-trivalent-vaccine-containing-akabane-virus-aino-virus-chuzan-virus-ag"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3079559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":959388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122187,"mean":7.2079255724881,"rank":81232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":27708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122187,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":417,"mean":2.6712740384615,"rank":319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":417,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.2171764705882,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
