Therefore, a literature search was carried out in Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and oncology conferences until January 2016 for randomized controlled trials that compared second- or third-line therapy. We included 28 studies with 4810 patients. Second-line, single-agent taxane\/irinotecan showed increased survival compared to best supportive care (BSC) (hazard ratio 0.65, 95\u00a0% confidence interval 0.53-0.79). Median survival gain ranged from 1.4 to 2.7\u00a0months among individual studies. Taxane- and irinotecan-based regimens showed equal survival benefit. Doublet chemotherapy taxane\/irinotecan plus platinum and fluoropyrimidine was not different in survival, but showed increased toxicity vs. taxane\/irinotecan monotherapy. Compared to BSC, second-line ramucirumab and second- or third-line everolimus and regorafenib showed limited median survival gain ranging from 1.1 to 1.4\u00a0months, and progression-free survival gain, ranging from 0.3 to 1.6\u00a0months. Third- or later-line apatinib showed increased survival benefit over BSC (HR 0.50, 0.32-0.79). Median survival gain ranged from 1.8 to 2.3\u00a0months. Compared to taxane-alone, survival was superior for second-line ramucirumab plus taxane (HR 0.81, 0.68-0.96), and olaparib plus taxane (HR 0.56, 0.35-0.87), with median survival gains of 2.2 and 4.8\u00a0months respectively. Targeted agents, either in monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy showed increased toxicity compared to BSC and chemotherapy-alone. This review indicates that, given the survival benefit in a phase III study setting, ramucirumab plus taxane is the preferred second-line treatment. Taxane or irinotecan monotherapy are alternatives, although the absolute survival benefit was limited. In third-line setting, apatinib monotherapy is preferred.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000dfa","authors":["Ter Veer, Emil","Haj Mohammad, Nadia","van Valkenhoef, Gert","Ngai, Lok Lam","Mali, Rosa M A","van Oijen, Martijn G H","van Laarhoven, Hanneke W M","Emil ter Veer","Nadia Haj Mohammad","Gert van Valkenhoef","Lok Lam Ngai","Rosa M.
