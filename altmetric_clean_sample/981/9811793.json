H. pylori infection induces chronic inflammation, causes DNA damage and aberrant methylation of genes and these pathways are involved in H. pylori-related gastric carcinogenesis. Polymorphisms of the genes involved in these pathways could alter susceptibility to gastric cancer. In this mini review, we focused on the role of polymorphisms in these genes on the susceptibility to gastric cancer, with a particular emphasis on their possible interactions with H. pylori infection. We found that many studies on this theme did not simultaneously report H. pylori infection and the interactions remained inconclusive.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008df2","authors":["Jia,
