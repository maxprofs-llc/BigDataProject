The mechanisms still remain unclear and treatments are not sufficient to reduce risk in majority of patients. Inflammatory mechanisms may provide an important mechanism linking hypertension and cardiovascular risk. We aim to review newly identified immune and inflammatory mechanisms of hypertension with focus on their potential therapeutic impact.\nIn addition to the established role of the vasculature, kidneys and central nervous system in pathogenesis of hypertension, low-grade inflammation contributes to this disorder as indicated by experimental models and GWAS studies pointing to SH2B3 immune gene as top key driver of hypertension. Immune responses in hypertension are greatly driven by neoantigens generated by oxidative stress and modulated by chemokines such as RANTES, IP-10 and microRNAs including miR-21 and miR-155 with other molecules under investigation. Cells of both innate and adoptive immune system infiltrate vasculature and kidneys, affecting their function by releasing pro-inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species.\nImmune and inflammatory mechanisms of hypertension provide a link between high blood pressure and increased cardiovascular risk, and reduction of blood pressure without attention to these underlying mechanisms is not sufficient to reduce risk.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000704f","authors":["Ryszard Nosalski","Eilidh McGinnigle","Mateusz Siedlinski","Tomasz J.
