We aimed to examine and compare the predictive capacity of 4 simple scoring systems (MADIT-II, FADES, PACE and SHOCKED) for predicting mortality after defibrillator implantation for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in a Mediterranean country.\nA multicenter retrospective study was performed in 15 Spanish hospitals. Consecutive patients referred for defibrillator implantation between January 2010 and December 2011 were included.\nA total of 916 patients with ischemic and nonischemic heart disease were included (mean age, 62 \u00b1 11 years, 81.4% male). Over 33.4 \u00b1 12.9 months, 113 (12.3%) patients died (cardiovascular origin in 86 [9.4%] patients). At 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, mortality rates were 4.5%, 7.6%, 10.8%, and 12.3% respectively. All the risk scores showed a stepwise increase in the risk of death throughout the scoring system of each of the scores and all 4 scores identified patients at greater risk of mortality. The scores were significantly associated with all-cause mortality throughout the follow-up period. PACE displayed the lowest c-index value regardless of whether the population had heart disease of ischemic (c-statistic = 0.61) or nonischemic origin (c-statistic = 0.61), whereas MADIT-II (c-statistic = 0.67 and 0.65 in ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy, respectively), SHOCKED (c-statistic = 0.68 and 0.66, respectively), and FADES (c-statistic = 0.66 and 0.60) provided similar c-statistic values (P \u2265 .09).\nIn this nontrial-based cohort of Mediterranean patients, the 4 evaluated risk scores showed a significant stepwise increase in the risk of death. Among the currently available risk scores, MADIT-II, FADES, and SHOCKED provide slightly better performance than PACE.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6363cf058f6100087c0","authors":["Rodr\u00edguez-Ma\u00f1ero, Mois\u00e9s","Abu Assi, Emad","S\u00e1nchez-G\u00f3mez, Juan Miguel","Fern\u00e1ndez-Armenta, Juan","D\u00edaz-Infante, Ernesto","Garc\u00eda-Bolao, Ignacio","Benezet-Mazuecos, Juan","Andr\u00e9s Lahuerta, Ana","Exp\u00f3sito-Garc\u00eda, V\u00edctor","Bertomeu-Gonz\u00e1lez, Vicente","Arce-Le\u00f3n, \u00c1lvaro","Barrio-L\u00f3pez, Mar\u00eda Teresa","Peinado, Rafael","Mart\u00ednez-Sande, Luis","Arias, Miguel A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.rec.2016.03.027","first_seen_on":"2016-08-10T10:30:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1885-5857","18855857"],"issue":"11","journal":"Revista Espanola De Cardiologia","last_mentioned_on":1475216419,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27491594","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27491594\/?i=4&from=valdecilla","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27491594"],"pmid":"27491594","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Comparative Evaluation of Four Risk Scores for Predicting Mortality in Patients With Implantable Cardioverter-defibrillator for Primary Prevention","type":"article","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-evaluation-four-risk-scores-predicting-mortality-patients-implantable-cardioverterdefibr-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":4018016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4248340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260031,"mean":12.011215398223,"rank":119009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":132725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260031,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":519,"mean":2.6561081081081,"rank":142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":519,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.4315789473684,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2},"by_discipline":{"Environmental Science":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BiblioCHT\/statuses\/763321604512382976","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10371600],"posted_on":"2016-08-10T10:30:27+00:00","author":{"name":"Biblioteca CHT","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/746469042576310272\/A8SftwuT_normal.jpg","description":"Bibliotecaria del Complejo Hospitalario de Toledo desde ... \u00a1ufff!.
