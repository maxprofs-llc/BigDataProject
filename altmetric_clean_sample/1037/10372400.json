Paradoxically, in non-Ras transformed medulloblastoma brain tumors, we have shown that expression and activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkA over-activates macropinocytosis resulting in the catastrophic disintegration of the cell membrane resulting in tumor cell death. The molecular basis of this uncontrolled form of macropinocytosis has not been previously understood. Here, we demonstrate that the over-activation of macropinocytosis is caused by the simultaneous activation of two TrkA-mediated pathways: (1) inhibition of RhoB via phosphorylation at Ser(185) by casein kinase 1, which relieves actin stress fibers, and (2) FRS2-scaffolded Src and H-Ras activation of RhoA which stimulates actin re-organization and the formation of lamellopodia. Since catastrophic macropinocytosis results in brain tumor cell death, improved understanding of the mechanisms involved will facilitate future efforts to re-program tumors, even those resistant apoptosis, to die.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310d","authors":["Li, Chunhui","MacDonald, James I S","Talebian, Asghar","Leuenberger, Jennifer","Seah, Claudia","Pasternak, Stephen H","Michnick, Stephen W","Meakin, Susan O","Chunhui Li","James I.
