Seventy-six participants were randomly assigned to four groups and saw different multimedia presentations suggesting that the subsequent exercise (moderate 30\u00a0min cycling) would result in more or less health benefits (induced expectations). Additionally, we assessed habitual expectations reflecting previous experience and beliefs regarding exercise benefits. Participants with more positive habitual expectations consistently demonstrated both greater psychological benefits (more enjoyment, mood increase, and anxiety reduction) and greater increase of alpha-2 power, assessed with electroencephalography. Manipulating participants' expectations also resulted in largely greater increases of alpha-2 power, but not in more psychological exercise benefits. On the physiological level, participants decreased their blood pressure after exercising, but this was independent of their expectations. These results indicate that habitual expectations in particular affect exercise-induced psychological and neurophysiological changes in a self-fulfilling manner.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc0","authors":["Hendrik Mothes","Christian Leukel","Han-Gue Jo","Harald Seelig","Stefan Schmidt","Reinhard Fuchs"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10865-016-9781-3","first_seen_on":"2016-08-10T13:35:35+00:00","issns":["1573-3521","0160-7715"],"journal":"Journal of Behavioral Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1506887646,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10865-016-9781-3","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10865-016-9781-3","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10865-016-9781-3","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10865-016-9781-3","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27506909","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10865-016-9781-3"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10865-016-9781-3.pdf","pmid":"27506909","pubdate":"2016-08-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"General Practice \/ Family Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"Expectations affect psychological and neurophysiological benefits even after a single bout of exercise","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s10865-016-9781-3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expectations-affect-psychological-neurophysiological-benefits-even-after-single-bout-exercise"},"altmetric_score":{"score":391.234,"score_history":{"1y":102.434,"6m":25.45,"3m":4.1,"1m":1,"1w":1,"6d":1,"5d":1,"4d":1,"3d":1,"2d":1,"1d":0,"at":391.234},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462593,"mean":7.1086032149407,"rank":14442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":8448183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462593,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260089,"mean":12.010507236012,"rank":1240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":258849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260089,"percentile":99},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":658,"mean":7.3391171993912,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":658,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":6.4003333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":77,"researcher":18,"practitioner":11,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":77,"Scientists":18,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":11}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
