The purpose of this study is to expand our understanding of the experience of losing weight through yoga. Methods. Semistructured interviews were qualitatively analyzed using a descriptive phenomenological approach. Results. Two distinct groups who had lost weight through yoga responded: those who were overweight and had repeatedly struggled in their attempts to lose weight (55%, n = 11) and those who were of normal weight and had lost weight unintentionally (45%, n = 9). Five themes emerged that differed slightly by group: shift toward healthy eating, impact of the yoga community\/yoga culture, physical changes, psychological changes, and the belief that the yoga weight loss experience was different than past weight loss experiences. Conclusions. These findings imply that yoga could offer diverse behavioral, physical, and psychosocial effects that may make it a useful tool for weight loss. Role modeling and social support provided by the yoga community may contribute to weight loss, particularly for individuals struggling to lose weight.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c64","authors":["Ross, A.","Ross, A","Brooks, A","Touchton-Leonard, K","Wallen, G"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/2914745","endpage":"11","first_seen_on":"2016-08-10T15:42:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1741-427X","1741-4288"],"journal":"Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)","last_mentioned_on":1486133421,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2016\/2914745\/","http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2016\/2914745\/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2016\/2914745\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27594890"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2016\/2914745.pdf","pmid":"27594890","pubdate":"2016-08-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","title":"A Different Weight Loss Experience: A Qualitative Study Exploring the Behavioral, Physical, and Psychosocial Changes Associated with Yoga That Promote Weight Loss","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/different-weight-loss-experience-qualitative-study-exploring-behavioral-physical-psychosocial-change"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":4,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155605,"mean":6.9067370031636,"rank":1770600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6327808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155605,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256943,"mean":11.973610417915,"rank":72370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":183795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256943,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4004,"mean":4.675888083937,"rank":747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4004,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127,"mean":2.4071428571429,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
