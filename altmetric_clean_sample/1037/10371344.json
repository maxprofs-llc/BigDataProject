Cohort 1 included CSF samples from subjects having an AD biomarker profile (n = 10) or a control biomarker profile (n = 31), while cohort 2 was a monocenter clinical study including patients with AD (n = 32), mild cognitive impairment (n = 13), other dementias (n = 15), as well as cognitively healthy controls (n = 20).\nUCH-L1 and P-tau231 were elevated in AD patients compared to controls in both cohorts. CSF levels of DJ-1 and NSE were unchanged in the AD group, whereas they were decreased in the group of other dementia compared to controls in the clinical study.\nOur main findings support that the UPS pathway may be impaired in AD, and UCH-L1 may serve as an additional CSF biomarker for AD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbfc","authors":["\u00d6hrfelt, Annika","Johansson, Per","Wallin, Anders","Andreasson, Ulf","Zetterberg, Henrik","Blennow, Kaj","Svensson, Johan","\u00d6hrfelt, A","Johansson, P","Wallin, A","Andreasson, U","Zetterberg, H","Blennow, K","Svensson, J"],"doi":"10.1159\/000447239","endpage":"294","first_seen_on":"2016-08-10T10:22:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-5464"],"issue":"2","journal":"Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders EXTRA","last_mentioned_on":1486038630,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27504117?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27504117","http:\/\/discovery.ucl.ac.uk\/1537844\/"],"pmid":"27504117","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"283","title":"Increased Cerebrospinal Fluid Levels of Ubiquitin Carboxyl-Terminal Hydrolase L1 in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.karger.com\/?doi=10.1159\/000447239","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-cerebrospinal-fluid-levels-ubiquitin-carboxylterminal-hydrolase-l1-patients-alzheimers-dis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11,"score_history":{"1y":11,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150076,"mean":6.9043957460448,"rank":744926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7395710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150076,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256928,"mean":11.972566020698,"rank":34855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":221713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256928,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154,"mean":6.092614379085,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":12.775,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1,"Chemistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Increased Cerebrospinal Fluid Levels of Ubiquitin Carboxyl-Terminal Hydrolase L1 in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=27596152065&p=1pl&v=1&x=cPIdIKCkSRRN_24Qw9JEQA","license":"public","citation_ids":[10371344],"posted_on":"2016-08-12T23:14:25+00:00","summary":"\u00d6hrfelt A, Johansson P, Wallin A, Andreasson U, Zetterberg H, Blennow K, Svensson J.","author":{"name":"Alzforum","url":"http:\/\/www.alzforum.org","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/355\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-04-08_at_12.16.09_1.png?1428491784"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/B_A_Benitez\/statuses\/763319465224261632","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10371344],"posted_on":"2016-08-10T10:21:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Bruno A.
