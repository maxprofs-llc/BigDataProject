Various additive manufacturing processes have been used to produce open regular cellular structures limited only by the resolution of the printer. These efforts have focused on printing explicitly designed cells or explicitly planning offsets between strands. Here we describe a technique for producing cellular structures implicitly by inducing viscous thread instability when extruding material. This process allows us to produce complex cellular structures at a scale that is finer than the native resolution of the printer. We demonstrate tunable effective elastic modulus and density that span two orders of magnitude. Fine grained cellular structures allow for fabrication of foams for use in a wide range of fields ranging from bioengineering, to robotics to food printing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Lipton, Jeffrey I","Lipson, Hod"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep29996","first_seen_on":"2016-08-10T12:11:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1470832001,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27503148"],"pmid":"27503148","pubdate":"2016-08-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mechanical engineering","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Soft materials","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"29996","subjects":["science"],"title":"3D Printing Variable Stiffness Foams Using Viscous Thread Instability","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/3d-printing-variable-stiffness-foams-using-viscous-thread-instability"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8192854,"mean":6.9262032168704,"rank":5928766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1972784,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8192854,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257284,"mean":11.984969593793,"rank":167353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":74616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257284,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34560,"mean":14.845463005295,"rank":23359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":9468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34560,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3334,"mean":16.590674467447,"rank":2240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3334,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
