Prior to and after intervention, the patients' vital signs were measured. For case group yoga exercises were performed three sessions a week for 12 weeks while control group performed no exercise. The data were gathered by questionnaire and analysed by descriptive and analytical statistics in SPSS.\nPrior to intervention, there was no significant difference in fatigue severity and pain between the two groups but the mean fatigue severity and pain in case group decreased compared to the control group after the intervention. Prior to intervention, there was no significant difference in mean physiological indices between the two groups but the mean physiological indices in case group decreased significantly after the intervention (p<0.05).\nYoga is likely to increase self-efficacy of MS patients through enhancing physical activity, increasing the strength of lower limbs and balance, and decreasing fatigue and pain, and finally to promote social functioning and to relieve stress and anxiety in these patients.","authors":["Hasanpour-Dehkordi, Ali","Jivad, Nahid","Solati, Kamal","Ali Hasanpour-Dehkordi","Nahid Jivad","Kamal Solati"],"doi":"10.7860\/jcdr\/2016\/18204.7916","first_seen_on":"2016-08-10T10:16:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2249-782X","2249782X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR","last_mentioned_on":1473981536,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27504387?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27504387\/?i=4&from=multiple%20sclerosis","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27504387","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4963747\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.7860\/JCDR\/2016\/18204.7916"],"pmid":"27504387","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"JCDR Research & Publications Private Limited","startpage":"VC01","title":"Effects of Yog a on Physiological Indices, Anxiety and Social Functioning in Multiple Sclerosis Patients: A Randomized Trial","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-yog-physiological-indices-anxiety-social-functioning-multiple-sclerosis-patients-randomized"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Ph.
