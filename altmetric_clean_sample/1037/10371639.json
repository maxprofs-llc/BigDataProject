To determine the calibration factor M (corresponding to the maximum possible BOLD signal increase), BOLD signal and CBF are measured in response to a gas breathing challenge (usually CO2 or O2). Here we describe an ASL dual-acquisition sequence that combines a background-suppressed 3D-GRASE readout with 2D multi-slice EPI. The concatenation of these two imaging sequences allowed separate optimization of the acquisition for CBF and BOLD data. The dual-acquisition sequence was validated by comparison to an ASL sequence with a dual-echo EPI readout, using a visual fMRI paradigm. Results showed a 3-fold increase in temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) of the ASL time-series data while BOLD tSNR was similar to that obtained with the dual-echo sequence. The longer TR of the proposed dual-acquisition sequence, however, resulted in slightly lower T-scores (by 30%) in the BOLD activation maps. Further, the potential of the dual-acquisition sequence for M-mapping on the basis of a hypercapnia gas breathing challenge and for quantification of CMRO2 changes in response to a motor activation task was assessed. In five subjects, an average gray matter M-value of 8.71\u00b11.03 and fractional changes of CMRO2 of 12.5\u00b15% were found. The new sequence remedies the deficiencies of prior combined BOLD-ASL acquisition strategies by substantially enhancing perfusion tSNR, which is essential for accurate BOLD calibration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003196","authors":["Fern\u00e1ndez-Seara, Mar\u00eda A","Rodgers, Zachary B","Englund, Erin K","Wehrli, Felix W"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuroimage.2016.08.007","endpage":"482","first_seen_on":"2016-08-10T10:34:02+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1095-9572","10538119"],"journal":"NeuroImage","last_mentioned_on":1478353800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27502047?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1053811916303858&_version=1&md5=a87e17a0cca1bf5caf0d6316ad66ce3e"],"pmid":"27502047","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"474","subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Calibrated bold fMRI with an optimized ASL-BOLD dual-acquisition sequence","type":"article","volume":"142","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/calibrated-bold-fmri-optimized-aslbold-dualacquisition-sequence"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.7,"score_history":{"1y":3.7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7651252,"mean":6.5763358914726,"rank":1683556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5952957,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7651252,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252827,"mean":11.741932277534,"rank":73309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":178714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252827,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5268,"mean":7.5316385038922,"rank":1998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5268,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197,"mean":6.7667857142857,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
