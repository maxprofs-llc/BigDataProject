Curcumin is a natural phenol compound that has various biological activities, such as anti-proliferative and apoptosis-accelerating impacts on tumor cells. Unfortunately, the therapeutical activities of Cur are severely hindered due to its extremely low bioavailability. In this study, a cooperative therapy of low concentration Cur combined with red united blue light irradiation was performed to inspect the synergistic effects on the apoptosis, proliferation and autophagy in human melanoma A375 cell. The results showed that red united blue light irradiation efficaciously synergized with Cur to trigger oxidative stress-mediated cell death, induce apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation. Meanwhile, Western blotting revealed that combined disposure induced the formation of autophagosomes. Conversely, inhibition of the autophagy enhanced apoptosis, obstructed cell cycle arrest and induced reversible proliferation arrest to senescence. These findings suggest that Cur combined with red united blue light irradiation could generate photochemo-preventive effects via enhancing apoptosis and triggering autophagy, and pharmacological inhibition of autophagy convert reversible arrested cells to senescence, therefore reducing the possibility that damaged cells might escape programmed death.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Niu, Tianhui","Tian, Yan","Mei, Zhusong","Guo, Guangjin"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep31383","first_seen_on":"2016-08-10T10:22:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1470824536,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27502897?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27502897","pubdate":"2016-08-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Spectrophotometry","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Melanoma","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Macroautophagy","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Apoptosis","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Cell proliferation","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"31383","subjects":["science"],"title":"Inhibition of Autophagy Enhances Curcumin United light irradiation-induced Oxidative Stress and Tumor Growth Suppression in Human Melanoma Cells","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-autophagy-enhances-curcumin-united-light-irradiationinduced-oxidative-stress-tumor-growth"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8192854,"mean":6.9262032168704,"rank":7089874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8192854,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257284,"mean":11.985087751619,"rank":217350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257284,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34560,"mean":14.845463005295,"rank":29027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34560,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3334,"mean":16.59097449745,"rank":2811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3334,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AutophagyPapers\/statuses\/763319548682436608","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10371358],"posted_on":"2016-08-10T10:22:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Autophagy Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/559405603697590273\/EoGNUIXe_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for #Autophagy papers.
