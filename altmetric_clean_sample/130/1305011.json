The ability to simultaneously and efficiently measure the steady-state mRNA abundance of thousands of transcripts from a given tissue source (that is, 'transcriptomics') has provided an unprecedented opportunity to gain a broader, genome-level 'picture' of complex and heterogeneous clinical syndromes such as sepsis. A trancriptomic approach to sepsis and septic shock is technically challenging on multiple levels, but nonetheless modest, tangible advances are being realized. These include a genome-level understanding of the complexity of sepsis and septic shock, identification of novel candidate pathways and targets for potential intervention, discovery of novel, candidate diagnostic and stratification biomarkers, and the ability to stratify patients into clinically relevant, expression-based subclasses. The challenges moving forward include robust validation studies, standardization of technical approaches, standardization and further development of analytical algorithms, and large-scale collaborations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000805","doi":"10.1186\/cc10537","first_seen_on":"2013-03-16T21:09:31+00:00","funders":["nigms","nhlbi"],"issns":["1364-8535"],"issue":"1","journal":"Critical Care","last_mentioned_on":1390016138,"links":["http:\/\/ccforum.com\/content\/16\/1\/204","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22316118"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ccforum.com\/content\/pdf\/cc10537.pdf","pmid":"22316118","pubdate":"2012-02-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Emergency Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Intensive \/ Critical Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"204","subjects":["criticalcare"],"title":"Clinical review: Sepsis and septic shock - the potential of gene arrays","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-review-sepsis-septic-shockthe-potential-gene-arrays"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":983450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3514576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89501,"mean":6.5082315530727,"rank":22576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":66667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89501,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2510,"mean":5.3675520127541,"rank":945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":1555,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2510,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":5.9778503401361,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
