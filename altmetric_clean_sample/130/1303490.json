Addition of stoichiometric quantities of amino-substituted enyne and diyne substrates to ((iPr(TB))PDI)Fe(N2)2 resulted in isolation of catalytically competent bis(imino)pyridine iron metallacycle intermediates. A combination of magnetochemistry, X-ray diffraction, and M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopic and computational studies established S = 1 iron compounds that are best described as intermediate-spin iron(III) (SFe = 3\/2) antiferromagnetically coupled to a chelate radical anion (SPDI = 1\/2). Catalytically competent bis(imino)pyridine iron diene and metallacycles relevant to the [2\u03c0 + 2\u03c0] cycloaddition were also isolated and structurally characterized. The combined magnetic, structural, spectroscopic, and computational data support an Fe(I)-Fe(III) catalytic cycle where the bis(imino)pyridine chelate remains in its one-electron reduced radical anion form. These studies revise a previous mechanistic proposal involving exclusively ferrous intermediates and highlight the importance of the redox-active bis(imino)pyridine chelate for enabling catalytic cyclization chemistry with iron.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Jordan M.
