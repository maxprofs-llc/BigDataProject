LipL32, a 32-kDa lipoprotein, is the most abundant protein on the outer membrane of Leptospira and has an atypical poly(Asp) motif ((161)DDDDDGDD(168)). The x-ray crystallographic structure of LipL32 revealed that the calcium-binding cluster of LipL32 includes several essential residues Asp(132), Thr(133), Asp(164), Asp(165), and Tyr(178). The goals of this study were to determine possible roles of the Ca(2+)-binding cluster for the interaction of LipL32 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in induced inflammatory responses of human kidney cells. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to individually mutate Ca(2+)-binding residues of LipL32 to Ala, and their effects subsequently were observed. These mutations abolished primarily the structural integrity of the calcium-binding cluster in LipL32. The binding assay and atomic force microscopy analysis further demonstrated the decreased binding capability of LipL32 mutants to TLR2. Inflammatory responses induced by LipL32 variants, as determined by TLR2 pathway intermediates hCXCL8\/IL-8, hCCL2\/MCP-1, hMMP7, and hTNF-\u03b1, were also lessened. In conclusion, the calcium-binding cluster of LipL32 plays essential roles in presumably sustaining LipL32 conformation for its proper association with TLR2 to elicit inflammatory responses in human renal cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Yueh-Yu Lo","Shen-Hsing Hsu","Yi-Ching Ko","Cheng-Chieh Hung","Ming-Yang Chang","Hsiang-Hao Hsu","Ming-Jeng Pan","Yen-Wei Chen","Ching-Hung Lee","Fan-Gang Tseng","Yuh-Ju Sun","Chih-Wei Yang","Rong-Long Pan"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m112.418699","first_seen_on":"2013-03-14T13:01:22+00:00","issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1363266233,"links":["http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/early\/2013\/03\/13\/jbc.M112.418699.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/early\/2013\/03\/13\/jbc.M112.418699.full.pdf","pmid":"23486465","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Essential calcium binding cluster of Leptospira LipL32 for inflammatory responses through the Toll-like receptor 2 pathway","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/essential-calciumbinding-cluster-leptospira-lipl32-protein-inflammatory-responses-through-tolllike-r"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2310221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1580826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89313,"mean":6.4568408724472,"rank":44240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":32372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89313,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30238,"mean":2.4954086714952,"rank":18926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":7112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30238,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":1.6602272727273,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
