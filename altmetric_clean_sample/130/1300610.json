Induction of heat shock proteins (HSP) represents an important adaptive response in muscle subjected to stress, and in several cell types including cardiac myocytes prostaglandins are important in induction of the HSP response. This study aimed to determine the influence of NSAIDs on the HSP response to eccentric exercise in human skeletal muscle. Healthy males performed 200 maximal eccentric contractions with each leg with intramuscular infusion of the NSAID indomethacin or placebo. Biopsies were obtained from m. vastus lateralis before and after (5, 28 hrs and 8 days) the exercise bout from both legs (NSAID vs unblocked leg) and analysed for expression of the HSPs HSP70, HSP27 and \u03b1B-crystallin (mRNA and protein). NSAID did not affect the mRNA expression of any of the HSPs. Compared to pre values, the mRNA expression of all HSPs was increased; \u03b1B-crystallin, 3.6- and 5.4-fold; HSP70, 26- and 3.4-fold; and HSP27: 4.8- and 6.5-fold at 5 and 28 hrs post-exercise, respectively (all p < 0.008). Immunohistochemical stainings for \u03b1B-crystallin and HSP70 revealed increased staining in some samples but with no differences between legs. Changes in force-generating capacity correlated with both \u03b1B-crystallin and HSP70 mRNA and immunohistochemisty data. Increased expression of HSPs was observed on mRNA and protein level following eccentric exercise; however, this response was unaffected by local intramuscular infusion of NSAIDs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000733b","authors":["Mikkelsen UR","Paulsen G","Schjerling P","Helmark IC","Langberg H","Kj\u00e6r M","Heinemeier KM"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00421-013-2606-y","first_seen_on":"2013-03-14T09:01:04+00:00","issns":["1439-6319"],"issue":"","journal":"European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1365729737,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23467900\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23467900"],"pmid":"23467900","pubdate":"2013-03-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Occupational Medicine\/Industrial Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sports Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"The heat shock protein response following eccentric exercise in human skeletal muscle is unaffected by local NSAID infusion.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/heat-shock-protein-response-following-eccentric-exercise-human-skeletal-muscle-unaffected-local-nsai"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2122997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2225531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89312,"mean":6.456856624604,"rank":39427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":45842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89312,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1518,"mean":6.5699868160844,"rank":864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1518,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":16.903071428571,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
