With the rapid accumulation of information on the diversity of Symbiodinium, it is becoming increasingly difficult to compare newly acquired Symbiodinium data with existing data to detect patterns of host-symbiont specificity on broader spatial scales. The lack of a general consensus on the classification of Symbiodinium species coupled with the variety of different markers used to identify the genus Symbiodinium (ITS1, ITS2, LSU D1\/D2, chloroplast 23S rDNA and psbA minicircle) further complicate direct comparison.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cc3cf058f6100004b4","authors":["Tonk L","Bongaerts P","Sampayo EM","Hoegh-Guldberg O"],"doi":"10.1186\/1472-6785-13-7","first_seen_on":"2013-03-14T16:06:21+00:00","issns":["1472-6785",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Ecology","last_mentioned_on":1396307040,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6785\/13\/7\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1472-6785-13-7"],"pmid":"23497177","pubdate":"2013-03-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"7","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"SymbioGBR: a web-based database of Symbiodinium associated with cnidarian hosts on the Great Barrier Reef","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/symbiogbr-webbased-database-symbiodinium-associated-cnidarian-hosts-great-barrier-reef"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.266,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.266},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228730,"mean":5.9649848381607,"rank":707804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":5520910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228730,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98191,"mean":6.7319243303799,"rank":13571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":84620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98191,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204,"mean":13.422837438424,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":16.4372,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
