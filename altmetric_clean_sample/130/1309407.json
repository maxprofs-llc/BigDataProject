Survivors living in impoverished neighborhoods may suffer even greater impairment, but the mechanisms linking neighborhood poverty and individual outcomes are poorly understood. This study sought to identify mediators of the effect of neighborhood poverty on physical functioning using longitudinal data from a Missouri cancer registry-based sample of 909 female breast cancer survivors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dc8","authors":["Pruitt SL","McQueen A","Deshpande AD","Jeffe DB","Schootman M"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10552-012-0030-y","endpage":"1540","first_seen_on":"2013-03-19T13:09:10+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["0957-5243","1573-7225"],"issue":"9","journal":"Cancer Causes and Control","last_mentioned_on":1363698470,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22833236?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22833236","pubdate":"2012-07-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Epidemiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hematology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health\/Gesundheitswesen","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1529","subjects":["neoplasms","epidemiology"],"title":"Mediators of the effect of neighborhood poverty on physical functioning among breast cancer survivors: a longitudinal study.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mediators-effect-neighborhood-poverty-physical-functioning-among-breast-cancer-survivors-longitudina"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507953,"mean":5.1586375230457,"rank":2283406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1644827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507953,"percentile":36},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89795,"mean":6.6214396730295,"rank":43635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":34701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89795,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":801,"mean":4.7978725,"rank":444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":801,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":4.8006875,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
