Induction of apoptosis by CDDO-Me is associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibition of telomerase activity. In the present study, we investigated the role of ROS in inhibition of telomerase by CDDO-me. Treatment of MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cell lines with CDDO-Me induced the production of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anions and inhibited the telomerase activity. Pretreatment of cells with N-acetylcycsteine, a general purpose antioxidant or overexpression of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) or superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) blocked the telomerase inhibitory activity of CDDO-Me. Furthermore, blocking ROS generation also prevented the inhibition of hTERT gene expression, hTERT protein production and expression of a number of hTERT-regulatory proteins by CDDO-Me (e.g., c-Myc, Sp1, NF-\u03baB and p-Akt). Data also showed that Akt plays an important role in the activation of telomerase activity. Together, these data suggest that inhibition of telomerase activity by CDDO-Me is mediated through a ROS-dependent mechanism; however, more work is needed to fully understand the role of ROS in down-regulation of hTERT gene and hTERT-regulatory proteins by CDDO-Me.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Dorrah Deeb","Deeb D","Gao X","Liu Y","Varma NR","Arbab AS","Gautam SC"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules18033250","endpage":"3265","first_seen_on":"2013-03-18T12:04:09+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1420-3049",""],"issue":"3","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1363608172,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/18\/3\/3250"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/18\/3\/3250\/pdf","pmid":"23486104","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"3250","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Inhibition of Telomerase Activity by Oleanane Triterpenoid CDDO-Me in Pancreatic Cancer Cells is ROS-Dependent","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-telomerase-activity-oleanane-triterpenoid-cddome-pancreatic-cancer-cells-rosdependent"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2309972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1581486,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96200,"mean":6.3380995436544,"rank":46964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":35640,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96200,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1532,"mean":1.4652240365774,"rank":314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":1097,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1532,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.05,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
