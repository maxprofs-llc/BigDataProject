There are numerous methods to reconstruct the original shape of the target object from scans, but they are still dependent on the number of angles and iterations. To overcome the drawbacks of iterative reconstruction approaches like the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART), while the recovery is slightly impacted from a random noise (small amount of \u21132 norm error) and projection scans (small amount of \u21131 norm error) as well, we propose a medical image reconstruction methodology using the properties of sparse coding. It is a very powerful matrix factorization method which each pixel point is represented as a linear combination of a small number of basis vectors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088c9","authors":["Yoon, Gang-Joon"],"doi":"10.1155\/2013\/145198","first_seen_on":"2013-03-18T09:50:37+00:00","issns":[""],"journal":"The Scientific World Journal","last_mentioned_on":1364986800,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/tswj\/2013\/145198\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/tswj\/2013\/145198.pdf","pmid":"23576898","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Sparse-Coding-Based Computed Tomography Image Reconstruction","type":"article","volume":"2013","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sparsecodingbased-computed-tomography-image-reconstruction-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627694,"mean":4.9472740289804,"rank":254822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":3369603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627694,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92193,"mean":6.0996767398474,"rank":8439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":83672,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92193,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1125,"mean":1.8308558718861,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":1100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1125,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":4.4306,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
