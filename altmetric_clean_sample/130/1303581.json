We used a generalized linear mixed model to relate the probability of Bartonella infection to species, season, locality, habitat, sex, sexual condition, weight, and ectoparasite infestation. Overall, Bartonella infection prevalence among the small mammals was 34.0%. The probability of Bartonella infection varied significantly with species, sex, sexual condition, and some locality, but not with season, elevation, habitat type, animal weight, and ectoparasite infestation. In total, we found 18 unique Bartonella genotypes clustered into 5 clades, 1 clade exclusively Ethiopian, 2 clades clustered with genotypes from central and eastern Africa, and the remaining 2 clades clustered with genotypes and species from Africa and Asia. The close relatedness of several of our Bartonella genotypes obtained from the 3 dominant rodent species in Tigray with the pathogenic Bartonella elizabethae from Rattus spp. in Asia indicates a potential public health threat.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036f2","authors":[" Yonas   Meheretu "],"doi":"10.1089\/vbz.2012.1004","first_seen_on":"2013-03-15T15:32:27+00:00","issns":["1530-3667"],"journal":"Vector Borne & Zoonotic Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1363361486,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/vbz.2012.1004"],"pmid":"23421888","pubdate":"2013-02-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["epidemiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"Bartonella Prevalence and Genetic Diversity in Small Mammals from Ethiopia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bartonella-prevalence-genetic-diversity-small-mammals-ethiopia-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":3095166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":973256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89425,"mean":6.5172334049026,"rank":60432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":19504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89425,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":495,"mean":2.5238056680162,"rank":314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":495,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":2.43125,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
