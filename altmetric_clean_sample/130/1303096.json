In this work, we propose a photoacoustic and Doppler ultrasound method for imaging local blood oxygen flux of a single vessel. An imaging system for combined photoacoustic and high-frequency ultrasound microscopy is presented. This system uses a swept-scan 25-MHz ultrasound transducer with confocal dark-field laser illumination optics. A pulse-sequencer enables ultrasonic and laser pulses to be interlaced so that photoacoustic and Doppler ultrasound images are co-registered. Since the mean flow speed can be measured by color Doppler ultrasound, the vessel cross-sectional area can be measured by power Doppler or structural photoacoustic imaging, and multi-wavelength photoacoustic methods can be used to estimate oxygen saturation (sO(2)) and total concentration of haemoglobin (C(Hb)), all of the parameters necessary for oxygen flux estimation can be provided. The accuracy of the flow speed and sO(2) estimation has been investigated. In vitro sheep blood phantom experiments have been performed at different sO(2) levels and mean flow speeds. Blood oxygen flux has been estimated, and the uncertainty of the measurement has been quantified.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012JBO....17c6012J","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd0","authors":["Jiang Y","Forbrich A","Harrison T","Zemp RJ"],"doi":"10.1117\/1.jbo.17.3.036012","first_seen_on":"2013-03-15T10:32:41+00:00","issns":["1083-3668"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Biomedical Optics","last_mentioned_on":1363343499,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/22502570\/"],"pmid":"22502570","pubdate":"2012-04-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Optical Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering","ophthalmology"],"title":"Blood oxygen flux estimation with a combined photoacoustic and high-frequency ultrasound microscopy system: a phantom study.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blood-oxygen-flux-estimation-combined-photoacoustic-highfrequency-ultrasound-microscopy-system-phant"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622349,"mean":4.9309966560279,"rank":2016270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":928838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622349,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85522,"mean":6.2767562353106,"rank":43435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":27022,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85522,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":323,"mean":2.8274782608696,"rank":128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":323,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.8071428571429,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
