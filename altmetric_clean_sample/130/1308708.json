Despite considerable evolutionary and physiological differences, these two species appear to use nearly identical growth strategies under a wide range of nutrient limitation. \u00b7 Using a variety of physiological measurements, we find that, for both species and across all growth rates, 75% of the gross photosynthetic electron flow is invested in carbon fixation and only 30% is retained as net carbon accumulation. A majority of gross photosynthesis (70%) is ultimately used as reductant for biosynthetic pathways and for the generation of ATP. \u00b7 In both species, newly formed carbon products exhibit much shorter half-lives at slow growth rates than at fast growth rates. We show that this growth rate dependence is a result of increased polysaccharide storage during the S phase of the cell cycle. \u00b7 We present a model of carbon utilization that incorporates this growth rate-dependent carbon allocation and accurately captures (r(2) = 0.94) the observed time-resolved carbon retention. Together, our findings suggest a common photosynthetic optimization strategy in evolutionarily distinct phytoplankton species and contribute towards a systems-level understanding of carbon flow in photoautotrophs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50e3cf058f6100031cc","authors":["Halsey, Kimberly H.","O'Malley, Robert T.","Graff, Jason R.","Milligan, Allen J.","Behrenfeld, Michael J."],"doi":"10.1111\/nph.12209","endpage":"1038","first_seen_on":"2013-03-19T08:06:54+00:00","issns":["1469-8137","0028-646X"],"issue":"4","journal":"New Phytologist","last_mentioned_on":1363680329,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nph.12209\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nph.12209\/pdf","pmid":"23452244","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1030","subjects":["botany"],"title":"A common partitioning strategy for photosynthetic products in evolutionarily distinct phytoplankton species","type":"article","volume":"198","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/common-partitioning-strategy-photosynthetic-products-evolutionarily-distinct-phytoplankton-species"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6666109,"mean":6.1602089729097,"rank":5689826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6666109,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112625,"mean":6.3544336375907,"rank":88993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112625,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2992,"mean":7.1704974924774,"rank":2898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2992,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":7.99,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
