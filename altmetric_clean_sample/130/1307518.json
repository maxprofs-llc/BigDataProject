Associated with the conformation changing, the symmetry alters between nonpolar and polar space groups.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Yan-Yan Yin","Yan-Li Zhao","Jian-Gong Ma","Xiao-Chang Cao","Peng Cheng"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic302711b","first_seen_on":"2013-03-18T17:05:25+00:00","issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1363626246,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic302711b"],"pmid":"23506228","pubdate":"2013-03-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"130318123828001","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis and Chirality Control of Bulk Crystals and Nanocrystals: From a Right-Handed Nonpolar Chain to a Left-Handed Polar Chain","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-chirality-control-bulk-crystals-nanocrystals-righthanded-nonpolar-chain-lefthanded-polar-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3542089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":135968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96198,"mean":6.3262362443736,"rank":74970,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96198,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5999,"mean":1.516711237079,"rank":4922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5999,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":443,"mean":1.3997737556561,"rank":401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":443,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
