Instead of methodology development, here we simply overcome the limitation by optimizing megaprimer PCR conditions via orthogonal array design of the four PCR components in three levels of each: template, primer, Mg(2+) , and dNTPs. For this, only nine PCRs need to be performed. The strategy (termed as OptiMega) was not only successfully applied for the construction of one multiple-site saturation mutagenesis library of halohydrin dehalogenase HheC, which failed to be constructed previously using the standard QuikChange\u2122 protocol, but also expanded the construction of two high-quality random mutagenesis libraries of HheA and HheC. Most importantly, OptiMega offers a quick and simple way of constructing random mutagenesis libraries by eliminating the ligation step. Our results demonstrated that the OptiMega strategy could greatly strengthen the potential of megaprimer PCR mutagenesis for library construction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023fb","authors":["Tang, Lixia","Zheng, Kai","Liu, Yu","Zheng, Huayu","Wang, Hu","Song, Chunlei","Zhou, Hong"],"doi":"10.1002\/bab.1065","endpage":"195","first_seen_on":"2013-03-15T18:18:22+00:00","issns":["1470-8744","0885-4513"],"issue":"2","journal":"Biotechnology & Applied Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1363371436,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bab.1065\/abstract;jsessionid=7F37B20D5A75DDB21AAF0A09FC63554B.d01t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bab.1065\/pdf","pmid":"23586485","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"190","subjects":["biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"Exploring the potential of megaprimer PCR in conjunction with orthogonal array design for mutagenesis library construction","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exploring-potential-megaprimer-pcr-conjunction-orthogonal-array-design-mutagenesis-library-construct"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6287087,"mean":5.981417171326,"rank":4647403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":940787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6287087,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98712,"mean":6.7832498910962,"rank":65891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":18760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98712,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173,"mean":1.1883372093023,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
