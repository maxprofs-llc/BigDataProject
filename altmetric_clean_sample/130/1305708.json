Oxidation of the drug was effected in a single reversible, diffusion-controlled step within the pH range 2.0-4.0, a second oxidation process was produced above pH 4.0. Using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), the drug yielded a well-defined voltammetric response in Britton-Robinson buffer, pH 3.0 at 0.500 V (vs. Ag\/AgCl) on carbon paste electrode. This process could be used to determine etoposide concentrations in the range 2.5 x 10(-7) to 2.5 x 10(-5) M with a detection limit of 1.0 x 10(-7) M. The method was successfully applied to the determination of the drug in spiked human serum.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e40","authors":["Radi AE","Abd-Elghany N","Wahdan T"],"first_seen_on":"2013-03-17T14:35:14+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"9","journal":"Chemical and Pharmaceutical Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1363523583,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17827766"],"pmid":"17827766","pubdate":"2007-09-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","pharmacology"],"title":"Electrochemical study of the antineoplastic agent etoposide at carbon paste electrode and its determination in spiked human serum by differential pulse voltammetry.","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electrochemical-study-antineoplastic-agent-etoposide-carbon-paste-electrode-determination-spiked-hum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629283,"mean":4.9355109985986,"rank":2901334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77824,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629283,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92327,"mean":6.0792192231875,"rank":70590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92327,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":351,"mean":1.9198571428571,"rank":250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":351,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.3375,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Electrochemical study of the antineo...
