Recent studies have suggested that proteins involved in DNA transactions are also required for whole-chromosome stability. Here we demonstrate that the MRN (Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1) complex and CtIP are required for accurate chromosome segregation. Depletion of Mre11 or CtIP, antibody-mediated inhibition of Mre11, or small-molecule inhibition of MRN using mirin results in metaphase chromosome alignment defects in Xenopus egg extracts. Similarly, loss of MRN function adversely affects spindle assembly around DNA-coated beads in egg extracts. Inhibition of MRN function in mammalian cells triggers a metaphase delay and disrupts the RCC1-dependent RanGTP gradient. Addition of the Mre11 inhibitor mirin to egg extracts and mammalian cells reduces RCC1 association with mitotic chromosomes. Thus, the MRN-CtIP pathway contributes to Ran-dependent mitotic spindle assembly by modulating RCC1 chromosome association.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ba","authors":["Lorene Rozier","Yige Guo","Shaun Peterson","Mai Sato","Richard Baer","Jean Gautier","Yinghui Mao","Rozier L","Guo Y","Peterson S","Sato M","Baer R","Gautier J","Mao Y"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.molcel.2013.01.023","endpage":"1107","first_seen_on":"2013-03-14T01:56:53+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1097-2765","10972765"],"issue":"6","journal":"Molecular Cell","last_mentioned_on":1363226161,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1097276513000877"],"pmid":"23434370","pubdate":"2013-02-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cell Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1097","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"The MRN-CtIP Pathway Is Required for Metaphase Chromosome Alignment","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mrnctip-pathway-required-metaphase-chromosome-alignment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3078944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":958726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89312,"mean":6.4567424169476,"rank":60163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":19198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89312,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3351,"mean":4.4690513432836,"rank":2759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3351,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":3.9925818181818,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
