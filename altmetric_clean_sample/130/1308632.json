These two dairy products were chosen for the study because they are highly consumed in different cultures. Moreover, the microorganisms present in the fermentation processes are different. While the bacteria Lactobacillus is the one responsible for yogurt fermentation, a partnership between bacteria and the yeast Saccharomyces causes kefir fermentation. A comparative study has been carried out by fermenting Se(IV) enriched milk in the presence of both types of microorganisms, where the concentration range studied was from 0.5 to 20 microg g (-1). Enzymatic extraction enabled selenium speciation profiles, obtained by anionic exchange and ion-pairing reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (IP-RP-HPLC) with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) detection. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) applied to the enriched samples showed segregated Se (0), at added concentrations higher than 5 microg g (-1). The main Se species formed depended on the type of microorganism involved in the fermentation process, SeCys 2 and MeSeCys being the main species generated in yogurt and SeMet in kefir. The results obtained are different for both kinds of samples. Lactic fermentation for yogurt produced an increment in selenocystine (SeCys 2) and Se-methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys), while fermentation to produce kefir also incremented the selenomethionine (SeMet) concentration. The Se species are stable for at least 10 and 15 days for kefir and yogurt, respectively. After this period, selenocystine concentration decreased, and the concentration of Se-methylselenocysteine was found to significantly increase.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006625","authors":["A.
