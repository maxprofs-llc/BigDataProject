We examined baseline patient characteristics and initial treatment patterns. We then assessed changes in the DMARD regimen over the 12-month period after the 1(st) DMARD initiation date. Poisson regression estimated age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates of treatment changes in each calendar year.\nWe identified 9,222 PsA patients who initiated DMARDs (42.8% biologic and 57.2% conventional synthetic). Biologic DMARD (bDMARD) initiators were younger than conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) initiators (mean age\u00b1sd: 48\u00b113 vs. 52\u00b114 years) and had generally fewer comorbidities, but a higher proportion of bDMARD initiators received non-systemic treatments for psoriasis at baseline. Methotrexate was the most frequently used DMARD, constituting 80.6% of csDMARD initiation. Etanercept (49.1%) was the most commonly prescribed bDMARD followed by adalimumab (34.4%). During the 12-month followup after the 1(st) DMARD initiation, 20.1% bDMARD and 31.1% csDMARD initiators had their initial DMARD regimen modified, with an increasing trend in treatment modifications over the 11-year study period (p=0.03). Overall, 5.3% of patients had treatment discontinuation, but the rates decreased over time (p<0.001).\nIn this large cohort of PsA patients initiated on DMARDs, over 40% were treated with a bDMARD. We found an increasing trend in treatment modification after the initial DMARD use and a decreasing trend in complete DMARD discontinuation over the past decade.
