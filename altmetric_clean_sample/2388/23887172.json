Different types of visual stimuli are needed for evaluating different functionalities of the infants' visual system. Selecting appropriate visual stimuli is an important issue in evaluating visual cortical functions in infants. Properties of stimulation influence responses of visual system and must be adjusted according to the age and specific function which is going to be investigated. In this review, the most commonly used stimuli to elicit visual evoked potentials (VEPs) are evaluated and characteristics of VEPs extracted by these stimulations are studied. Furthermore, various studies investigating different functionalities such as selectivity for orientation and directional motion are presented. Valuable results regarding emerging and maturation times of different functions and normative data for clinical diagnosis are provided by these studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002425","authors":["Daneshvarfard, Farveh","Maarefi, Nasrin","Abrishami Moghaddam, Hamid","Wallois, Fabrice"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.braindev.2017.07.010","first_seen_on":"2017-08-16T03:28:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0387-7604","1872-7131"],"journal":"Brain & Development","last_mentioned_on":1502854098,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28803681?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28803681","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","pediatrics"],"title":"A survey on stimuli for visual cortical function assessment in infants","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":6064275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2021769,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162656,"mean":12.929103120101,"rank":106267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":46546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162656,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":642,"mean":2.2273822152886,"rank":389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":642,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.5038461538462,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"VE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PedNeurBriefs\/statuses\/897661200380678144","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23887172],"posted_on":"2017-08-16T03:28:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Ped Neurology Briefs","url":"http:\/\/www.pediatricneurologybriefs.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/763925960097800192\/QpZJcQcD_normal.jpg","description":"Pediatric Neurology Briefs (PNB) is the leading journal review focusing on child neurology since 1987. #OpenAccess on #PubMed & #PubMedCentral.","id_on_source":"PedNeurBriefs","tweeter_id":"759957720","geo":{"lt":41.85003,"ln":-87.65005,"country":"US"},"followers":2042},"tweet_id":"897661200380678144"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/neuropediat\/statuses\/897661268508770304","license":"gnip","rt":["PedNeurBriefs"],"citation_ids":[23887172],"posted_on":"2017-08-16T03:28:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Maria Laura.","url":"http:\/\/www.neuropediat.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/880460278185459713\/wwljw_bV_normal.jpg","description":"Pediatra\/Neur\u00f3logo Infantil.
