The catalytic performance of Janus-type catalysts both in homogeneous and interfacial reaction systems was systematically investigated using the reduction of nitro-compound as model reaction. The results showed that Janus-type catalysts have excellent catalytic activity in homogeneous reaction system and they are easy to recycle. Further, the Janus-type catalysts exhibited more efficient catalytic activity at emulsion interface than that of oil-water biphasic interface due to the exposed Au nanoparticles on snowman-like Janus particles offer high accessibility to reactants.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d15","authors":["Yijiang Liu","Jiankang Hu","Xiaotian Yu","Xinyu Xu","Yong Gao","Huaming Li","Fuxin Liang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jcis.2016.11.053","endpage":"364","first_seen_on":"2016-12-01T11:11:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00219797","1095-7103"],"journal":"Journal of Colloid & Interface Science","last_mentioned_on":1480590695,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0021979716309304&_version=1&md5=947c3267276054bcdb2d3994bd86af05"],"pmid":"27914334","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"357","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Preparation of Janus-type catalysts and their catalytic performance at emulsion interface","type":"article","volume":"490","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preparation-janustype-catalysts-catalytic-performance-emulsion-interface"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7831397,"mean":6.6382928244153,"rank":5939845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1048291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7831397,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251056,"mean":12.181486558722,"rank":173865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":47260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251056,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":809,"mean":2.0989084158416,"rank":452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":809,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":0.73815789473684,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
