Drawing on a series of original interviews with women it shows how running reflects anxieties about health and the unruly body and how running practices are firmly linked to ideas about body size and shape and to the 'ghosts' of potential, future illness. The paper then explores the ways in which running practices are shaped by attitudes to technology and by the relationship between nature, environment and the body.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029b7","authors":["Jo Little","Little, Jo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.healthplace.2016.11.011","first_seen_on":"2016-12-01T12:28:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["13538292","1873-2054"],"journal":"Health & Place","last_mentioned_on":1501873620,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1353829216304476","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1353829216304476?platform=hootsuite"],"pmid":"27903417","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Geography","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","epidemiology"],"title":"Running, health and the disciplining of women's bodies: The influence of technology and nature","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1353829216304476","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/running-health-disciplining-womens-bodies-influence-technology-nature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":27.6,"score_history":{"1y":27.6,"6m":9,"3m":9,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":27.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":323007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":7997148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278205,"mean":11.940464242067,"rank":18862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":259314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278205,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":800,"mean":8.7217647058824,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":762,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":800,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":11.5044375,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":13,"researcher":6,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":13,"Scientists":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":2,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":8,"CA":1,"US":2},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SimonIanCook\/statuses\/804300984520441856","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14214275],"posted_on":"2016-12-01T12:27:52+00:00","author":{"name":"Simon Cook","url":"http:\/\/jographies.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/776056204208529408\/YWMUMBF7_normal.jpg","description":"Runner | Human Geographer @RHULGeography | Lecturer in Academic Skills Support @MyBCU. \n\nCurrently applying geographical perspectives to the #runcommute","id_on_source":"SimonIanCook","tweeter_id":"480845349","geo":{"lt":52.48142,"ln":-1.89983,"country":"GB"},"followers":5071},"tweet_id":"804300984520441856"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrSophiaH\/statuses\/804302132157575169","license":"gnip","rt":["SimonIanCook"],"citation_ids":[14214275],"posted_on":"2016-12-01T12:32:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Sophia H.","url":"https:\/\/eastanglia.academia.edu\/SophiaHatzisavvidou","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/560738362609639424\/ByxAtEbb_normal.jpeg","description":"Early Career Fellow at @Politics_UEA funded by @LeverhulmeTrust Rhetoric, Political Theory and Green.","id_on_source":"DrSophiaH","tweeter_id":"432261733","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":565},"tweet_id":"804302132157575169"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/katyleighk\/statuses\/804303964632207360","license":"gnip","rt":["SimonIanCook"],"citation_ids":[14214275],"posted_on":"2016-12-01T12:39:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Katy Kennedy","url":"https:\/\/katyleighkennedy.wordpress.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/452720861909221376\/Izb7tbVu_normal.jpeg","description":"Psychology PhD researcher at Surrey Uni: exercise and affect\/emotion.
