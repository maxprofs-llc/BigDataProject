Unfortunately, treatment options are still very limited and prognosis for advanced disease is poor. Immune surveillance plays a crucial role in a host's defence against tumour cells, and this is particular relevant for lung cancer due to it's high somatic mutational load, which increases the chances for the immune system to recognize cancer cells as 'non-self'. Novel immunotherapies are emerging as an effective treatment for this disease. In this review, we present the data on immune checkpoint inhibitors for NSCLC, describing their mechanism of action, data efficacy from recent clinical trials, and strategies to select patients more likely to benefit from these agents.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007068","authors":["Califano, Raffaele","Califano, Raffaele","Kerr, K","Morgan, Robert David","Russo, G","Garassino, M","Morgillo, F","Rossi, A"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11912-016-0544-7","first_seen_on":"2016-12-01T13:40:52+00:00","handle":"10541\/619946","handles":["10541\/619946"],"issns":["1534-6269"],"issue":"9","journal":"Current Oncology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1480609828,"links":["https:\/\/christie.openrepository.com\/christie\/handle\/10541\/619946?utm_content=buffera1d91&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"27484062","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Immune Checkpoint Blockade: A New Era for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immune-checkpoint-blockade-new-era-nonsmall-cell-lung-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7831397,"mean":6.6382928244153,"rank":4100781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2181992,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7831397,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251057,"mean":12.181401193359,"rank":137939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":89314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251057,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238,"mean":4.7144219409283,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":83.375,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
