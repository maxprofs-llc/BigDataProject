SROC curve analysis was performed for meta-analysis and diagnostic accuracy was summarized.\nPooled sensitivity was 96% (94-98%) for INH, 97% (95-98%) for RIF, 92% (87-96%) for EMB and 92% (88-95%) for STR. Pooled specificity for INH, RIF, EMB and STR was 96% (95-98%), 99% (98-99%), 86% (81-89%) and 90% (87-93%), respectively. Susceptibility testing results had been obtained in 8-9days.\nIn conclusion, REMA seems to be a reliable test for the determination of multi-drug resistant (MDR) isolates in laboratories with limited resources. However, few studies for STR and EMB have been found, and cost-effectiveness studies need to be determined to recommend its widespread use.","authors":["Coban, Ahmet Yilmaz","Deveci, Aydin","Sunter, Ahmet Tevfik","Palomino, Juan Carlos","Martin, Anandi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijmyco.2014.09.002","first_seen_on":"2016-01-21T11:35:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2212-554X"],"issue":"4","journal":"International journal of mycobacteriology","last_mentioned_on":1453376075,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26786621?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26786621","pubdate":"2016-01-21T22:01:17+00:00","title":"Resazurin microtiter assay for isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin resistance detection in Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Updated meta-analysis.","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resazurin-microtiter-assay-isoniazid-rifampicin-ethambutol-streptomycin-resistance-detection-mycobac"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
