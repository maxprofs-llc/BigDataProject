In the present study, we found that the expression level of miR-143 is significantly reduced in clinical ESCC tissues compared with normal tissues and is correlated with lymph node metastasis (LNM), invasion and TNM stage groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis shows that miR-143 expression predicts a favorable outcome for ESCC patients. Functional experiments show that overexpression of miR-143 inhibits cell proliferation, blocks the G1\/S phase transition, and suppresses cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Dual luciferase assays reveal that STAT3 is a direct target gene of miR-143. Moreover, the restored expression of STAT3 protein in miR-143-overexpressing cells attenuated the suppressive effects of miR-143 on ESCC cells. Further studies verified that miR-143 repressed cell cycle and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling pathways by targeting STAT3, resulting in suppressing ESCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. We are the first to report the interaction between miR-143 and STAT3 in ESCC and in this study provide new insights into the role of miR-143 in the development of ESCC, and also implicate the potential application of miR-143 in cancer therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000249e","authors":["Jia Liu","Yu Mao","Dakai Zhang","Shengnan Hao","Zicheng Zhang","Zhenjiang Li","Baosheng Li","Liu, Jia","Mao, Yu","Zhang, Dakai","Hao, Shengnan","Zhang, Zicheng","Li, Zhenjiang","Li, Baosheng"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.canlet.2016.01.023","first_seen_on":"2016-01-22T02:19:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0304-3835","1872-7980","03043835"],"journal":"Cancer Letters","last_mentioned_on":1467932660,"links":["http:\/\/www.cancerletters.info\/article\/S0304-3835(16)00035-5\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26806810?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26806810?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cancerletters.info\/article\/S0304383516000355\/pdf","pmid":"26806810","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"MiR-143 inhibits tumor cell proliferation and invasion by targeting STAT3 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir143-inhibits-tumor-cell-proliferation-invasion-targeting-stat3-esophageal-squamous-cell-carcinoma-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019832,"mean":6.784478957969,"rank":6083770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1079297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019832,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":329645,"mean":9.415227239082,"rank":228967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":52385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":329645,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1880,"mean":3.3654060670569,"rank":1248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1880,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":1.2410327868852,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
