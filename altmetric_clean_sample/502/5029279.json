The molecular signaling cascade underlying this event remains obscure.\nThrough Ca(2+) imaging in acute embryonic cortical slices, we tested if radially migrating cortical excitatory neurons that already bore primitive axons were sensitive to Wnt5a. While Wnt5a only evoked brief Ca(2+) transients in immature neurons present in the intermediate zone\u00a0(IZ), Wnt5a-induced Ca(2+) oscillations were sustained in neurons that migrated out to the cortical plate\u00a0(CP). We wondered whether this early Wnt5a-Ca(2+) signaling during neuronal polarization has a morphogenetic consequence. During transition from round to polarized shape, Wnt5a administration to immature cultured cortical neurons specifically promoted axonal, but not dendritic, outgrowth. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the CaMKK-CaMKI\u03b1 pathway abolished Wnt5a-induced axonal elongation, and rescue of CaMKI\u03b1 in CaMKI\u03b1-knockdown neurons restored Wnt5a-mediated axon outgrowth.\nThis study suggests that Wnt5a activates Ca(2+) signaling during a neuronal morphogenetic time window when axon outgrowth is critically facilitated. Furthermore, the CaMKK-CaMKI\u03b1 cascade is required for the axonal growth effect of Wnt5a during neuronal polarization.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000872","authors":["Shin-ichiro Horigane","Shin-ichiro Horigane","Natsumi Ageta-Ishihara","Satoshi Kamijo","Hajime Fujii","Michiko Okamura","Makoto Kinoshita","Sayaka Takemoto-Kimura","Haruhiko Bito"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13041-016-0189-3","first_seen_on":"2016-01-23T05:09:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1756-6606"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Brain","last_mentioned_on":1453525750,"links":["http:\/\/molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13041-016-0189-3"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13041-016-0189-3?site=http:\/\/molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC4715351","pmid":"26772170","pubdate":"2016-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychopharmacology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["molecularbiology","brain"],"title":"Facilitation of axon outgrowth via a Wnt5a-CaMKK-CaMKI\u03b1 pathway during neuronal polarization","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/facilitation-axon-outgrowth-via-wnt5acamkkcamki%CE%B1-pathway-during-neuronal-polarization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7012411,"mean":6.2597681384832,"rank":5244179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":990571,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7012411,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":317437,"mean":9.2054161468766,"rank":218216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":56872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":317437,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":404,"mean":3.8485806451613,"rank":312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":404,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":6.3452592592593,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
