We sought to identify the underlying genetic mutations in a cohort of fourteen Indian autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) families and 100 Indian sporadic RP cases. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on the probands of the arRP families and sporadic RP patients, and direct Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the causal mutations identified by WES. We found that the mutations of EYS are likely pathogenic mutations in two arRP families and eight sporadic patients. Specifically, we found a novel pair of compound heterozygous mutations and a novel homozygous mutation in two separate arRP families, and found two novel heterozygous mutations in two sporadic RP patients, whereas we found six novel homozygous mutations in six sporadic RP patients. Of these, one was a frameshift mutation, two were stop-gain mutations, one was a splicing mutation, and the others were missense mutations. In conclusion, our findings expand the spectrum of EYS mutations in RP in the Indian population and provide further support for the role of EYS in the pathogenesis and clinical diagnosis of RP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Di, Yanan","Huang, Lulin","Sundaresan, Periasamy","Li, Shujin","Kim, Ramasamy","Ballav Saikia, Bibhuti","Qu, Chao","Zhu, Xiong","Zhou, Yu","Jiang, Zhilin","Zhang, Lin","Lin, Ying","Zhang, Dingding","Li, Yuanfen","Zhang, Houbin","Yin, Yibing","Lu, Fang","Zhu, Xianjun","Yang, Zhenglin"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep19432","first_seen_on":"2016-01-21T11:24:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1453376075,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26787102?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4726297","pmid":"26787102","pubdate":"2016-01-21T22:01:05+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical genetics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Hereditary eye disease","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Whole-exome Sequencing Analysis Identifies Mutations in the EYS Gene in Retinitis Pigmentosa in the Indian Population.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wholeexome-sequencing-analysis-identifies-mutations-eys-gene-retinitis-pigmentosa-indian-population"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7003089,"mean":6.2578197435162,"rank":3038357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":3806386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7003089,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316070,"mean":9.2007735589378,"rank":135961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":169658,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316070,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25284,"mean":14.432581892972,"rank":12461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":11932,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25284,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2844,"mean":16.576969398523,"rank":1368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":1371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2844,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
