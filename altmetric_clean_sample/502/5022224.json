Second-line salvage high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) have an established role in the management of refractory and relapsed HL, leading to long-lasting responses in approximately 50% of relapsed patients and a minority of refractory patients. Patients progressing after intensive treatments, such as auto-SCT, have a very poor outcome. Allogeneic SCT represents the only strategy with a curative potential for these patients; however, its role is controversial. Based on recent knowledge of HL pathology, biology, and immunology, antibody-drug conjugates targeting CD30, small molecule inhibitors of cell signaling, and antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoints are currently explored. This review will discuss the clinical results regarding auto-SCT and allo-SCT as well as the current role of emerging new treatment strategies.","altmetric_jid":"56e8230b2a83eea2188b4572","authors":["Fedele, Roberta","Martino, Massimo","Recchia, Anna Grazia","Irrera, Giuseppe","Gentile, Massimo","Morabito, Fortunato"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/968212","first_seen_on":"2016-01-21T15:20:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2314-7156"],"journal":"Journal of Immunology Research","last_mentioned_on":1453389593,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26788526"],"pmcid":"PMC4695673","pmid":"26788526","pubdate":"2016-01-21T22:00:35+00:00","title":"Clinical Options in Relapsed or Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma: An Updated Review.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-options-relapsed-refractory-hodgkin-lymphoma-updated-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7003089,"mean":6.2578197435162,"rank":6012594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7003089,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316070,"mean":9.2008063049521,"rank":259304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316070,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":428,"mean":2.0391756440281,"rank":306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":428,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":1.6621318681319,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
