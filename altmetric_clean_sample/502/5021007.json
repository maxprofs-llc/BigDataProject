The potential of SQ-LNS to impact positively upon nutritional status relies on numerous factors, including complementary dietary intake, disease prevalence and dynamics of household utilization, including sharing practices. Therefore, this study sought to elucidate the patterns and determinants of SQ-LNS utilization among children 6-23\u2009months and potential sharing practices of other household members prior to intervention development. In Ntchisi, Malawi and Cabo Delgado, Mozambique, both rural, agricultural settings, we conducted two home-feeding trials of 8 and 6\u2009weeks, respectively, nested within a larger multi-phase, emergent formative research design. Multiple methods, including in-depth interviews (n\u2009=\u200938), direct meal observations (n\u2009=\u200980), full-day child observations (n\u2009=\u200938) and spot checks of SQ-LNS supply (n\u2009=\u200923), were conducted with households (n\u2009=\u200935 in Malawi; n\u2009=\u200924 in Mozambique). Overall, the SQ-LNS was utilized contrary to its recommended use, with 50% of households in Malawi reporting running out of stock too early and 87% of households in Mozambique either overusing or underusing the product. Utilization of SQ-LNS was manifested in four patterns of overuse and two of underuse and was determined by factors at multiple levels of influence. Maternal and child health efforts need to consider the reasons behind choices by households to overuse or underuse SQ-LNS and design intervention strategies to increase the likelihood of its appropriate utilization. Key Messages An SQ-LNS was not strictly used as recommended in either Malawi or Mozambique during two home-feeding trials that were part of formative research. The findings illustrating high rates of non-compliance with SQ-LNS instructions contradict much of the literature, which suggests minimal to no sharing of such products. Understanding intra-household and inter-household dynamics in the context of programmes with specialized nutritious foods may help to develop more effective nutrition interventions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041c0","authors":["Kodish, Stephen R","Aburto, Nancy J","Nseluke Hambayi, Mutinta","Dibari, Filippo","Gittelsohn, Joel","Kodish, Stephen R.","Aburto, Nancy J."],"doi":"10.1111\/mcn.12234","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-01-21T11:10:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1740-8709","17408695"],"issue":"1","journal":"Maternal & Child Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1501341911,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26787342?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mcn.12234\/full","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mcn.12234\/pdf?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mcn.12234\/pdf","pmid":"26787342","pubdate":"2016-01-21T22:01:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["perinatology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Patterns and determinants of small-quantity LNS utilization in rural Malawi and Mozambique: considerations for interventions with specialized nutritious foods.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/patterns-determinants-smallquantity-lns-utilization-rural-malawi-mozambique-considerations-intervent"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.15,"score_history":{"1y":2.2,"6m":2.2,"3m":2.2,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.15},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":1577317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6710847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":331872,"mean":9.4965517324499,"rank":73897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":257859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":331872,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":506,"mean":7.9208079207921,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":506,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":7.8873090909091,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
