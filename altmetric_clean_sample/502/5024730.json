Although voiding cystourethrography is the gold standard for diagnosing reflux, it is invasive. The aim of the present study was to evaluate color Doppler ultrasonographic measurements of the ureteral jet angle (UJA) as a non-invasive screening tool for detecting reflux.\nWe retrospectively evaluated 125 pediatric patients, 250 renal units, who presented with urinary tract infections or hydronephrosis. All patients underwent color Doppler ultrasonography and voiding cystourethrography. The UJA was measured as the angle between the direction of the ureteral jet and interureteral ridge.\nReflux was diagnosed in 80 patients, 117 renal units. The mean value of the UJA was significantly higher in refluxing units (67.9 \u00b1 18.7\u00b0) than in non-refluxing units (47.8 \u00b1 17.3\u00b0, p < 0.0001). The angle value in each reflux grade became significantly higher according to its grade (p < 0.0001). The overall ability of the UJA to detect grade III-V or grade IV, V reflux, as given by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, was 0.81 or 0.88, respectively. A cut-off angle \u2265 55\u00b0 detected grade III-V or grade IV, V reflux with a sensitivity of 85.5% or 94.7%, respectively. A cut-off angle \u2265 70\u00b0 diagnosed grade IV, V reflux with a sensitivity of 81.6% and specificity of 82.7%.\nColor Doppler ultrasonographic measurements of the UJA represent a simple and non-invasive method that is applicable as a screening tool to detect high grade vesicoureteral reflux in children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f12","authors":["Asanuma, Hiroshi","Matsui, Zenichi","Satoh, Hiroyuki","Asai, Nobuyoshi","Nukui, Chizuko","Aoki, Yujiro","Mizuno, Ryuichi","Oya, Mototsugu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.juro.2016.01.055","first_seen_on":"2016-01-22T02:37:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-5347","1527-3792"],"journal":"The Journal of Urology","last_mentioned_on":1453430203,"links":["http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S0022-5347(16)00090-2\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S0022534716000902\/pdf","pmid":"26804751","pubdate":"2016-01-26T22:01:37+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Color Doppler Ultrasonographic Evaluation of the Ureteral Jet Angle to Detect Vesicoureteral Reflux in Children","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/color-doppler-ultrasound-evaluation-ureteral-jet-angle-detect-vesicoureteral-reflux-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7007649,"mean":6.258769735863,"rank":3468449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2029574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7007649,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316870,"mean":9.2019712499485,"rank":164607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":117841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316870,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7192,"mean":4.1932813238771,"rank":4439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":1379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7192,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":505,"mean":6.4360317460317,"rank":440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":505,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TrueDiagnostics\/statuses\/690362426043273216","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5024730],"posted_on":"2016-01-22T02:36:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Jerry Lee","url":"http:\/\/www.truediag.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/567483990097936384\/6uKJglvi_normal.jpeg","description":"We specialize in providing quick & simple quantitative test systems designed for point-of-care monitoring.
