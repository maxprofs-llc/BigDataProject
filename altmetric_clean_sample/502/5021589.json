Air trapping indexes, \u0394SV0.4 and \u0394SV0.5, were defined as volume fraction of lung below 0.4 and 0.5 \u0394SV, respectively. To assess the gravity effect of air-trapping, \u0394SV values of anterior and posterior lung at three different levels were measured and \u0394SV ratio of anterior lung to posterior lung was calculated. Color-coded \u0394SV map of the whole lung was generated and visually assessed. Mean \u0394SV, \u0394SV0.4, and \u0394SV0.5 were compared between healthy volunteers and asthmatics. In asthmatics, correlation between air trapping indexes and clinical parameters were assessed.\nMean \u0394SV, \u0394SV0.4, and \u0394SV0.5 in asthmatics were significantly higher than those in healthy volunteer group (all p < 0.05). \u0394SV values in posterior lung in asthmatics were significantly higher than those in healthy volunteer group (p = 0.049). In asthmatics, air trapping indexes, such as \u0394SV0.5 and \u0394SV0.4, showed negative strong correlation with FEF25-75, FEV1, and FEV1\/FVC. \u0394SV map of asthmatics showed abnormal geographic pattern in 5 patients (55.6%) and disappearance of anterior-posterior gradient in 3 patients (33.3%).\nQuantitative assessment of \u0394SV (the ratio of air fraction released after exhalation) shows the difference in extent of air trapping between health volunteers and asthmatics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc61","authors":["Lee, Eunsol","Seo, Joon Beom","Lee, Hyun Joo","Chae, Eun Jin","Lee, Sang Min","Oh, Sang Young","Kim, Namkug"],"doi":"10.3348\/kjr.2015.16.3.632","first_seen_on":"2016-01-21T12:25:53+00:00","issns":["2005-8330"],"issue":"3","journal":"Korean Journal of Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1453379133,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25995694?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25995694","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Quantitative Assessment of Global and Regional Air Trappings Using Non-Rigid Registration and Regional Specific Volume Change of Inspiratory\/Expiratory CT Scans: Studies on Healthy Volunteers and Asthmatics.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-assessment-global-regional-air-trappings-using-nonrigid-registration-regional-specific"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7003089,"mean":6.2578197435162,"rank":5235151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":990641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7003089,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316071,"mean":9.2007784604673,"rank":217115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":56780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316071,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151,"mean":1.5276666666667,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.065625,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/asthma_papers\/statuses\/690148222430531584","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5021589],"posted_on":"2016-01-21T12:25:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Asthma Papers","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439482171208646656\/OWe4b0kE_normal.jpeg","description":"RSS feed for #asthma papers in #Pubmed.
