The dynamic SpineCor (SC) brace is prescribed in several scoliosis clinics worldwide but its effectiveness remains controversial.\nTo compare the treatment effectiveness of the SC in patients with AIS treated by the developers of the brace with that of the Bb at a single institution.\nRetrospective comparison between a cohort of patients treated for AIS using the SC brace and a cohort treated with the Bb.\nWe assessed 243 patients treated with either a Bb or a SC brace to prevent the progression AIS.\nThe primary outcome was the progression in main Cobb angle when reaching one of the following end point criteria: (1) progression of Cobb angle \u22656\u00b0, (2) main Cobb angle \u226545\u00b0, (3) surgery undertaken, or (4) reaching skeletal maturity (Risser sign of 5 or growth <1cm in previous 6 months).\nPatients were identified at a single institution between 2000 and 2012 following the SRS criteria for brace treatment: (1) diagnosis of AIS (2) Risser sign \u22642, (3) curve magnitude between 25\u00b0 to 40\u00b0, and (4) age \u226510 years. A total of 97 patients treated with the SC by the developers of the brace and 146 patients treated with the Bb were identified. Data collection and radiograph measurements were performed by a single experienced nurse not involved in the decision-making for brace treatment nor in the data analysis. Age and Risser sign at onset of treatment, initial main Cobb angle, curve type and duration of the follow-up were similar in both cohorts. Statistical analysis was done using chi-square and logistic regression models with a level of significance of 0.05.\nThe average progression was 14.7\u00b0\u00b111.9\u00b0 in the SC cohort compared with 9.6\u00b0\u00b113.7\u00b0 in the Bb cohort (p=0.003). The average Cobb angle at the endpoint of the study reached 47\u00b0\u00b113\u00b0 in the SC cohort and 41.7\u00b0\u00b114.2\u00b0 in the Bb cohort (p=0.005), while it was 32.2\u00b0\u00b14.9\u00b0 and 32.2\u00b0\u00b14.4\u00b0 respectively for the SC and Bb cohorts at the onset of bracing. The percentage of patients with a progression \u22656\u00b0 was 76% in the SC cohort and 55% in the Bb cohort (p=0.001). The proportion of patients reaching 45\u00b0 in the SC and Bb cohorts was respectively 51 % and 37 % (p=0.03), while the proportion of patients referred to surgery was 39 % and 30% respectively for the SC and Bb cohorts (p=0.2). The odds of progressing \u22656\u00b0 and of reaching \u226545\u00b0 were 2.67 and 2.07 times greater respectively when using the SC brace.\nThe SC brace did not prevent curve progression as effectively as the Bb. Although it has the potential benefit of increasing mobility during brace wear, the SC brace was associated with increased curve progression in comparison to the Bb. There is also a trend for increased risk of requiring surgery when a SC brace is worn.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a8","authors":["Gabriel Gutman","Mathieu Benoit","Julie Joncas","Marie Beausejour","Soraya Barchi","Hubert Labelle","Stefan Parent","Jean-Marc Mac-Thiong","Gutman, Gabriel","Benoit, Mathieu","Joncas, Julie","Beausejour, Marie","Barchi, Soraya","Labelle, Hubert","Parent, Stefan","Mac-Thiong, Jean-Marc"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.spinee.2016.01.020","endpage":"631","first_seen_on":"2016-01-23T01:23:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1529-9430","1878-1632","15299430"],"issue":"5","journal":"Spine Journal","last_mentioned_on":1480970988,"links":["http:\/\/www.thespinejournalonline.com\/article\/S1529-9430(16)00129-7\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26809149","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.spinee.2016.01.020","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26809149\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26809149","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26809149\/?i=2&from=The+effectiveness+of+the+SpineCor+brace+for+the+conservative+treatment+of+adolescent+idiopathic+scoliosis&sort=Title"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.thespinejournalonline.com\/article\/S1529943016001297\/pdf","pmid":"26809149","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"626","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"The effectiveness of the SpineCor brace for the conservative treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. comparison with the boston brace.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effectiveness-spinecor-brace-conservative-treatment-adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-comparison-bosto"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7849747,"mean":6.6509658923939,"rank":3334945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4402913,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7849747,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":327741,"mean":9.3633156160367,"rank":124236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":197174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":327741,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2112,"mean":4.0694050213169,"rank":617,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":1455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2112,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190,"mean":2.439417989418,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
