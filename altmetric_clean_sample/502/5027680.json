The cardiac abnormalities included increased cardiac enzymes, electrocardiographic anomalies and echocardiographic changes, all reverting to normal within days. This case demonstrates a similarity and association between IPE and TC, and the importance of prompt cardiac investigations both in the investigation of IPE and in making the diagnosis of TC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9223cf058f61000d966","authors":["Ng, Andrew","Edmonds, Carl"],"first_seen_on":"2016-01-22T18:28:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1833-3516"],"issue":"4","journal":"Diving and hyperbaric medicine the journal of the South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society","last_mentioned_on":1456313083,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26687314","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26687314?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26687314","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["militarymedicine","sportsmedicine"],"title":"Immersion pulmonary oedema and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immersion-pulmonary-oedema-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7269211,"mean":6.3660833867746,"rank":1384141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5877510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7269211,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319515,"mean":9.2906541747777,"rank":74371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":244588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319515,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":2.486935483871,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":4,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DukeDiveMed\/statuses\/690601988258697216","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5027680],"posted_on":"2016-01-22T18:28:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Duke Dive Medicine","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/447030110189662209\/XxpZ59dV_normal.jpeg","description":"Doctors for divers.
