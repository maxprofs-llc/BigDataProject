Twenty four clinicians who worked with the LCNS participated in individual interviews. Six LCNSs took part in a group interview and 60 lung cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT) members and co-ordinators were observed in the MDT meeting.\nThe LCNS is crucial within the MDT and can act as a catalyst to patient access to treatment. The study identified the clinical activity (assessment, managing symptoms, psychological support and information provision) and role characteristics that can facilitate treatment access. These characteristics are the LCNS's presence across the patient pathway, acting as the 'hub' of the MDT, maintaining a holistic patient focus and working to an advanced level of practice. The findings indicate how factors may have a cumulative impact on treatment access.\nIf UK patient with lung cancer survival rates are to improve in line with comparable countries, we need to employ every advantage. This study demonstrates how the LCNS role may open doors to positive patient outcomes, including treatment. Further research is required to explore patients' experiences, decision-making and attitudes to treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Angela Mary Tod","Judy Redman","Ann McDonnell","Diana Borthwick","John White","Tod, Angela Mary","Redman, Judy","McDonnell, Ann","Borthwick, Diana","White, John"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2015-008587","first_seen_on":"2016-01-22T14:29:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"12","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1453476385,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/5\/12\/e008587.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/5\/12\/e008587.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4691737","pmid":"26685023","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","startpage":"e008587","title":"Lung cancer treatment rates and the role of the lung cancer nurse specialist: a qualitative study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/lookup\/doi\/10.1136\/bmjopen-2015-008587","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lung-cancer-treatment-rates-role-lung-cancer-nurse-specialist-qualitative-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8309072,"mean":7.0030073366726,"rank":4182425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3913761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8309072,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":332839,"mean":9.4980556967649,"rank":160687,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":159427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":332839,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6119,"mean":16.975888198758,"rank":4262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6119,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":417,"mean":21.603673076923,"rank":312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":417,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
