FebLf NCs successfully internalized into breast cancer cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis and induced apoptosis through the downregulation of inhibitor of apoptosis survivin and livin proteins. Investigations revealed a remarkable biocompatibility, anticancer efficacy of the FebLf NCs. Near-infrared imaging observations confirmed selective localization of multimodal FebLf NCs at the tumor site and lead to time-dependent reduction of tumor growth.\nFebLf NCs can be safe, biocompatible nanotheranostic approach for real-time imaging and monitoring the effect of drugs in real time and have potentials in future clinical trials.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000823a","authors":["Kanwar, Jagat R","Kamalapuram, Sishir K","Krishnakumar, Subramanian","Kanwar, Rupinder K"],"doi":"10.2217\/nnm.15.199","first_seen_on":"2016-01-21T11:04:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1748-6963"],"issue":"3","journal":"Nanomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1453374190,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26785603?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26785603","pubdate":"2016-01-21T22:01:40+00:00","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Multimodal iron oxide (Fe3O4)-saturated lactoferrin nanocapsules as nanotheranostics for real-time imaging and breast cancer therapy of claudin-low, triple-negative (ER(-)\/PR(-)\/HER2(-)).","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multimodal-iron-oxide-fe3o4saturated-lactoferrin-nanocapsules-nanotheranostics-realtime-imaging-brea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7003089,"mean":6.2578197435162,"rank":5235121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":990759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7003089,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316070,"mean":9.2007336942247,"rank":217107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":56842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316070,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":428,"mean":2.9009133489461,"rank":266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":428,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":13.1572,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
