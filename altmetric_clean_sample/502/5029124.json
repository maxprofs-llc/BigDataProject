CAR mediates adenoviral infection, as well as adenovirus-mediated oncolysis of AxdAdB-3, an E1A\/E1B double-restricted oncolytic adenovirus, in prostate cancer cells. This study further assessed the therapeutic efficacy of AxdAdB-3 with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-fiber modification (AxdAdB3-F\/RGD), which enables integrin-dependent infection, in prostate cancer. Susceptibility of prostate cancer cells LNCaP, PC3, and DU145 to adenovirus infection was associated with CAR expression. All of the prostate cancer cell lines expressed integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25. AxdAdB-3 was more cytopathic in CAR-positive prostate cancer cells than in CAR-negative cells, whereas AxdAdB3-F\/RGD caused potent oncolysis in both CAR-positive and CAR-negative prostate cancer cells. In contrast, AxdAdB3-F\/RGD was not cytopathic against normal prostate epithelial cells, RWPE-1. Intratumoral injection of AxdAdB3-F\/RGD into CAR-negative prostate cancer cell xenografts in nude mice inhibited tumor growth. The current study demonstrates that E1A\/E1B double-restricted oncolytic adenovirus with an RGD-fiber modification enhances infection efficiency and anti-tumor activity in CAR-deficient prostate cancer cells, while sparing normal cells. Future studies will evaluate the therapeutic potential of AxdAdB3-F\/RGD in prostate cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yue-Hong Shen","Fei Yang","Hua Wang","Zhi-Jian Cai","Yi-Peng Xu","An Zhao","Ying Su","Gu Zhang","Shao-Xing Zhu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0147173","first_seen_on":"2016-01-23T03:16:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1453518980,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0147173"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0147173.PDF","pmcid":"PMC4723068","pmid":"26799485","pubdate":"2016-01-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0147173","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-Modified E1A\/E1B Double Mutant Adenovirus Enhances Antitumor Activity in Prostate Cancer Cells In Vitro and in Mice","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/argglyasp-rgdmodified-e1ae1b-double-mutant-adenovirus-enhances-antitumor-activity-prostate-cancer-ce"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7012411,"mean":6.2597681384832,"rank":6021924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7012411,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":317436,"mean":9.205452391828,"rank":260566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":317436,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102996,"mean":10.013041351522,"rank":86728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102996,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5034,"mean":11.908591694814,"rank":4341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5034,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aprendedorweb\/statuses\/690734782934859776","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5029124],"posted_on":"2016-01-23T03:16:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Alex","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/877344770355494917\/nOWNu028_normal.jpg","description":"Aprende de todo, Aprende de todos.","id_on_source":"aprendedorweb","tweeter_id":"2806836826","geo":{"lt":32.65002,"ln":-115.46107,"country":"MX"},"followers":1278},"tweet_id":"690734782934859776"}]}}
