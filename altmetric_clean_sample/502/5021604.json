By adjusting the duration of the dMSGs with the diffusion time and with the mechanical vibration frequency, the shear wave motion and diffusion are encoded into the MR phase and MR magnitude signals, respectively. The dMSGs are applied in a noncollinear and noncoplanar manner that optimizes the capture of both the DTI signal attenuation and the three-dimensional MRE displacements. In this work, the feasibility of the DTI-MRE technique was demonstrated on in vivo mouse brains (n=3) using a 9.4T animal MRI scanner. The DTI-MRE derived parameters (MD, mean diffusivity; FA, fractional anisotropy; MRE displacement fields; and shear modulus |G|) were compared with those acquired using conventional, separate MRE and diffusion methods.\nThe averaged (MD, FA, and |G|) values for three mice are (0.580\u2009\u00b1\u20090.050\u2009\u00b5m(2) \/ms, 0.43\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02, and 4.80\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06 kPa) and (0.583\u2009\u00b1\u20090.035\u2009\u00b5m(2) \/ms, 0.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02, and 4.91\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19 kPa) for DTI-MRE, and conventional DTI and 3D-vector field MRE measurements, respectively. All derived parameters (MD, FA, |G|, and displacement) obtained using the combined DTI-MRE method and conventional methods were significantly correlated with P\u2009<\u20090.05.\nSimultaneous acquisition of DTI and 3D-vector field MRE is feasible in vivo and reduces the scan time by up to 50% compared with conventional, separate acquisitions, while providing an immediate co-registration of maps of diffusion properties and stiffness.
