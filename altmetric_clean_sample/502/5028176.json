The prominent lymphotropism of vCJD prions raises the possibility that some surgical procedures may be at risk of iatrogenic vCJD transmission in healthcare facilities. It is therefore vital that decontamination procedures applied to medical devices before their reprocessing are thoroughly validated. A current limitation is the lack of a rapid model permissive to human prions. Here, we developed a prion detection assay based on protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) technology combined with stainless-steel wire surfaces as carriers of prions (Surf-PMCA). This assay allowed the specific detection of minute quantities (10-8 brain dilution) of either human vCJD or ovine scrapie PrPTSE adsorbed onto a single steel wire, within a two week timeframe. Using Surf-PMCA we evaluated the performance of several reference and commercially available prion-specific decontamination procedures. Surprisingly, we found the efficiency of several marketed reagents to remove human vCJD PrPTSE was lower than expected. Overall, our results demonstrate that Surf-PMCA can be used as a rapid and ultrasensitive assay for the detection of human vCJD PrPTSE adsorbed onto a metallic surface, therefore facilitating the development and validation of decontamination procedures against human prions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Maxime Belondrade","Simon Nicot","Vincent B\u00e9ringue","Joliette Coste","Sylvain Lehmann","Daisy Bougard","Belondrade, Maxime","Nicot, Simon","B\u00e9ringue, Vincent","Coste, Joliette","Lehmann, Sylvain","Bougard, Daisy"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0146833","first_seen_on":"2016-01-22T19:55:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1468658434,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0146833","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26800081"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0146833.PDF","pmcid":"PMC4723062","pmid":"26800081","pubdate":"2016-01-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0146833","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Rapid and Highly Sensitive Detection of Variant Creutzfeldt - Jakob Disease Abnormal Prion Protein on Steel Surfaces by Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification: Application to Prion Decontamination Studies","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rapid-highly-sensitive-detection-variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease-abnormal-prion-protein-steel-surf"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8078414,"mean":6.8578859978971,"rank":753706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7320191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8078414,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":330028,"mean":9.4710049056586,"rank":40099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":289484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":330028,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112451,"mean":10.56086500667,"rank":16277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":96059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112451,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5017,"mean":12.235481259968,"rank":747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":4264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5017,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
