Notably, although the Gray-Agassiz debate has become one of the most thoroughly studied scientific debates, historians of science remain unable to answer one critical question: How was Gray able to acquire specimens from Japan? Making use of previously unknown archival materials, this article scrutinizes the institutional, instrumental, financial, and military settings that enabled Gray's collector, Charles Wright (1811-1885), to travel to Japan, as well as examine Wright's collecting practices in Japan. I argue that it is necessary to examine Gray's diagnosis of Japan's flora and the subsequent debate about it from the viewpoint of field sciences. The field-centered approach not only unveils an array of historical significances that have been overshadowed by the analytical framework of the Darwinian revolution and the reception of Darwinism, but also places a seemingly domestic incident in a transnational context.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4de3cf058f610001d3e","authors":["Kuang-chi Hung"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10739-015-9431-6","first_seen_on":"2016-01-22T09:17:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-0387","0022-5010"],"journal":"Journal of the History of Biology","last_mentioned_on":1453461188,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10739-015-9431-6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10739-015-9431-6.pdf","pmid":"26791017","pubdate":"2016-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"History And Philosophy Of Specific Fields","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Historical Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Social Sciences","Arts and Humanities"],"subjects":["biology","historyofmedicine"],"title":"\u201cPlants that Remind Me of Home\u201d: Collecting, Plant Geography, and a Forgotten Expedition in the Darwinian Revolution","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plants-remind-me-home-collecting-plant-geography-forgotten-expedition-darwinian-revolution"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7007649,"mean":6.258769735863,"rank":3200836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3749013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7007649,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316870,"mean":9.2020640327704,"rank":146875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":166647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316870,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229,"mean":3.4810350877193,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.85,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
