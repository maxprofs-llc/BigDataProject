In healthy people the opening of these anastomoses affects the degree of exercise-induced increase in pulmonary arterial pressure. The presence of these IPAVAs can be demonstrated using saline contrast echocardiography.\nThe aims of the present study were to characterize severely affected, naturally infected dogs with Angiostrongylus\u00a0vasorum, to evaluate if these dogs can open IPAVAs, and to assess if the recruitment of such anastomoses affects the severity of pulmonary hypertension (PH).\nEight client-owned dogs with severe A. vasorum infection were recruited.\nDogs with A. vasorum infection that presented with severe dyspnea and\/or syncope were prospectively screened by echocardiography for the presence of PH and IPAVAs. Only severely affected dogs, based on a combination of clinical, radiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities, were enrolled.\nOpening of IPAVAs could be demonstrated in three dogs with no to moderate PH, and could not be demonstrated in five dogs with severe PH. In two dogs thoracic radiographs showed only mild interstitial changes, while computer tomography and postmortem examination revealed severe pulmonary interstitial and vascular disease.\nThese results suggest that dogs may open IPAVAs and that opening of such anastomoses may play a regulatory role in the development of PH. There may be a marked discrepancy between radiographic changes and disease severity in A.vasorum.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f1c","authors":["J. Novo Matos","A. Malbon","M. Dennler","T.
