This study provides a definition for IH, a diagnosing algorithm, and information on several factors influencing IH formation.\nBaseline characteristics, laboratory findings, imaging studies, operative findings, and follow up data of 1583 patients that underwent LRYGB at our bariatric facility between 2007 and 2013 were recorded. Follow up varied between 3 and 76\u00a0months, and 85\u00a0% of the data was available for analysis at 12\u00a0months. Our surgical technique was standardized. Intermesenteric spaces were not closed until July 2012, where after they were closed. To facilitate comparison, IH cases were matched with controls.\nForty patients (2.5\u00a0%) had an IH during re-laparoscopy. The modal clinical presentation is acute onset epigastric discomfort, often crampy\/colicky in nature. Additional examinations included laboratory testing, abdominal X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, and abdominal CT scanning. Patients who developed an IH lost a significantly higher percentage of their total body weight than their matched controls at every time point. IH incidence was higher in the non-closure group than the closure group.\nThe large variation in reported IH incidence is due to the large variation in IH definition. To gain more uniformity in reporting IH prevalence, we propose the use of the AMSTERDAM classification. Post-LRYGB patients with acute onset crampy\/colicky epigastric pain should undergo abdominal ultrasound to rule out gallbladder pathology and offered re-laparoscopy with a low threshold. IH incidence is highest among patients with rapid weight loss and non-closure of intermesenteric defects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f610008357","authors":["Geubbels, No\u00eblle","R\u00f6ell, Eveline A","Acherman, Yair I Z","Bruin, Sjoerd C","van de Laar, Arnold W J M","de Brauw, L Maurits"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11695-015-2028-5","first_seen_on":"2016-01-21T11:31:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1708-0428"],"journal":"Obesity Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1453749599,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26787196?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11695-015-2028-5"],"pmid":"26787196","pubdate":"2016-01-21T22:01:03+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["metabolism","generalsurgery"],"title":"Internal Herniation After Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery: Pitfalls in Diagnosing and the Introduction of the AMSTERDAM Classification","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/internal-herniation-after-laparoscopic-rouxeny-gastric-bypass-surgery-pitfalls-diagnosing-introducti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7028853,"mean":6.2639093712573,"rank":2635037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4386784,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7028853,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316420,"mean":9.2070276690082,"rank":108360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":207556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316420,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1645,"mean":3.1306107055961,"rank":379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":1264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1645,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":4.1575918367347,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
