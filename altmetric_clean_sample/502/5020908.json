The study sample included 88,668 children ages 10-17 with data on body mass index (BMI), parental reporting of asthma diagnosis, and potential confounders. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the crude and adjusted odds ratios stratified by child race\/ethnicity.\nThe prevalence of overweight was 15.2% and obesity was 14.1%. Self-reported asthma diagnosis was 16.7% in our study sample. Obese children were 51% more likely to have asthma compared to normal weight children after controlling for child's sex, child age, socioeconomic status, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), and neighborhood conditions. Our study also shows that the strength of this association varied by race\/ethnicity after stratification. Being male, being non-Hispanic Black or Multi-racial, below the Federal Poverty Level, ETS and having detracting neighborhood elements were also significantly associated with higher odds of having a self-reported asthma diagnosis.\nWe observed a racial difference in the association between BMI and asthma in US children. Our findings have significant public health implications and may help public health practitioners to target children and adolescents at higher risk of prevention and intervention efforts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f71","authors":["Joseph, Michael","Elliott, Michael","Zelicoff, Alan","Qian, Zhengmin","Trevathan, Edwin","Chang, Jen Jen"],"doi":"10.3109\/02770903.2015.1116084","first_seen_on":"2016-01-21T11:06:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-4303"],"journal":"Journal of Asthma","last_mentioned_on":1453385070,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26787188?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26787188?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26787188","pubdate":"2016-01-21T22:01:03+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Racial disparity in the association between body mass index and self-reported asthma in children: a population-based study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/racial-disparity-association-between-body-mass-index-selfreported-asthma-children-populationbased-st-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7003089,"mean":6.2578197435162,"rank":4984913,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1768047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7003089,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316070,"mean":9.2008401583196,"rank":198681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":98946,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316070,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":993,"mean":3.0263044354839,"rank":732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":993,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.9637931034483,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1,"Mathematics":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ACNPed\/statuses\/690127863727706112","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5020908],"posted_on":"2016-01-21T11:04:39+00:00","author":{"name":"ACNP","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1687251577\/logo_normal.png","description":"Asociaci\u00f3n Colombiana de Neumolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica","id_on_source":"ACNPed","tweeter_id":"434250807","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":157},"tweet_id":"690127863727706112"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/asthma_papers\/statuses\/690173127037353984","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5020908],"posted_on":"2016-01-21T14:04:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Asthma Papers","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439482171208646656\/OWe4b0kE_normal.jpeg","description":"RSS feed for #asthma papers in #Pubmed.
