Six infant behaviors were coded for 1-minute pre-needle and 3-minutes post-needle. Attachment was operationalized according to the secure\/avoidant\/resistant\/disorganized categories.\nAs expected, none of the pre-needle behaviors predicted attachment. Proximity-seeking post-needle significantly discriminated attachment categorizations. Secure infants were more likely to seek proximity to caregivers post-needle in comparison with avoidant and disorganized infants. Proximity-seeking following immunization was positively correlated with proximity-seeking during the SSP and negatively correlated with avoidance and disorganization during the SSP.\nInfant proximity-seeking during immunization is associated with attachment security and parallels behaviors observed during the SSP. More research is needed to identify behavioral markers of disorganization.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f6100015f6","authors":["Rachel Horton"],"doi":"10.1080\/14616734.2015.1115113","first_seen_on":"2016-01-21T22:01:44+00:00","issns":["1469-2988"],"issue":"1","journal":"Attachment &amp; Human Development","last_mentioned_on":1453854973,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/eprint\/7Au7iQccd5cVNxnBC2DU\/full"],"pmid":"26653987","pubdate":"2016-01-21T22:46:56+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"Do infant behaviors following immunization predict attachment?
