We examine type of insurance and continuity of coverage between time periods, including by poverty status and whether or not women live in a state that expanded Medicaid coverage.\nThe proportion of women who were uninsured declined by almost 40% (from 19% to 12%), though several groups, including U.S. born and foreign-born Latinas, experienced no significant declines. Among low-income women in states that expanded Medicaid, the proportion uninsured declined from 38% to 15%, largely due to an increase in Medicaid coverage (from 40% to 62%). Declines in uninsurance in non-expansion states were only marginally significant.\nDespite substantial improvements in health insurance coverage, significant gaps remain, particularly in states that have not expanded Medicaid and for Latinas.\nThis analysis examines changes in insurance coverage that occurred after the Affordable Care Act was implemented. While coverage has improved for many populations, sizeable gaps in coverage remain for Latinas and women in states that did not expand Medicaid.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000376a","authors":["Rachel K.
