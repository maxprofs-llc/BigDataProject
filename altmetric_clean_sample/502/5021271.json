In this paper, we developed functional, multiform DNA nanostructures by appending tumor penetrating peptide to tetrahedral DNA nanostructure (p-TDN). This functional structure is able to efficiently increase the uptake of the glioblastoma cell U87MG compared with the DNA tetrahedron and the double strand DNA structures. We found that the DNA tetrahedron plays the main role in the endocytosis of U87MG cells, whereas the tumor penetrating peptide could also bind with the transmembrane glycoprotein neuropilin-1 and mediate the endocytosis of the p-TDN nanostructure. Moreover, given the high efficiency of the growth inhibitory effect of the p-TDN loading doxorubicin hydrochloride, the p-TDN claims itself as a promising candidate of an effective delivery carrier.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["Xia, Zhiwei","Wang, Ping","Liu, Xunwei","Liu, Ting","Yan, Yinan","Yan, Juan","Zhong, Jian","Sun, Gang","He, Dannong"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.biochem.5b01181","first_seen_on":"2016-01-21T11:31:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-4995"],"journal":"Biochemistry (00062979)","last_mentioned_on":1453375875,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26789283?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26789283","pubdate":"2016-01-21T22:00:21+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Tumor Penetrating Peptide Modified DNA Tetrahedron for Targeting Drug Delivery.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tumorpenetrating-peptidemodified-dna-tetrahedron-targeting-drug-delivery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7003089,"mean":6.2578197435162,"rank":6012536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7003089,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316070,"mean":9.2007743499043,"rank":259267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316070,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6339,"mean":2.5996591984853,"rank":5868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6339,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127,"mean":1.9047619047619,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
