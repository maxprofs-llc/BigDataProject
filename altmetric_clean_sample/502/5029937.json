Relevant reports in literature were reviewed.\nA preterm infnat at gestational age of 35 weeks with birth weight of 1 900 g was admitted to our department. Oral ibuprofen for closure of the patent ductus arteriosus failed, and the patient exhibited the features of\"ventilator dependent\"PDA of premature infants. On the 30th postnatal day, with the body weight of 1 950 g, under basal anesthesia, the infant underwent percutaneous transcatheter PDA occlusion, and the procedure successfully occluded the ductus with Amplatzer duct occluder (ADO). The ventilator was weaned 19 hours post procedure, and the child was discharged 7 days post operation with good recovery, and her growth and development was good. Follow-up for 13 months indicated that the intelligence and physical development evaluated by Bayley scales of infant development test were at the same level of normal age-matched infants. Fifty-two preterm infants treated with percutaneous transcatheter PDA occlusion in 8 reports were enrolled. The preterm infants were born at 23-35 gestational weeks, with PDA diameter of 1-4 mm. The occlusive device included coil, ADO, ADO \u2161, ADO \u2161 AS, AVP \u2161 and AVP \u2163 respectively, with body weight of 870-2 610 g on operational days and age of 11-90 postnatal days. All those infants either failed or had contraindications to drug therapy, and exhibited as hsPDA cases. Percutaneous transcatheter PDA occlusions were performed successfully in all 52 cases, and there were no serious procedure-related complications.\nPercutaneous transcatheter PDA occlusion in preterm infants is feasible and showed positive short-term and long-term effects, which provides an important alternative way for patients with the problem. The indications for transcatheter PDA occlusion include premature infants with hsPDA in whom drug therapy failed or is contraindicated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cca2","authors":["Zhou, K Y","Tang, J","Hua, Y M","Shi, X Q","Wang, Y B","Qiao, L N","Wang, X Q","Mu, D Z"],"first_seen_on":"2016-01-23T11:03:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0578-1310"],"issue":"1","journal":"Zhonghua er ke za zhi Chinese journal of pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1474021722,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26791923?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26791923?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26791923","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"[Transcatheter occlusion of patent ductus arteriosus in a preterm infant and review of literatures].","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transcatheter-occlusion-patent-ductus-arteriosus-preterm-infant-review-literatures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":7251878,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":334266,"mean":9.5144416735221,"rank":279698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":334266,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":0.73223880597015,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.5,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/690851743115046912","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5029937],"posted_on":"2016-01-23T11:01:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
