Genomics research was fueled initially by government and nonprofit funding sources, later augmented by private research and development (R&D) funding. Citizens and taxpayers of many countries have funded much of the research, and have expectations about access to the resulting information and knowledge. While access to knowledge gained from all publicly funded research is desired, access is especially important for fields that have broad social impact and stimulate public dialogue. Genomics is one such field, where public concerns are raised for reasons such as health care and insurance implications, as well as personal and ancestral identification. Thus, genomics has grown rapidly as a field, and attracts considerable interest.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Pohlhaus, Jennifer Reineke","Cook-Deegan, Robert M","Jennifer Reineke Pohlhaus","Robert M Cook-Deegan","Jennifer Pohlhaus"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-9-472","first_seen_on":"2013-11-08T17:30:00+00:00","handle":"10161\/8935","handles":["10161\/8935"],"issns":["1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1488395642,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/9\/472","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2576262\/","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2164-9-472"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-9-472.pdf","pmcid":"PMC2576262","pmid":"18847466","pubdate":"2008-10-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Algorithms","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Combinatorial Libraries","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computational Biology\/Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"472","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Genomics Research: World Survey of Public Funding","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2164-9-472","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomics-research-world-survey-public-funding"},"altmetric_score":{"score":24,"score_history":{"1y":10.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":24},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":363763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7924214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149672,"mean":7.1429288105246,"rank":7511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":142103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149672,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5854,"mean":4.1996835810695,"rank":128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":5726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5854,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210,"mean":4.1115119617225,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dicentric\/status\/398864383981268992","license":"public","citation_ids":[1892655],"posted_on":"2013-11-08T17:27:34+00:00","author":{"name":"DrB","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/909945661507829760\/YknGKqLi_normal.jpg","description":"scientist. professor.
