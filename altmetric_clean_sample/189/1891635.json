The province of Ontario recently de-insured IVF. Both provinces cited cost-effectiveness as their grounds, but the question as to whether a public health insurance system ought to cover IVF raises the deeper question of how we should understand reproduction at the social level, and whether its costs should be a matter of individual or collective responsibility. In this article I examine three strategies for justifying collective provisions in a liberal society and assess whether public reproductive assistance can be defended on any of these accounts. I begin by considering, and rejecting, rights-based and needs-based approaches. I go on to argue that instead we ought to address assisted reproduction from the perspective of the contractarian insurance-based model for public health coverage, according to which we select items for inclusion based on their unpredictability in nature and cost. I argue that infertility qualifies as an unpredictable incident against which rational agents would choose to insure under ideal conditions and that assisted reproduction is thereby a matter of collective responsibility, but only in cases of medical necessity or inability to pay. The policy I endorse by appeal to this approach is a means-tested system of coverage resembling neither Ontario nor Quebec's, and I conclude that it constitutes a promising alternative worthy of serious consideration by bioethicists, political philosophers, and policy-makers alike.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023cc","authors":["Panitch, Vida"],"doi":"10.1111\/bioe.12067","endpage":"117","first_seen_on":"2013-11-08T08:58:43+00:00","issns":["1467-8519","0269-9702"],"issue":"2","journal":"Bioethics","last_mentioned_on":1409124517,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bioe.12067\/abstract;jsessionid=9C126161353C51447D3028D625433DC0.f04t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bioe.12067\/abstract;jsessionid=9BDF5C5887EC1F4A301675584428661B.f02t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bioe.12067\/pdf","pmid":"24602147","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"108","subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Assisted Reproduction and Distributive Justice","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assisted-reproduction-distributive-justice-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4185741,"mean":5.1218776492683,"rank":3342145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":114882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4185741,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101813,"mean":7.7423238321613,"rank":80548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101813,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":393,"mean":3.6898418367347,"rank":278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":393,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
