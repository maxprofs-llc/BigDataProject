Discordant cases were defined as those for which the pathogens isolated from urine and from blood were different. We found that 97.6% of cases were nondiscordant. Clinical and microbiological evolution of infection did not differ between the 2 groups, and no changes of antibiotic therapy were required on the basis of blood culture results. Blood culture may not be routinely required for the evaluation of uncomplicated pyelonephritis in women.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255e","authors":["Jos\u00e9 Mensa"],"doi":"10.1086\/378291","first_seen_on":"2013-11-12T13:59:36+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1537-6591"],"issue":"8","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1384266176,"links":["http:\/\/cid.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/37\/8\/1127.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cid.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/37\/8\/1127.full.pdf","pmid":"14523779","pubdate":"2003-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Blood Cultures for Women with Uncomplicated Acute Pyelonephritis: Are They Necessary?","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blood-cultures-women-uncomplicated-acute-pyelonephritis-necessary"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":3349763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1481677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108555,"mean":7.8424322457029,"rank":67715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":36633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108555,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5573,"mean":6.6697946877243,"rank":4051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5573,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":4.5963947368421,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
