We have evidence that neuronal activity, including that driven by afferent input, regulates acquisition and loss of the DA phenotype by substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) neurons in adult mice. Hypotheses The aims of the present study were to determine whether the environment or behavior regulates the number of SNc DA neurons in adult mice, and whether this is mediated by afferent input.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbdf","authors":["Aumann TD","Tomas D","Horne MK","Aumann, Tim D.","Tomas, Doris","Horne, Malcolm K.","Tim D.
