However, immune cells such as macrophages might evoke a rejection of an implant due to an undesired activation by the materials. Here, the influence of different strategies for peptide immobilization onto (poly)-vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) on inflammation and angiogenesis is studied. The inflammatory response of human primary macrophages is investigated by analyzing inflammatory cytokine expression. Surface roughness and adsorptive coupling have only minor effects on macrophage activation. Acrylic acid (AAc)-based covalent RGD-coupling leads to the most favorable cellular reaction, indicated by increased VEGF release. Chemical vapor deposition treated surfaces are inert, but additional covalent coupling of RGD induces a pronounced proinflammatory reaction. An in vivo angiogenesis study reveals that covalent coupling of RGD results in delayed but increased angiogenesis. It is concluded that for implant decoration with peptides, the substrate material has to be selected carefully to prevent inflammatory immune responses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008093","authors":["Bartneck, Matthias","Skazik, Claudia","Paul, Nora E.","Salber, Jochen","Klee, Doris","Zwadlo\u2010Klarwasser, Gabriele"],"doi":"10.1002\/mabi.201300362","endpage":"418","first_seen_on":"2013-11-08T12:35:11+00:00","issns":["1616-5195","1616-5187"],"issue":"3","journal":"Macromolecular Bioscience","last_mentioned_on":1395327695,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mabi.201300362\/abstract;jsessionid=82698CEBE4B0EB946BABC0E6C3DD74D9.f04t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mabi.201300362\/abstract;jsessionid=D2773A4C996D3B5B683F6A7753491146.f04t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mabi.201300362\/pdf","pmid":"24821669","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"411","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The RGD Coupling Strategy Determines the Inflammatory Response of Human Primary Macrophages In Vitro and Angiogenesis In Vivo","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rgd-coupling-strategy-determines-inflammatory-response-human-primary-macrophages-vitro-angiogenesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6648777,"mean":6.1582588560636,"rank":5673316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6648777,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142327,"mean":6.8769411491929,"rank":114184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142327,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":844,"mean":2.0159027283511,"rank":576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":844,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.35,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
