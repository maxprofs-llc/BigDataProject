Although the highest copy numbers (p\u00a0<0.05) of ARGs were detected in the bacterial DNA fraction, qnrS and blaSHV genes were found in the phage DNA from all samples analysed, reaching up to 4 log10 copy numbers\/mL in hospital samples. These results indicate that bacteriophages are a potential reservoir of resistance genes and may act as efficient vehicles for horizontal gene transfer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000e10","authors":["Marti, E.","Variatza, E.","Balc\u00e1zar, J.
