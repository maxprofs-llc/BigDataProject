Its treatment is limited so far to the management of parkinsonian symptoms with L-DOPA (LD). The long-term use of LD is limited by the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias and dystonia. However, recent studies have suggested that pharmacological targeting of the endocannabinoid system may potentially provide a valuable therapeutic tool to suppress these motor alterations. In the present study, we have explored the behavioral (L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias severity) and cytological (substantia nigra compacta neurons and striatum neuropil preservation) effects of the oral coadministration of LD and rimonabant, a selective antagonist of CB1 receptors, in the 6-hydroxydopamine rat model of Parkinson's disease. Oral coadministration of LD (30 mg\/kg) and rimonabant (1 mg\/kg) significantly decreased abnormal involuntary movements and dystonia, possibly through the conservation of some functional tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive dopaminergic cells, which in turn translates into a well-preserved neuropil of a less denervated striatum. Our results provide anatomical evidence that long-term coadministration of LD with cannabinoid antagonist-based therapy may not only alleviate specific motor symptoms but also delay\/arrest the degeneration of striatal and substantia nigra compacta cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c00","authors":["Ana L Guti\u00e9rrez-Valdez","Ricardo Garc\u00eda-Ruiz","Ver\u00f3nica Anaya-Mart\u00ednez","Carmen Torres-Esquivel","Jes\u00fas Espinosa-Villanueva","Leonardo Reynoso-Erazo","Rocio Tron-Alvarez","Patricia Aley-Medina","Javier S\u00e1nchez-Betancourt","Enrique Montiel-Flores","Mar\u00eda R Avila-Costa"],"doi":"10.1097\/fbp.0000000000000004","first_seen_on":"2013-11-08T13:05:51+00:00","issns":["1473-5849"],"issue":"8","journal":"Behavioural Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1383915889,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24196024"],"pmid":"24196024","pubdate":"2013-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","pharmacology"],"title":"The combination of oral L-DOPA\/rimonabant for effective dyskinesia treatment and cytological preservation in a rat model of Parkinson's disease and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combination-oral-ldoparimonabant-effective-dyskinesia-treatment-cytological-preservation-rat-model-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":2903861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75801,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97697,"mean":7.7111959343271,"rank":77461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97697,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":494,"mean":2.0988073022312,"rank":460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":494,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":1.5,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Neuroscience":2,"Psychology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"IR":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"The combination of oral L-DOPA\/rimonabant fo...
