Reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR systems for the detection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), two of the most economically important pathogens of swine worldwide, were combined with a screening system for diseases notifiable to the World Organization of Animal Health, namely, classical and African swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease, and Aujeszky's disease. Background screening was implemented using the identical fluorophore for all four different RT-qPCR assays. The novel multiplex RT-qPCR system was validated with a large panel of different body fluids and tissues from pigs and other animal species. Both reference samples and clinical specimens were used for a complete evaluation. It could be demonstrated that a highly sensitive and specific parallel detection of the different viruses was possible. The assays for the notifiable diseases were even not affected by the simultaneous amplification of very high loads of PRRSV- and PCV2-specific sequences. The novel broad-spectrum multiplex assay allows in a unique form the routine investigation for endemic porcine pathogens with exclusion diagnostics of the most important transboundary diseases in samples from pigs with unspecific clinical signs, such as fever or hemorrhages. The new system could significantly improve early detection of the most important notifiable diseases of swine and could lead to a new approach in syndromic surveillance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be9","authors":["Kerstin Wernike","Bernd Hoffmann","Martin Beer"],"doi":"10.1128\/jcm.02947-12","first_seen_on":"2013-11-12T10:20:12+00:00","issns":["1098-660X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Clinical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1384704814,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23303496"],"pmcid":"PMC3592051","pmid":"23303496","pubdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Single-tube multiplexed molecular detection of endemic porcine viruses in combination with background screening for transboundary diseases.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/singletube-multiplexed-molecular-detection-endemic-porcine-viruses-combination-background-screening"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2302175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1601807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102939,"mean":7.7142975771826,"rank":50280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":38021,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102939,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2952,"mean":2.7349752626228,"rank":1479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":964,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2952,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":2.9576744186047,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
