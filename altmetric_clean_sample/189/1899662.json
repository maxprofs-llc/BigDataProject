The bNAber database at http:\/\/bNAber.org provides open, user-friendly access to detailed data on the rapidly growing list of HIV bNAbs, including neutralization profiles, sequences and three-dimensional structures (when available). It also provides an extensive list of visualization and analysis tools, such as heatmaps to analyse neutralization data as well as structure and sequence viewers to correlate bNAbs properties with structural and sequence features of individual antibodies. The goal of the bNAber database is to enable researchers in this field to easily compare and analyse available information on bNAbs thereby supporting efforts to design an effective vaccine for HIV\/AIDS. The bNAber database not only provides easy access to data that currently is scattered in the Supplementary Materials sections of individual papers, but also contributes to the development of general standards of data that have to be presented with the discovery of new bNAbs and a universal mechanism of how such data can be shared.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["Adam Godzik"],"doi":"10.1093\/nar\/gkt1083","first_seen_on":"2013-11-12T12:45:47+00:00","funders":["niaid","nigms"],"issns":["1362-4962"],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","last_mentioned_on":1417564280,"links":["http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/11\/07\/nar.gkt1083.full","http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/11\/07\/nar.gkt1083.abstract","http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/42\/D1\/D1133","http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/42\/D1\/D1133.short?rss=1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/nar\/gkt1083","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24214957","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3964981"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/11\/07\/nar.gkt1083.full.pdf","pmid":"24214957","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"bNAber: database of broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bnaber-database-broadly-neutralizing-hiv-antibodies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7858629,"mean":6.6559729884095,"rank":1183249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6672184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7858629,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145626,"mean":6.9782887416311,"rank":22747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":122815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145626,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10477,"mean":4.3295364642994,"rank":1685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":8783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10477,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":5.9788484848485,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
