Here, we showed that DC cultures stimulated with low-level IFN\u03b3 released exosomes (IFN\u03b3-DC-Exos) that contained microRNA species that can increase baseline myelination, reduce oxidative stress, and improve remyelination following acute lysolecithin-induced demyelination. Furthermore, nasally administered IFN\u03b3-DC-Exos increased CNS myelination in vivo. IFN\u03b3-DC-Exos were preferentially taken up by oligodendrocytes, suggesting that they directly impact oligodendrocytes to increase myelination. Thus, our results show great potential for use of these IFN\u03b3-DC-Exos as a therapeutic to promote remyelination in multiple sclerosis and dysmyelinating syndromes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e75","authors":["Aya D.
