To elucidate ATL pathogenesis in vivo, a variety of animal models have been established; however, the mechanisms driving this disorder remain poorly understood due to deficiencies in each of these animal models. Here, we report a novel HTLV-1-infected humanized mouse model generated by intra-bone marrow injection of human CD133(+) stem cells into NOD\/Shi-scid\/IL-2R\u03b3c null (NOG) mice (IBMI-huNOG mice). Upon infection, the number of CD4(+) human T cells in the periphery increased rapidly, and atypical lymphocytes with lobulated nuclei resembling ATL-specific flower cells were observed 4 to 5 months after infection. Proliferation was seen in both CD25(-) and CD25(+) CD4 T cells with identical proviral integration sites; however, a limited number of CD25(+)-infected T-cell clones eventually dominated, indicating an association between clonal selection of infected T cells and expression of CD25. Additionally, HTLV-1-specific adaptive immune responses were induced in infected mice and might be involved in the control of HTLV-1-infected cells. Thus, the HTLV-1-infected IBMI-huNOG mouse model successfully recapitulated the development of ATL and may serve as an important tool for investigating in vivo mechanisms of ATL leukemogenesis and evaluating anti-ATL drug and vaccine candidates.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Kenta Tezuka","Runze Xun","Mami Tei","Takaharu Ueno","Masakazu Tanaka","Norihiro Takenouchi","Jun-Ichi Fujisawa"],"doi":"10.1182\/blood-2013-06-508861","first_seen_on":"2013-11-08T11:21:01+00:00","issns":["1528-0020"],"journal":"Blood","last_mentioned_on":1383909596,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24196073?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org\/content\/123\/3\/346.short?rss=1"],"pmid":"24196073","pubdate":"2013-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society of Hematology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"An animal model of adult T-cell leukemia-humanized mice with HTLV-1 specific immunity.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/animal-model-adult-tcell-leukemia-humanized-mice-htlv1specific-immunity-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992147,"mean":6.7405564850737,"rank":6057202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1077354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992147,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148211,"mean":7.0201465218273,"rank":93523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":28088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148211,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9609,"mean":5.4059471273938,"rank":7773,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9609,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":5.6979512195122,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
