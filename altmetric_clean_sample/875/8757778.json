Animals in the control group received an AIN-93M diet, and animals in the experimental group received an Atkins-based diet (59.46% protein, 31.77% fat, and 8.77% carbohydrate). After 8 wk, the rats were anesthetized and exsanguinated for transaminases analysis, and their livers were removed for flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and light microscopy studies. We expressed the data as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) assuming unpaired and parametric data; we analyzed differences using the Student's t-test. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.\nWe found that plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group. According to flow cytometry, the percentages of nonviable cells were 11.67% \u00b1 1.12% for early apoptosis, 12.07% \u00b1 1.11% for late apoptosis, and 7.11% \u00b1 0.44% for non-apoptotic death in the experimental diet group and 3.73% \u00b1 0.50% for early apoptosis, 5.67% \u00b1 0.72% for late apoptosis, and 3.82% \u00b1 0.28% for non-apoptotic death in the control diet group. The mean percentage of early apoptosis was higher in the experimental diet group than in the control diet group. Immunohistochemistry for autophagy was negative in both groups. Sinusoidal dilation around the central vein and small hepatocytes was only observed in the experimental diet group, and fibrosis was not identified by hematoxylin-eosin or Trichrome Masson staining in either group.\nEight weeks of an experimental diet resulted in cellular and histopathological lesions in rat livers. Apoptosis was our principal finding; elevated plasma transaminases demonstrate hepatic lesions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d0f","authors":["Monteiro, Maria Em\u00edlia L","Xavier, Analucia R","Oliveira, Felipe L","Filho, Porphirio Js","Azeredo, Vilma B"],"doi":"10.3748\/wjg.v22.i22.5165","first_seen_on":"2016-06-15T11:54:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2219-2840","1007-9327"],"issue":"22","journal":"World Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1465992525,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27298559?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4893463","pmid":"27298559","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"5165","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Apoptosis induced by a low-carbohydrate and high-protein diet in rat livers","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/apoptosis-induced-lowcarbohydrate-highprotein-diet-rat-livers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7902020,"mean":6.6891515940364,"rank":5710813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1909372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7902020,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267775,"mean":11.502473444023,"rank":171842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":80455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267775,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3547,"mean":2.9213632261703,"rank":1843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3547,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.7776666666667,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AutophagyPapers\/statuses\/743023772072968193","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8757778],"posted_on":"2016-06-15T10:14:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Autophagy Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/559405603697590273\/EoGNUIXe_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for #Autophagy papers.
