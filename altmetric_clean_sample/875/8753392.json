Before antidotal treatment, the median plasma lactate concentration was 168 mg\/dL, the median blood cyanide concentration was 4.2 mg\/L. Using Spearman's test, there was a significant correlation between plasma lactate and blood cyanide concentrations ( =.74, =.017). Before antidotal treatment, plasma lactate concentration correlated positively with anion gap and inversely with systolic blood pressure, spontaneous respiratory rate, and arterial pH. During the course of cyanide poisonings, a plasma lactate concentration of >or=72 mg\/d\/L (8 mmol\/L) was sensitive (94%) and moderately specific (70%) for a toxic blood cyanide concentration (>or=1.0 mg\/L). The specificity was substantially improved in patients not receiving catecholamines (85%).\nThe immediate and serial measurement of plasma lactate concentrations is useful in assessing the severity of cyanide poisoning.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000263f","authors":["Baud, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric J","Borron, Stephen W","M\u00e9garbane, Bruno","Trout, Herv\u00e9","Lapostolle, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","Vicaut, Eric","Debray, Marcel","Bismuth, Chantal"],"doi":"10.1097\/01.ccm.0000026325.65944.7d","first_seen_on":"2016-06-15T07:02:19+00:00","issns":["0090-3493"],"issue":"9","journal":"Critical Care Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1417755420,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12352039"],"pmid":"12352039","pubdate":"2002-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["criticalcare"],"title":"Value of lactic acidosis in the assessment of the severity of acute cyanide poisoning.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/value-lactic-acidosis-assessment-severity-acute-cyanide-poisoning-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5234463,"mean":6.1680605028774,"rank":968162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":4258361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5234463,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103486,"mean":10.224810513601,"rank":21326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":81961,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103486,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3610,"mean":6.5191798282073,"rank":1058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":2533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3610,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":5.4316326530612,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
