The functional role of BEX4 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unknown.\nExpression level of BEX family members (BEX1-5) in OSCC tissues and the paired normal epithelial were examined. Functions of epigenetic changes (DNA methylation and histone modifications) on BEX4 suppression in OSCC were examined by zebularine and trichostatin A (TSA) treatment on OSCC cell lines. Lentivector containing full-length BEX4 was used to generate OSCC cell lines with stable BEX4 expression. Effects of BEX4 expression on OSCC proliferation were monitored with xCELLigence RTCA real-time cell analyzer. BEX4-overexpressing CAL27 was implanted into nude mice to evaluate the effects on tumor growth in vivo. The signaling pathways regulated by BEX4 in OSCC was explored using human whole-transcript expression microarray.\nAmong the 5 BEX family members, BEX1 and BEX4 showed significant down-regulation in OSCC (P\u2009<\u20090.001). BEX3, in comparison, was overexpressed in the primary tumor. BEX4 expression in OSCC cell lines was re-activated after zebularine and TSA treatment. High BEX4 expression could suppress proliferation of OSCC in vitro. Subcutaneous tumor volume of BEX4-overexpressing CAL27 was remarkably reduced in nude mice. Microarray experiment showed that S100A family members (S100A7, S100A7A, S100A8, S100A9 & S100A12) might be the downstream targets of BEX4 in OSCC.\nBEX4 functions as tumor suppressor by inhibiting proliferation and growth of oral cancer. Decreased BEX4 contributes to the increased proliferative propensity of OSCC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000851","authors":["Gao, Wei","Li, John Zeng-Hong","Chen, Si-Qi","Chu, Chiao-Yun","Chan, Jimmy Yu-Wai","Wong, Thian-Sze"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13046-016-0355-6","first_seen_on":"2016-06-15T11:51:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1756-9966"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Experimental & Clinical Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1466001574,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27297407?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27297407?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4906687","pmid":"27297407","pubdate":"2016-06-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Apoptosis","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Decreased brain-expressed X-linked 4 (BEX4) expression promotes growth of oral squamous cell carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/decreased-brainexpressed-xlinked-4-bex4-expression-promotes-growth-oral-squamous-cell-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7902020,"mean":6.6891515940364,"rank":5710781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1909403,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7902020,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267774,"mean":11.502437975449,"rank":171825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":80471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267774,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":413,"mean":1.5156553398058,"rank":183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":413,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":0.8109375,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
