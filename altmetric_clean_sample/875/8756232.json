However, little information exists concerning how to reap the best quality seeds of Leymus chinensis, which is the dominant and most promising grass species in the Songnen Grassland of Northern China. The objective of this study was to investigate and evaluate possible quality indices of the seeds at different days after peak anthesis. Seed quality at different development stages was assessed by the colours of the seed and lemmas, seed weight, moisture content, electrical conductivity of seed leachate and germination indices. Two consecutive years of experimental results showed that the maximum seed quality was recorded at 39\u2005days after peak anthesis. At this date, the colours of the seed and lemmas reached heavy brown and yellow, respectively. The seed weight was highest and the moisture content and the electrical conductivity of seed leachate were lowest. In addition, the seed also reached its maximum germination percentage and energy at this stage, determined using a standard germination test (SGT) and accelerated ageing test (AAT). Thus, Leymus chinensis can be harvested at 39\u2005days after peak anthesis based on the changes in parameters. Colour identification can be used as an additional indicator to provide a more rapid and reliable measure of optimum seed maturity; approximately 10\u2005days after the colour of the lemmas reached yellow and the colour of the seed reached heavy brown, the seed of this species was suitable for harvest.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c70","authors":["Jixiang Lin","Yingnan Wang","Mingming Qi","Xiaoyu Li","Chunxue Yang","Yongcui Wang","Chunsheng Mu"],"doi":"10.1242\/bio.017780","first_seen_on":"2016-06-15T11:18:06+00:00","issns":["2046-6390"],"journal":"Biology Open","last_mentioned_on":1465981478,"links":["http:\/\/bio.biologists.org\/content\/5\/6\/720.large.jpg?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bio.biologists.org\/content\/biolopen\/5\/6\/720.full.pdf","pmid":"27170257","pubdate":"2016-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Company of Biologists Ltd","startpage":"bio.017780","title":"\n              Optimum harvest maturity for\n              Leymus chinensis\n              seed\n            ","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7902020,"mean":6.6891515940364,"rank":4143529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2203291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7902020,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267774,"mean":11.502603974261,"rank":145234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267774,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":606,"mean":4.0605123966942,"rank":322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":606,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":6.3170666666667,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/REAvsCDC\/statuses\/743006291199729664","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8756232],"posted_on":"2016-06-15T09:04:38+00:00","author":{"name":"CureTheCDC","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/REAvsCDC\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/745018458908196864\/oJfuofaN_normal.jpg","description":"Please Support #CureTheCDC or join as a Co-plaintiff.E-mail a brief statement of grievances to CureTheCDC@gmail.com","id_on_source":"REAvsCDC","tweeter_id":"712134955996807169","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":370},"tweet_id":"743006291199729664"}]}}
