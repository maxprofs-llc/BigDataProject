Also, clinical knowledge increases with EBVM, reducing the need for information in one area and allowing veterinarians to explore new areas of specialty or cutting-edge advances in the profession. Textbooks, journals, veterinary conferences, and web sites provide nearly unlimited information about EBVM for the practicing veterinarian to help with the transition to EBVM use in daily practice life. EBVM should continue to change and improve how we, as veterinarians, provide the best available care to our clients and patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c6e","authors":["Schmidt PL"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cvsm.2007.01.001","first_seen_on":"2014-11-13T09:15:20+00:00","issns":["0195-5616"],"issue":"3","journal":"Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice","last_mentioned_on":1415870106,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17466746?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"17466746","pubdate":"2007-05-01T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Evidence-based veterinary medicine: evolution, revolution, or repackaging of veterinary practice?","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidencebased-veterinary-medicine-evolution-revolution-repackaging-veterinary-practice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2296996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1614478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122806,"mean":8.6060848825376,"rank":62127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":44717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122806,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236,"mean":1.569029787234,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":8.45,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
