NMDARs are also implicated in a plethora of neuropathological conditions thus receiving strong interest as potential therapeutic targets. Recent years have witnessed major progress in our understanding of the structure and pharmacology of NMDARs with the decoding of the first full-length receptor crystal structures and the discovery of allosteric modulators acting at novel binding sites and with unique patterns of subunit selectivity. Here we review the properties and structural mechanisms of various allosteric modulators that target NMDARs, emphasizing the newly identified compounds. The expanding pharmacology of NMDARs should help delineate the roles of various NMDAR subtypes in brain function, with potential for drug development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a7","doi":"10.1016\/j.coph.2014.10.009","first_seen_on":"2014-11-13T14:47:28+00:00","issns":["14714892"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1415941859,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1471489214001374"],"pmid":"25462287","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Allosteric modulators of NMDA receptors: multiple sites and mechanisms ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/allosteric-modulators-nmda-receptors-multiple-sites-mechanisms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355920,"mean":7.0465669454115,"rank":4455680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2326234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355920,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201084,"mean":8.071059880746,"rank":99203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":80563,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201084,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":480,"mean":3.91151565762,"rank":270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":480,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":3.4909090909091,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Ph.
