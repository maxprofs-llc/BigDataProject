JC virus example"],"citation":{"abstract":"Opportunistic infection of oligodendrocytes by human JC polyomavirus may result into development of progressive multifocal encephalopathy in immune compromised individuals. Neurotropic JC virus generally harbors reorganized non-coding control region (NCCR) DNA interspersed on the viral genome between early and late coding genes. By applying 454 sequencing on NCCR DNA amplified from body fluid samples (urine, plasma and CSF) from nineteen PML patients, we attempted to reveal the composition of the JC polyomavirus population (the quasispecies i.e. the whole of the consensus and minor viral variants) contained in different body compartments and to better understand intra-patient viral dissemination. Our data demonstrate that in CSF of PML patients the JC viral population often is a complex mixture composed of multiple viral variants that contribute to the quasispecies. In contrast, urinary JC virus highly resembled archetype virus and most often did not contain minor viral variants. It also appeared that archetype JC virus sporadically can be identified in PML brain although selection of rearranged JC virus DNA is favored. Comparison of the quasispecies between different body compartments within a given patient suggested a strong correlation between the viral population in plasma and CSF whereas the viral population shed in urine appeared as unrelated. In conclusion, it is shown that the representation of viral DNA in the CSF following high level DNA replication in the brain underlying PML has hitherto been much underestimated. Our data also underscore that the hematogenous route might play a pivotal role in viral dissemination from or towards the brain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Tom Van Loy","Kim Thys","Caroline Ryschkewitsch","Ole Lagatie","Maria C.
