Corticosterone (CORT) is the main glucocorticoid in amphibians and is known to be important in modulating many behaviors and developmental functions. The federally threatened San Marcos salamander, Eurycea nana, decreases activity in response to both native and introduced predatory fish, however, experience may further influence these interactions. To better understand the indirect effects of fish predators on this salamander, we examined both the antipredator behavior and water-borne CORT release rates in response to chemical cues (kairomones) from two fish species that varied in temporal risk of predation: (1) a low encounter frequency predator (largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides), (2) a high encounter frequency predator (redbreast sunfish, Lepomis auritus), and (3) a blank water control. Salamanders reduced activity (antipredator response) after exposure to both predator treatments, but not to the blank water control, and the response to M. salmoides was significantly stronger than that to L. auritus. The CORT response (post-stimulus\/pre-stimulus release rates) did not differ between the blank water control and L. auritus treatments, and both were significantly less than the CORT response to M. salmoides. Overall, E. nana showed a decreased antipredator response and no CORT response towards the high encounter frequency L. auritus as compared to the low encounter frequency M. salmoides. Eurycea nana may mute antipredator and CORT responses to high temporal frequency predators. There was, however, no correlation between CORT release rates and antipredator behavior, which suggests that the presence of predators may be affecting CORT response and behavior independently.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003325","doi":"10.1016\/j.physbeh.2014.11.013","first_seen_on":"2014-11-13T17:31:56+00:00","issns":["00319384"],"journal":"Physiology & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1417625275,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0031938414005289"],"pmid":"25446225","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"title":"Behavioral and physiological antipredator responses of the San Marcos salamander, Eurycea nana ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/behavioral-physiological-antipredator-responses-san-marcos-salamander-eurycea-nana"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.15,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.15},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":789200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":4244594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141843,"mean":8.8048842232909,"rank":28316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":113462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141843,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1601,"mean":7.0688075,"rank":403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":1198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1601,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":10.119659574468,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
