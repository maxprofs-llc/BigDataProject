PAD also fosters major morbidity by causing claudication, functional impairment, disability and amputation. PAD is largely unrecognized and under-treated compared with other cardiovascular diseases. The public health impact of PAD, as a contributor to Canadian national rates of heart attack, stroke, amputation, death and disability, will be challenging to address if the public is unaware of this common cardiovascular disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006dae","authors":["Marge Lovell","Kenneth Harris","Thomas Forbes","Gwen Twillman","Beth Abramson","Michael H Criqui","Paul Schroeder","Emile R Mohler, III","Alan T Hirsch"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0828-282x(09)70021-2","first_seen_on":"2014-11-13T22:55:55+00:00","issns":["0828-282X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Canadian Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1441831565,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onlinecjc.ca%2Farticle%2FS0828-282X%252809%252970021-2%2Fabstract&code=cjca-site","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2691879\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.onlinecjc.ca\/article\/S0828282X09700212\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC2691879","pmid":"19148341","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"39","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Peripheral arterial disease: Lack of awareness in Canada","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/peripheral-arterial-disease-lack-awareness-canada"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6314675,"mean":5.821756001339,"rank":2782060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3363002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6314675,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154771,"mean":8.7042096788785,"rank":72293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":76023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154771,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":596,"mean":7.6749109243697,"rank":309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":596,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":6.872,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
