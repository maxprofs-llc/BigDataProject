The nanopore confinement by the carbon matrix is essential for the formation of \u03b1-NiS and preventing its transition to \u03b2-phase, which is in strong contrast to large aggregated \u03b2-NiS particles grown freely without the confinement of CRs. When used as electrochemical electrode, the hybrid electrochemical charge storage of the ultrasmall \u03b1-NiS nanoparticels dispersed in CRs is benefit for the high capacitor (1092, 946, 835, 740\u2005F g(-1) at current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10\u2005A g(-1), respectively.). While the high electrochemical stability (approximately 100% retention of specific capacitance after 2000 charge\/discharge cycles) is attributed to the supercapacitor-battery electrode, which makes synergistic effect of capacitor (CRs) and battery (NiS NPs) components rather than a merely additive composite. This work not only suggests a general approach for phase-controlled synthesis of nickel sulfide but also opens the door to the rational design and fabrication of novel nickel-based\/carbon hybrid supercapacitor-battery electrode materials.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Chencheng Sun","Mingze Ma","Jun Yang","Yufei Zhang","Peng Chen","Wei Huang","Xiaochen Dong"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep07054","first_seen_on":"2014-11-14T12:24:03+00:00","issns":["xxxx-xxxx","2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1415967763,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/srep07054"],"pmid":"25394517","pubdate":"2014-11-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Materials for energy and catalysis","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Nanoscale materials","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Phase-controlled synthesis of [agr]-NiS nanoparticles confined in carbon nanorods for High Performance Supercapacitors","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phasecontrolled-synthesis-%CE%B1nis-nanoparticles-confined-carbon-nanorods-high-performance-supercapacito"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4504707,"mean":4.9856818325943,"rank":3464464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":132915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4504707,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122377,"mean":8.3012139144931,"rank":90331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122377,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10904,"mean":10.672274236449,"rank":8476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10904,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":652,"mean":9.3639631336406,"rank":522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":652,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
