Detailed spectroscopic and computational analysis confirmed the presence of a coordinated pSQ radical ferromagnetically coupled to the high-spin Fe(II) center. The complexes are intended to model electronic interactions between (semi)quinone and iron cofactors in biology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Amanda E.
