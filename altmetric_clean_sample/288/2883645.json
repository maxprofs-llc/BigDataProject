Key concepts are reviewed, based on the broader experience in human medicine, with adaptations, as indicated, to veterinary medicine. That a paper has been published in a peer-reviewed journal does not guarantee its credibility; guidelines are given regarding the general merit of different kinds of articles, as well as checklists and criteria that can be used to assess a paper. Specific study designs, their merits and limitations, are briefly discussed. Standard numerical indices for assessment of studies involving treatments and for assessments of diagnostic tests are summarized. Criteria for assessing drug trials are presented. The principles of statistical analysis are described, including practical considerations and common errors. Finally, numerous sources of bias are reviewed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000376c","authors":["Kastelic JP"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.theriogenology.2006.04.017","first_seen_on":"2014-11-13T10:49:09+00:00","issns":["0093691X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Theriogenology","last_mentioned_on":1415875684,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16720037?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"16720037","pubdate":"2006-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Critical evaluation of scientific articles and other sources of information: an introduction to evidence-based veterinary medicine.","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/critical-evaluation-scientific-articles-other-sources-information-introduction-evidencebased-veterin-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2297000,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1614461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122806,"mean":8.6063181792274,"rank":62131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":44711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122806,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":582,"mean":1.7113907056799,"rank":159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":582,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.525,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
