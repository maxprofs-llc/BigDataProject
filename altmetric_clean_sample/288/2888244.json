Importantly, the personality traits and aspects of emotional adjustment that predict CHD are also related to marital quality. In such instances of correlated risk factors, traditional epidemiological and clinical research typically either ignores the potentially overlapping effects or examines independent associations through statistical controls, approaches that can misrepresent the key components and mechanisms of psychosocial effects on CHD. The interpersonal perspective in personality and clinical psychology provides an alternative and integrative approach, through its structural and process models of interpersonal behavior. We present this perspective on psychosocial risk and review research on its application to the integration of personality, emotional adjustment, and marital processes as closely interrelated influences on health and disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002eb3","authors":["Smith, Timothy W.","Baron, Carolynne E.","Grove, Jeremy L."],"doi":"10.1111\/jopy.12074","endpage":"514","first_seen_on":"2014-11-14T11:33:56+00:00","issns":["1467-6494","0022-3506"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Personality","last_mentioned_on":1415964749,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jopy.12074\/abstract?campaign=woletoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jopy.12074\/pdf","pmid":"24118013","pubdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"502","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Personality, Emotional Adjustment, and Cardiovascular Risk: Marriage as a Mechanism","type":"article","volume":"82","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/personality-emotional-adjustment-cardiovascular-risk-marriage-mechanism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6652724,"mean":6.1583722911633,"rank":5676678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6652724,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192285,"mean":7.6691043872608,"rank":152718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192285,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":561,"mean":11.140296428571,"rank":527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":561,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":9.1287272727273,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
