The quasi-experimental study compared effects of focusing on 'fear-based' stigma (stemming from lack of knowledge) versus both fear-based and social stigma (stemming from moral judgments). Interventions included staff training (ranging from physicians to ward cleaners), hospital policy development, and supplies provision. At baseline (n\u00a0=\u00a0795), reported stigma was substantial (e.g., about half of hospital workers indicated fear of casually touching PLHIV, and felt HIV was a punishment for bad behavior). By endline, stigma measures had improved significantly for both intervention groups (e.g., proportion reporting signs on beds indicating HIV status decreased from 51 to 24\u00a0% in Arm 1, and 31 to 7 % in Arm 2), with the combined intervention group showing greater effects. This study highlights successful strategies to reduce stigma, and thus, improve quality of care for PLHIV.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056e0","authors":["Pulerwitz J","Oanh KT","Akinwolemiwa D","Ashburn K","Nyblade L","Julie Pulerwitz","Khuat Thi Hai Oanh","Dayo Akinwolemiwa","Kim Ashburn","Laura Nyblade"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10461-014-0935-4","first_seen_on":"2014-11-14T15:50:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1090-7165","1573-3254"],"issue":"","journal":"AIDS & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1415980478,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25382350"],"pmid":"25382350","pubdate":"2014-11-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Health Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome","behavioralsciences"],"title":"Improving Hospital-Based Quality of Care by Reducing HIV-Related Stigma: Evaluation Results from Vietnam.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s10461-014-0935-4","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improving-hospitalbased-quality-care-reducing-hivrelated-stigma-evaluation-results-vietnam"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4504707,"mean":4.9856818325943,"rank":3182142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":1040297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4504707,"percentile":23},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122377,"mean":8.2993847159574,"rank":79956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":32065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122377,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1079,"mean":3.2886994434137,"rank":853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1079,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":3.7360465116279,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
