Escherichia coli, yeast, and phage display suffer from protein folding and viability issues. However, spores avoid folding concerns by the natural sporulation process, and they remain viable under harsh chemical and physical environment. The naturally occurring B. subtilis spore coat protein, CotA, was evolved for improved activity under conditions of high organic solvent concentrations. CotA is a laccase, which is copper-containing oxidase enzyme. A CotA library was expressed on the spore coat and approximately 3000 clones were screened at 60% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). A T480A variant (Thr480Ala-CotA) was identified that was 2.38 fold more active than the wild-type CotA. In addition, Thr480Ala-CotA was more active with varying concentrations of DMSO ranging from 0-70%. The mutant was also found to be more active compared to wild-type CotA in different concentrations methanol, ethanol and acetonitrile.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006813","authors":["Han Jia","Frederick S Lee","Edgardo T Farinas"],"doi":"10.1021\/co500113t","first_seen_on":"2014-11-14T12:51:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2156-8944"],"journal":"ACS Combinatorial Science","last_mentioned_on":1416237130,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25392937?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/co500113t"],"pmid":"25392937","pubdate":"2014-11-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Bacillus subtilis spore display of laccase for evolution under extreme conditions of high concentrations of organic solvent.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bacillus-subtilis-spore-display-laccase-evolution-under-extreme-conditions-high-concentrations-organ"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4517894,"mean":5.2830313263467,"rank":1995301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2501746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4517894,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122635,"mean":8.851123097999,"rank":50861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":71012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122635,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":2.2220327868852,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":5,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1,"GB":1},"mendeley":{"US":1,"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/status\/533240701593456640","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2888518],"posted_on":"2014-11-14T12:51:05+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
