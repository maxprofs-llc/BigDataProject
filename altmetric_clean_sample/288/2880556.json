A search of electronic databases was undertaken to identify all studies reporting on the outcome of the chimney technique. The selected articles were divided into those reporting on the treatment of aortic pathology involving the visceral and those involving the supra-aortic branches. Twenty-one articles reporting on the treatment of juxta\/supra-renal aorta and aortic arch disease in 102 and 37 patients, respectively, were identified. In the visceral group, an overall technical success rate of 91% was achieved, the perioperative major morbidity and mortality rates were 17 and 5%, respectively, and an early type I endoleak developed in 13 patients (13%). During follow-up, one patient died of intestinal ischemia. In the supra-aortic group, the technical success rate was recorded in 95%, and three patients (8%) developed an early type I endoleak. Three patients (13%) required conversion to open surgery during follow-up. In conclusion, this technique may be viewed as a complementary technique in high-surgical-risk patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c54","authors":["George A Antoniou","Andrew Schiro","Stavros A Antoniou","Finn Farquharson","David Murray","J Vincent Smyth","Ferdinand Serracino-Inglott","Antoniou GA","Schiro A","Antoniou SA","Farquharson F","Murray D","Smyth JV","Serracino-Inglott F"],"doi":"10.1258\/vasc.2011.ra0056","endpage":"261","first_seen_on":"2014-11-12T14:55:17+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1708-539X","1708-5381"],"issue":"5","journal":"Vascular","last_mentioned_on":1415829718,"links":["http:\/\/vas.sagepub.com\/content\/20\/5\/251.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/vas.sagepub.com\/content\/20\/5\/251.full.pdf","pmid":"22983540","pubdate":"2012-10-14T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"251","subjects":["generalsurgery","cardiology"],"title":"Chimney technique in the endovascular management of complex aortic disease","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chimney-technique-endovascular-management-complex-aortic-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4497175,"mean":4.7666293194958,"rank":3452419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":133212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4497175,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123144,"mean":7.588092071819,"rank":90865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":855,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123144,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":0.89649122807018,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.46875,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
