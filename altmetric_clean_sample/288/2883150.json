Among the various N-heterocyclic scaffolds, quinazolines and quinazolinones form a privileged class of compounds with their diverse spectrum of therapeutic potential. The easy generation of complex molecular diversity through broadly applicable, cost-effective, practical and sustainable synthetic methods in a straightforward fashion along with the importance of these motifs in medicinal chemistry, received significant attention from researchers engaged in drug design and heterocyclic methodology development. In this perspective, the current review article is an effort to recapitulate recent developments in the eco-friendly and green procedures for the construction of highly challenging and potentially bioactive quinazoline and quinazolinone compounds in order to help medicinal chemists in designing and synthesizing novel and potent compounds for the treatment of different disorders. The key mechanistic insights for the synthesis of these heterocycles along with potential applications and manipulations of the products have also been conferred. This article also aims to highlight the promising future directions for the easy access to these frameworks in addition to the identification of more potent and specific products for numerous biological targets.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000283d","doi":"10.1016\/j.ejmech.2014.10.084","first_seen_on":"2014-11-13T07:12:01+00:00","issns":["02235234"],"journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1416603531,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0223523414010216"],"pmid":"25461317","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Synthetic approaches, functionalization and therapeutic potential of quinazoline and quinazolinone skeletons: The advances continue\u2026 ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthetic-approaches-functionalization-therapeutic-potential-quinazoline-quinazolinone-skeletons-adv"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4534060,"mean":5.2893790400115,"rank":2932785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1433463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4534060,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123219,"mean":8.8328398610593,"rank":77548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":40326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123219,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":636,"mean":1.132642519685,"rank":255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":636,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":0.70232558139535,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
