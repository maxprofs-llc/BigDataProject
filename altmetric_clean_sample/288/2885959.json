This microbiota is relatively stable throughout adult life, but may fluctuate over time with aging and disease. The gut microbiota serves a number of functions including roles in energy provision, nutrition and also in the maintenance of host health such as protection against pathogens. This review summarizes the age-related changes in the microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the link between the gut microbiota in health and disease. Understanding the composition and function of the gut microbiota along with the changes it undergoes overtime should aid the design of novel therapeutic strategies to counteract such alterations. These strategies include probiotic and prebiotic preparations as well as targeted nutrients, designed to enrich the gut microbiota of the aging population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da9","authors":["B Lakshminarayanan","C Stanton","P W O'Toole","R P Ross"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12603-014-0513-5","first_seen_on":"2014-11-13T23:07:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1760-4788"],"issue":"9","journal":"The Journal of Nutrition Health and Aging","last_mentioned_on":1446731294,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25389954?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s12603-014-0513-5","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25389954","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25389954?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s12603-014-0513-5"],"pmid":"25389954","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Aging","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Geriatrics\/Gerontology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nutrition","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Primary Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Quality of Life Research","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["geriatrics","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Compositional dynamics of the human intestinal microbiota with aging: Implications for health","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/compositional-dynamics-human-intestinal-microbiota-aging-implications-health-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7987698,"mean":6.7357814927075,"rank":3720946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4088123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7987698,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198928,"mean":7.8953404414687,"rank":80396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":112095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198928,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":667,"mean":5.5028018018018,"rank":341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":667,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":18.666125,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
