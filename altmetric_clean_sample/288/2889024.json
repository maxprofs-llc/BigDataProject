A multifunctional cosmetic formulation containing an association of UV filters and antioxidant substances (liposoluble vitamins A, C and E, Ginkgo biloba and Phorphyra umbilicalis extracts) was evaluated. This formulation was submitted to a clinical efficacy study using biophysics techniques and skin images analysis (digital photography imaging systems, 20 MHz ultrasound, and reflectance confocal microscopy). The volunteers applied the formulation containing the UV filters and antioxidant substances during the day and the formulation with antioxidant substances and without the UV filters at night, for 90 days. The formulation increased the hydration and protected the skin barrier function after a single application. At the long term assessment the formulation provided an improvement in skin barrier function and skin hydration to the deeper layers of the epidermis, leading to an improvement in skin appearance by reducing wrinkles and skin roughness. The multifunctional cosmetic formulation studied can be suggested to preventing signs of aging and improving skin conditions. In addition, this study presents the benefits of associating different active antioxidants substances in a single cosmetic formulation to prevent skin aging.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Mirela D Gianeti","Patr\u00edcia M B G Maia Campos"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules191118268","first_seen_on":"2014-11-14T15:37:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"11","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1415979417,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25389659"],"pmid":"25389659","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Efficacy Evaluation of a Multifunctional Cosmetic Formulation: The Benefits of a Combination of Active Antioxidant Substances.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-evaluation-multifunctional-cosmetic-formulation-benefits-combination-active-antioxidant-sub"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4504707,"mean":4.9856818325943,"rank":3464434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":132913,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4504707,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122378,"mean":8.2994574470694,"rank":90319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122378,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1532,"mean":1.4284506858263,"rank":615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1532,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":3.4779473684211,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
