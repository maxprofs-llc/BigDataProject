The rats were subjected to fasting for 72 h every 2 weeks for 18 weeks. OGTT test was performed and fasting blood samples and fecal samples were collected for measurement of TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C and sequence analysis of fecal 16S rRNA V4 tags using Illumina. Gut microbial community structure was analyzed with QIIME and LEfSe.\nAfter the intervention, the body weight of the fasting rats was significantly lower than that in high-fat diet group (P<0.01). OGTT results suggested impairment of sugar tolerance in the fasting group, which showed a significantly larger AUC than compared with the high-fat diet group (P<0.05). Intermittent fasting significantly reduced blood HDL-C and LDL-C levels (P<0.05) and partially restored liver steatosis, and improved the gut microbiota by increasing the abundance of YS2, RF32 and Helicobacteraceae and reducing Lactobacillus, Roseburia, Erysipelotrichaceae and Ralstonia. Bradyrhizobiaceae was found to be positively correlated with CHOL and HDL-C, and RF39 was inversely correlated with the weight of the rats.\nIntermittent fasting can decrease the body weight and blood lipid levels and restore normal gut microbiota but can cause impairment of glucose metabolism in obese presenium rats.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9263cf058f61000dcfd","authors":["Rong, Zu-Hua","Liang, Shao-Cong","Lu, Jun-Qi","He, Yan","Luo, Yue-Mei","You, Chao","Xia, Geng-Hong","M, Prabhakar","Li, Pan","Zhou, Hong-Wei"],"first_seen_on":"2017-04-28T10:20:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1673-4254"],"issue":"4","journal":"Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao Journal of Southern Medical University","last_mentioned_on":1493821645,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28446391?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28446391"],"pmid":"28446391","pubdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Effect of intermittent fasting on physiology and gut microbiota in presenium rats].","type":"article","volume":"37"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150286,"mean":6.9044882123689,"rank":5899764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1960569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150286,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235635,"mean":12.704907466664,"rank":153074,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":68767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235635,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":352,"mean":1.0284045584046,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":352,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.0277777777778,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MicrobiomePaper\/statuses\/857899252273471488","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19662409],"posted_on":"2017-04-28T10:08:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Microbiome Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585212126173732865\/jEvg1KpB_normal.jpg","description":"The latest PubMed publications on Microbiome Research delivered direct to your Twitter Feed.
