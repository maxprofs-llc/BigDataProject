The condition is likely to occur in cases of violent trauma, seizures, or electric shock. Unrecognized dislocation with humeral head fracture affects joint function and humeral head vascularity and may lead to chronic instability, osteonecrosis, and osteoarthritis. A group of 12 patients, including 10 men and 2 women, with neglected locked posterior shoulder dislocation with a reverse Hill-Sachs lesion were treated with the modified McLaughlin technique. The added bone graft from the iliac crest was impacted in the defect and fixed with screws. Mean follow-up was 30 months (range, 24-48 months). The range of forward flexion was 150\u02da to 175\u02da (average, 165\u02da), external rotation ranged from 60\u02da to 80\u02da (average, 75\u02da), internal rotation ranged from 40\u02da to 60\u02da (average, 50\u02da), and average abduction was 150\u02da (range, 145\u02da-160\u02da). The modified University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) scoring system was used for postoperative clinical evaluation. Total UCLA scores immediately postoperatively ranged from 22 to 28 points (average, 26.5 points) and averaged 30 points (range, 28-33 points) at last follow-up. No recurrence of dislocation occurred during the follow-up period. Of the study patients, 10 returned to their previous job and 2 modified their manual work. The modified McLaughlin technique with added iliac crest bone graft to fill the defect and prevent humeral head deformity is a successful technique for the treatment of patients with chronic locked posterior shoulder dislocation.
