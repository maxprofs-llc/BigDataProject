They are often taken together so as to fully utilize their antifatigue and refreshing effects, respectively. Whether actually a drug-nutrient interaction exists between ginsenoside Re and B-complex vitamins is still unknown. The objective of this study was to simultaneously investigate the effect of B-complex vitamins on the antifatigue activity and bioavailability of ginsenoside Re after their oral administration. The study results will provide valuable theoretical guidance for the combined utilization of ginseng and B-complex vitamins.\nGinsenoside Re with or without B-complex vitamins was orally administered to mice to evaluate its antifatigue effects and to rats to evaluate its bioavailability. The antifatigue activity was evaluated by the weight-loaded swimming test and biochemical parameters, including hepatic glycogen, plasma urea nitrogen, and blood lactic acid. The concentration of ginsenoside Re in plasma was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.\nNo antifatigue effect of ginsenoside Re was noted when ginsenoside Re in combination with B-complex vitamins was orally administered to mice. B-complex vitamins caused to a reduction in the bioavailability of ginsenoside Re with the area under the concentration-time curve from zero to infinity markedly decreasing from 11,830.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02,366.47 h\u00b7ng\/mL to 890.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0372.94 h\u00b7ng\/mL.\nThe results suggested that there were pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-nutrient interactions between ginsenoside Re and B-complex vitamins. B-complex vitamins can significantly weaken the antifatigue effect and decrease the bioavailability of ginsenoside Re when simultaneously administered orally.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8f73cf058f61000c98f","authors":["Yin Bin Chen","Yu Fang Wang","Wei Hou","Ying Ping Wang","Sheng Yuan Xiao","Yang Yang Fu","Jia Wang","Si Wen Zheng","Pei He Zheng"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jgr.2016.03.006","first_seen_on":"2017-04-28T14:26:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["12268453"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Ginseng Research","last_mentioned_on":1492545305,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28413326?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmcid":"PMC5386126","pmid":"28413326","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Effect of B-complex vitamins on the antifatigue activity and bioavailability of ginsenoside Re after oral administration","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-bcomplex-vitamins-antifatigue-activity-bioavailability-ginsenoside-re-after-oral-administrati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082745,"mean":6.8630429413494,"rank":6997210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082745,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231704,"mean":12.634874619664,"rank":188272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231704,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":2.166625,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.18,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
