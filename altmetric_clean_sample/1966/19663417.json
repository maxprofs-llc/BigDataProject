However, the presence of Arcobacter spp. in vegetables very little is known, because most studies have focused on foods of animal origin. On the other hand, quinolones are considered as first-line drugs for the treatment of infection by campylobacteria in human patients, but few data are currently available about the resistance levels to these antibiotics among Arcobacter species. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the presence and diversity of arcobacters isolated from fresh vegetables such as lettuces, spinaches, chards and cabbages. Resistance to quinolones of the isolates was also investigated. One hundred fresh vegetables samples purchased from seven local retail markets in Valencia (Spain) during eight months were analysed. The study included 41 lettuces, 21 spinaches, 34 chards and 4 cabbages. Samples were analysed by culture and by molecular methods before and after enrichment. By culture, 17 out of 100 analysed samples were Arcobacter positive and twenty-five isolates were obtained from them. Direct detection by PCR was low, with only 4% Arcobacter spp. positive samples. This percentage increased considerably, up 20%, after 48\u00a0h enrichment. By polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), 17 out of the 25 isolates were identified as A.\u00a0butzleri and 8 as A.\u00a0cryaerophilus. Only two A.\u00a0butzleri isolates showed resistance to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. The sequencing of a fragment of the QRDR region of the gyrA gene from the quinolones-resistant isolates revealed the presence of a mutation in position 254 of this gene (C-T transition). This study is the first report about the presence of pathogenic species of Arcobacter spp. in chards and cabbages and confirms that fresh vegetables can act as transmission vehicle to humans. Moreover, the presence of A.\u00a0butzleri quinolone resistant in vegetables could pose a potential public health risk.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f8","authors":["Ana Gonz\u00e1lez","Isidro Favi\u00e1n Bayas Morej\u00f3n","Mar\u00eda Antonia Ferr\u00fas"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fm.2017.02.011","first_seen_on":"2017-04-28T10:47:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["07400020"],"journal":"Food Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1493375626,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28400014?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28400014","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Isolation, molecular identification and quinolone-susceptibility testing of Arcobacter spp. isolated from fresh vegetables in Spain","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isolation-molecular-identification-quinolonesusceptibility-testing-arcobacter-spp-isolated-fresh-veg"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8138092,"mean":6.879675480889,"rank":7047544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8138092,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234604,"mean":12.679432547751,"rank":190881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234604,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":690,"mean":3.6717619738752,"rank":496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":690,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":4.2241463414634,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AntibioticResis\/statuses\/857905672658108416","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19663417],"posted_on":"2017-04-28T10:33:46+00:00","author":{"name":"AntibioticResistance","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/551766191962746880\/GlO2QteM_normal.jpeg","description":"Keep abreast of the latest developments in the fight against Antibiotic Resistance #AMR with the latest publications curated from PubMed.
