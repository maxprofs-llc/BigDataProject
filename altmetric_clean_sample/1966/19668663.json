A tartrate resistant acid phosphatase stain (TRAP) was used to indicate osteoclast formation and activity assessed by determining area of dentine resorption.\nThe combination of all components as is found in OST suppressed both osteoclast formation and activity. The yeast extract suppressed osteoclast activity at similar levels to that observed with all components combined.\nOur findings indicate that yeast RNA extracts found in OST may be the key component responsible for suppression of osteoclast activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aca","authors":["Melissa D.
