We hypothesized that measurement of neurofilament light protein (NF-L), a protein found in long white-matter axons, in blood samples, may serve as a suitable biomarker for neuronal damage in TBI patients. To test our hypotheses, we designed a study in two parts: i) we developed an immunoassay based on Single molecule array technology for quantification of NF-L in blood, and ii) in a proof-of-concept study, we tested our newly developed method on serial serum samples from severe TBI (sTBI) patients (n\u2009=\u200972) and controls (n\u2009=\u200935). We also compared the diagnostic and prognostic utility of NF-L with the established blood biomarker S100B. NF-L levels were markedly increased in sTBI patients compared with controls. NF-L at admission yielded an AUC of 0.99 to detect TBI versus controls (AUC 0.96 for S100B), and increased to 1.00 at day 12 (0.65 for S100B). Importantly, initial NF-L levels predicted poor 12-month clinical outcome. In contrast, S100B was not related to outcome. Taken together, our data suggests that measurement of serum NF-L may be useful to assess the severity of neuronal injury following sTBI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Shahim, Pashtun","Gren, Magnus","Liman, Victor","Andreasson, Ulf","Norgren, Niklas","Tegner, Yelverton","Mattsson, Niklas","Andreasen, Niels","\u00d6st, Martin","Zetterberg, Henrik","Nellg\u00e5rd, Bengt","Blennow, Kaj","Shahim, P","Gren, M","Liman, V","Andreasson, U","Norgren, N","Tegner, Y","Mattsson, N","Andreasen, N","Ost, M","Zetterberg, H","Nellgard, B","Blennow, K"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep36791","first_seen_on":"2016-11-11T23:25:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1485514237,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27819296","http:\/\/discovery.ucl.ac.uk\/1537467\/"],"pmid":"27819296","pubdate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neuroscience","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"White matter injury","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"36791","subjects":["science"],"title":"Serum neurofilament light protein predicts clinical outcome in traumatic brain injury","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep36791","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serum-neurofilament-light-protein-predicts-clinical-outcome-traumatic-brain-injury-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":9.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8133552,"mean":6.8851399141579,"rank":895301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7226454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8133552,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236296,"mean":13.158575458642,"rank":41923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":193674,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236296,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33640,"mean":14.882613632986,"rank":6816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":26682,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33640,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2951,"mean":17.615873220339,"rank":707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":2227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2951,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
