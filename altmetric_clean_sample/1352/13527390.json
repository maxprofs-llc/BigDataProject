In this respect, both amyloid production and aggregation may be stimulated by oxidative stress and also the increase of pathogenic \u03b2-amyloid and its aggregated form lead to oxidative stress progression. Therefore, the search for potential drugs with both antioxidant and anti-aggregation properties are of great interest. In this study, we described the stereospecific synthesis of alkaloid securinine aminoderivatives, and showed that the newly synthesized compounds possess antioxidant and metal-chelating properties. Indeed, we report that one compound has inhibitory effects towards \u03b2-amyloid aggregation. Based on these results, aminoderivatives of securinine scaffold are promising compounds for development of new drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002584","authors":["Neganova, Margarita E","Klochkov, Sergei G","Petrova, Ludmila N","Shevtsova, Elena","Afanasieva, Svetlana V","Chudinova, Ekaterina S","Fisenko, Vladimir P","Bachurin, Sergei O","Barreto, George E","Aliev, Gjumrakch"],"first_seen_on":"2016-11-11T23:26:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1996-3181"],"journal":"CNS & Neurological Disorders - Drug Targets","last_mentioned_on":1478906116,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27823572"],"pmid":"27823572","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Securinine derivatives as potential anti-amyloid therapeutic approach.","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7679268,"mean":6.5932591477757,"rank":1058005,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6552803,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7679268,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230579,"mean":12.948292872694,"rank":49389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":177868,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230579,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":472,"mean":4.5344076433121,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":472,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":22.875,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Securinine derivatives as potential anti-amyloid therapeutic approach.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=28579240603&p=1pl&v=1&x=iIhOC6lDY3tcHDq0CsQ0fw","license":"public","citation_ids":[13527390],"posted_on":"2016-11-11T23:15:16+00:00","summary":"Neganova ME, Klochkov SG, Petrova LN, Shevtsova E, Afanasieva SV, Chudinova ES, Fisenko VP, Bachurin SO, Barreto GE, Aliev G.","author":{"name":"Alzforum","url":"http:\/\/www.alzforum.org","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/355\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-04-08_at_12.16.09_1.png?1428491784"}}]}}
