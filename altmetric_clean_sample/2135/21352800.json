How \u201cAbortion Is Murder\u201d Became Institutionalized in El Salvador"],"citation":{"abstract":"Using the case of El Salvador, this article demonstrates how the anti-abortion catchphrase \"abortion is murder\" can become embedded in the legal practice of state judicial systems. In the 1990s, a powerful anti-abortion movement in El Salvador resulted in a new legal context that outlawed abortion in all circumstances, discouraged mobilization for abortion rights, and encouraged the prosecution of reproduction-related \"crimes.\" Within this context, Salvadoran women initially charged with the crime of abortion were convicted of \"aggravated homicide\" and sentenced to up to 40 years in prison. Court documents suggest that many of these women had not undergone abortions, but had suffered naturally occurring stillbirths late in their pregnancies. Through analysis of newspaper articles and court cases, this article documents how El Salvador came to prosecute obstetrical emergencies as \"murder,\" and concludes that activism on behalf of abortion rights is central to protecting poor pregnant women from prosecution for reproduction-related \"crimes.\"","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f6100075e4","authors":["Jocelyn Viterna","Jose Santos Guardado Bautista"],"first_seen_on":"2017-06-26T16:25:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2150-4113"],"issue":"1","journal":"Health and Human Rights","last_mentioned_on":1502971976,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5473040\/"],"pmid":"28630543","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Harvard University Press & Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Law","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"startpage":"81","subjects":["publichealth","ethics","socialsciences"],"title":"Pregnancy and the 40-Year Prison Sentence: How \"Abortion Is Murder\" Became Institutionalized in the Salvadoran Judicial System.","type":"article","volume":"19"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.1,"score_history":{"1y":9.1,"6m":9.1,"3m":9.1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":966932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7420564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234824,"mean":12.911374056204,"rank":41581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":193131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234824,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":2.8553076923077,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":4.8,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":14,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":14,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IE":2,"US":6,"NL":1,"ES":1,"UY":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/WomenHelpOrg\/statuses\/879374951161135105","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21352800],"posted_on":"2017-06-26T16:25:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Women Help Women","url":"http:\/\/www.WomenHelp.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/508321801558978560\/FM7tNbaq_normal.jpeg","description":"Abortion pills and contraceptive access worldwide, by post to your home.
