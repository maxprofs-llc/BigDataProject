Rather than attempting yet another defence of cognitive neuropsychology on logical grounds, we point out through examples that in practice, cognitive neuropsychological evidence is widely accepted as valid and important, and has had a major impact on cognitive theory and research. Objections offered in the abstract rarely arise in the context of actual studies. We develop these points through examples from the domain of vision, discussing cerebral achromatopsia and akinetopsia, selective impairment and sparing of face recognition, perception-action dissociations, and blindsight.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f610001548","authors":["Michael McCloskey","Thitaporn Chaisilprungraung","McCloskey, Michael","Chaisilprungraung, Thitaporn"],"doi":"10.1080\/02643294.2017.1342618","first_seen_on":"2017-06-27T00:53:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0264-3294","1464-0627"],"journal":"Cognitive Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1499299200,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/02643294.2017.1342618?af=R","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28649924\/?i=6&from=neuropsychological","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/02643294.2017.1342618"],"pmid":"28649924","pubdate":"2017-06-27T09:33:42+00:00","publisher":"Routledge","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychology","neurology"],"title":"The value of cognitive neuropsychology: The case of vision research","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/value-cognitive-neuropsychology-case-vision-research"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166903,"mean":6.9134132553505,"rank":3847027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4138143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166903,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191255,"mean":11.730981950704,"rank":86416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":98861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191255,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":349,"mean":6.183867816092,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":349,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":7.8125,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
