These substances are important sources of new lead compounds. Pelorol is a natural product isolated from marine organisms that possesses a novel structure with high bioactivity. In this paper, the synthesis of pelorol has been completed, and the synthesis of some intermediates has been optimized and scaled up. Five pelorol analogs have also been prepared. Preliminary biological activity testing demonstrated that compounds 5 and 6 might be potential lead compounds for cancer therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f61000668a","authors":["Yongjie Luo"],"doi":"10.3390\/md14060118","first_seen_on":"2016-06-22T00:21:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1660-3397"],"issue":"6","journal":"Marine Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1466554899,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/14\/6\/118"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/14\/6\/118\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4926077","pmid":"27338420","pubdate":"2016-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["biology","pharmacology"],"title":"Synthesis of Pelorol and Its Analogs and Their Inhibitory Effects on Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-pelorol-analogs-inhibitory-effects-phosphatidylinositol-3kinase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7931561,"mean":6.7081498191978,"rank":6014232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1065712,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7931561,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262170,"mean":11.566703790303,"rank":183655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262170,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1008,"mean":3.5401966236346,"rank":714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1008,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":3.5793870967742,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Lecturer":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Sports and Recreations":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Environmental Science":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Marine_Drugs\/statuses\/745411391486496768","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8957320],"posted_on":"2016-06-22T00:21:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Marine Drugs_MDPI","url":"https:\/\/t.co\/qFW8OaUMfh","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/642171701116071936\/zNYS3NbE_normal.png","description":"An open access journal on the research, development, and production of  drugs from the sea, including marine natural product chemistry.","id_on_source":"Marine_Drugs","tweeter_id":"3616087756","followers":183},"tweet_id":"745411391486496768"}]}}
