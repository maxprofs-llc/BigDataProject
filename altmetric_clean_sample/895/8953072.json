Self-report measures of maternal anxiety and depression were assessed at repeated intervals in pregnancy and the postnatal period. Children's behavioral\/emotional problems were assessed by parent report at age 4 years.\nAfter controlling for smoking, alcohol use, birth weight for gestational age, maternal age, child sex, and socioeconomic status, postnatal depression at 8 weeks (OR = 2.27 [1.55-3.31]) and 8 months (OR = 1.68 [1.12-2.54]) was associated with children's behavioral\/emotional problems. Subsequent analyses that included antenatal maternal mood indicated that antenatal anxiety in late pregnancy and not antenatal depression was also independently associated with behavioral\/emotional problems at age 4 (OR = 1.72 [1.14-2.59]); 8 week postnatal depression remained a significant predictor after antenatal maternal mood was statistically controlled for (OR = 1.56 [1.04-2.32]).\nAntenatal anxiety and postnatal depression represent separate risks for behavioral\/emotional problems in children and act in an additive manner.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f53","authors":["THOMAS G.
