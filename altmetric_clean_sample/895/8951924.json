We investigated the biological involvement of miR-301a in osteosarcoma (OS). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze expression levels of miR-301a in 24 OS and matched adjacent non-tumor tissues. A miR-301a mimic was transferred into OS cell lines U-2 OS and MG-63 to upregulate miR-301a. The effects of miR-301a were investigated by examining cell proliferation, migration, and the cell cycle. The miR-301 target was predicted by TargetScan and confirmed by western blotting and qRT-PCR. The expression of miR-301a was significantly higher in OS tissues compared with the matched adjacent non-tumor tissues (0.959 \u00b1 0.39 vs 3.9516 \u00b1 1.18). Upregulated miR-301a significantly increased proliferation at 48 and 72 h compared to the negative control (U-2 OS: 2.11 \u00b1 0.21 vs 2.88 \u00b1 0.24; 2.70 \u00b1 0.26 vs 3.71 \u00b1 0.24; MG-63: 2.19 \u00b1 0.20 vs 3.19 \u00b1 0.22; 3.1 \u00b1 0.25 vs 4.01 \u00b1 0.27) and migration capability (U-2 OS: 100 \u00b1 20.19 vs 150.68 \u00b1 32.83; MG-63: 100 \u00b1 17.20 vs 133.35 \u00b1 26.26), and decreased apoptosis in both U-2 OS (10.87 \u00b1 2.53 vs 4.01 \u00b1 2.23) and MG-63 (15.26 \u00b1 2.15 vs 8.25 \u00b1 3.07). The cell cycle studies revealed that miR-301a caused an increase of the G2 population in U-2 OS (38.6 \u00b1 6.58 vs 47.2 \u00b1 7.27) and MG-63 (44.01 \u00b1 5.28 vs 57.9 \u00b1 4.25). Additional experiments indicated that CDC14A was upregulated by miR-301a (0.63 \u00b1 0.06 vs 0.98 \u00b1 0.06; 1.49 \u00b1 0.25 vs 2.99 \u00b1 0.14). Overexpressed miR-301a may increase CDC14A expression and promote cell proliferation and migration in OS cells. Therefore, miR- 301a may be useful for osteosarcoma diagnosis and therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f610007523","authors":["Ni, Z","Shang, X F","Wang, Y F","Sun, Y J","Fu, D J"],"doi":"10.4238\/gmr.15027807","first_seen_on":"2016-06-21T16:09:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1676-5680","16765680"],"issue":"2","journal":"Genetics and Molecular Research","last_mentioned_on":1466525349,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27323075?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27323075","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","genetics"],"title":"Upregulated microRNA-301a in osteosarcoma promotes tumor progression by targeting CDC14A","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/upregulated-microrna301a-osteosarcoma-promotes-tumor-progression-targeting-cdc14a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7926939,"mean":6.7044594278339,"rank":6861711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7926939,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262698,"mean":11.54693146096,"rank":219979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262698,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1505,"mean":0.85909840425532,"rank":946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1505,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.34375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/745287451325849604","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8951924],"posted_on":"2016-06-21T16:09:09+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
