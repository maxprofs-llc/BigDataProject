We used Illumina MiSeq\u00ae to track changes in must fungal community composition over time in winery vats and laboratory microcosms. We also measured glucose consumption and biomass in microcosms derived directly from must, and glucose consumption in artificially assembled microcosms. Functional impacts of individual must yeasts in artificially assembled communities were calculated using a \"keystone index,\" developed for \"Species richness influences wine ecosystem function through a dominant species\" [1]. Community composition data and functional measurements are included in this article. DNA sequences were deposited in GenBank (GenBank: SRP073276). Discussion of must succession and ecosystem functioning in must are provided in [1].","altmetric_jid":"55b0f0292a83ee6a598b456b","authors":["Boynton, PJ","Boynton, Primrose J","Greig, Duncan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.dib.2016.05.038","endpage":"229","first_seen_on":"2016-06-21T16:12:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["23523409","2352-3409"],"journal":"Data in Brief","last_mentioned_on":1466705640,"links":["http:\/\/discovery.ucl.ac.uk\/1500867\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27331092?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2352340916303262"],"pmcid":"PMC4900889","pmid":"27331092","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"225","title":"Fungal diversity and ecosystem function data from wine fermentation vats and microcosms","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fungal-diversity-ecosystem-function-data-wine-fermentation-vats-microcosms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7936934,"mean":6.7106933012983,"rank":987902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":6944390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7936934,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262810,"mean":11.548214695843,"rank":46444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":215893,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262810,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":420,"mean":2.0513747016706,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":420,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":1.4560266666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":6,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1,"US":1},"mendeley":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ucl_discovery\/statuses\/745288215091908608","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8951984],"posted_on":"2016-06-21T16:12:11+00:00","author":{"name":"UCL Discovery","url":"http:\/\/discovery.ucl.ac.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/631451975817805824\/GfvbIz0w_normal.png","description":"UCL Discovery is a central open access showcase of UCL research.
