A secondary data analysis was conducted on a total sample of 6,525 Mexicans 60 years and older.\nFindings indicate that depressive symptoms among older people derive from their limitations in mobility rather than from their age.\nIn Mexico, the prevalence of major depressive disorders is higher among older adults than among the rest of the adults. Hence, as the prevalence of this problem grows, the need for appropriate mental health attention will increase in Mexico.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f610005942","authors":["Esteban Picazzo-Palencia"],"doi":"10.1177\/1540415316650846","first_seen_on":"2016-06-21T17:51:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1938-8993"],"issue":"2","journal":"Hispanic health care international (Online)","last_mentioned_on":1466530830,"links":["http:\/\/hci.sagepub.com\/content\/14\/2\/94.abstract?utm_source=SAGE_social&hootPostID=710def91dbfebac89dc23fe5a0ce3256"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hci.sagepub.com\/content\/14\/2\/94.full.pdf","pmid":"27257223","pubdate":"2016-06-22T22:27:48+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"title":"Depression and Mobility Among Older Adults in Mexico: ENSANUT 2012.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/depression-mobility-among-older-adults-mexico-ensanut-2012"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7926939,"mean":6.7044594278339,"rank":6861709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7926939,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262697,"mean":11.546954670036,"rank":219978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262697,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":3.3869565217391,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":6.8,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":2,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SAGEHealthInfo\/statuses\/745310437781159937","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8953128],"posted_on":"2016-06-21T17:40:30+00:00","author":{"name":"SAGE Health Research","url":"http:\/\/www.sagepublications.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/718100077592510464\/zQZ3LXeN_normal.jpg","description":"Follow us for the latest research on SAGE Publishing public health and health services, as well as general news items of interest.","id_on_source":"SAGEHealthInfo","tweeter_id":"338930010","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3453},"tweet_id":"745310437781159937"}]}}
