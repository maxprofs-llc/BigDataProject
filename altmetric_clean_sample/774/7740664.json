Recent studies have reported good results with platelet rich plasma. However, corticosteroids are the most common treatment used in Mexico.\nTo conduct a comparative study to determine which treatment provides better results (platelet rich plasma versus corticosteroids).\nPatients were randomized into two groups. Group A was treated with a single administration of platelet rich plasma and group B with a single dose of 40 mg of methylprednisolone. Patients were assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) and the Quick DASH scale, applied before the procedure, and at one, three and six months.\nThe results were compared with an analysis using the Student t test. One month after treatment the patients had improvement with no significant difference between both groups. At three months results were better with platelet rich plasma; however, at six months improvement with the latter declined slightly.\nThe results show that platelet rich plasma provided better results from the perspective of pain control and effect duration. However, the number of applications and the possibility of improving the outcomes if combined with rehabilitation have not yet been determined.","altmetric_jid":"56a768e12a83eeb12a8b4918","authors":["Mart\u00ednez-Montiel, O","Valencia-Martinez, G","Blanco-Bucio, P","Villalobos-Campuzano, C"],"first_seen_on":"2016-05-19T20:26:08+00:00","issns":["2306-4102"],"issue":"3","journal":"Acta ortop\u00e9dica mexicana","last_mentioned_on":1463689552,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26999966"],"pmid":"26999966","pubdate":"2015-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"[Treatment of elbow epicondylitis with platelet rich plasma versus local corticosteroids].","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tratamiento-epicondilitis-codo-con-plasma-rico-en-plaquetas-versus-corticosteroide-local"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7719347,"mean":6.622418915792,"rank":5837756,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1041194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7719347,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269213,"mean":11.50543310105,"rank":188318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269213,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.84166666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":4},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ReumaHUSC\/statuses\/733393255895838725","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7740664],"posted_on":"2016-05-19T20:25:52+00:00","author":{"name":"Reumatek","url":"http:\/\/www.reumatek.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/837413968406794240\/vcHmxomY_normal.jpg","description":"Rheumatology Unit from Hospital Universitari Sagrat Cor + Teknon Medical Center (Barcelona)\ud83c\udfe5.
