Identifying novel biomarkers that predict ARB response may help tailor therapy. We aimed to discover and validate a serum metabolite classifier that predicts albuminuria response to ARBs in patients with diabetes mellitus and micro- or macroalbuminuria.\nLiquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics was performed on serum samples. Data from patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria (n\u00a0=\u00a049) treated with irbesartan 300\u00a0mg\/day were used for discovery. LASSO and ridge regression were performed to develop the classifier. Improvement in albuminuria response prediction was assessed by calculating differences in R(2) between a reference model of clinical parameters and a model with clinical parameters and the classifier. The classifier was externally validated in patients with type 1 diabetes and macroalbuminuria (n\u00a0=\u00a050) treated with losartan 100\u00a0mg\/day. Molecular process analysis was performed to link metabolites to molecular mechanisms contributing to ARB response.\nIn discovery, median change in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was -42\u00a0% [Q1-Q3: -69 to -8]. The classifier, consisting of 21 metabolites, was significantly associated with UAE response to irbesartan (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and improved prediction of UAE response on top of the clinical reference model (R(2) increase from 0.10 to 0.70; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In external validation, median change in UAE was -43\u00a0% [Q1-Q35: -63 to -23]. The classifier improved prediction of UAE response to losartan (R(2) increase from 0.20 to 0.59; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Specifically ADMA impacting eNOS activity appears to be a relevant factor in ARB response.\nA serum metabolite classifier was discovered and externally validated to significantly improve prediction of albuminuria response to ARBs in diabetes mellitus.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000865","authors":["Michelle J.
