However, our understanding of the mechanisms regulating post-prandial fatty acid transporter subcellular location remains limited. We demonstrate that the response of fatty acid transporters to insulin stimulation is extremely brief and not temporally matched in the post-prandial state. We further show that high-fat diet-induced accumulation of fatty acid transporters on the plasma membrane can occur in the absence of insulin. Altogether, these data suggest that insulin is not the primary signal regulating fatty acid transporter relocation in vivo. This article is protected by copyright.
