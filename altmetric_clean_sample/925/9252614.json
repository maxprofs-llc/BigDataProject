However, the clinicopathological features and pathogenesis of HCC with steatosis is not well characterized. There is little data concerning whether HCC with steatosis should be regarded a distinct histological variant, steatotic HCC.\nA retrospective cohort of 516 patients undergoing curative surgery for primary HCC was recruited. The median follow-up was 45.5 (range: 0.2 to 166.0) months. Steatotic HCC was defined as HCC with significant steatosis (\u22655% of tumor cells). Associations with immunohistochemical expression of fatty acid binding protein-1 (FABP1) and sonic hedgehog (SHH), and gene polymorphism of patatin-like phospholipase 3 (PNPLA3) were analyzed. Steatotic HCC was found in 21.1% of patients and was associated with higher metabolic risks [diabetes mellitus (36.7% vs. 18.2%) and hypertension (44.0% vs. 28.7%)], underlying fatty liver (60.6% vs. 37.8%), steatohepatitis (30.3% vs. 13.0%), smaller tumor size, lower frequency of major vessel (1.8% vs. 11.3%) and microvascular invasion (20.2% vs 32.4%), earlier tumor stages, and lower serum alpha-fetoprotein. It was associated with developing late tumor relapse (hazard ratio 2.15, P=0.002) independently of underlying cirrhosis and non-anatomical excision. Steatotic HCC did not differ from HCC without significant steatosis in immunohistochemical expression of FABP1 and SHH, and PNPLA3 gene polymorphism.\nSteatotic HCC is a common histological variant of HCC with distinct association with underlying fatty liver, steatohepatitis and metabolic risks. Despite more favorable baseline tumor features, it was associated with late tumor relapse. This article is protected by copyright.
