This retrospective study investigated the relationship between exposure to different noise frequencies and the incidence of hypertension. A cohort of 1,002 volunteers from 4 machinery and equipment manufacturing companies in Taichung, Taiwan, was followed from 1973 to 2012. Personal noise measurements and environmental octave-band analyses were performed to divide subjects into different exposure groups. Cox regression models were used to estimate the relative risk of hypertension. Participants exposed to \u226580 A-weighted decibels (dBA) over 8 years had a higher relative risk of hypertension (relative risk = 1.38, 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.85) compared with those exposed to <75 dBA. Significant exposure-response patterns were observed between incident hypertension and stratum of noise exposure at frequencies of 250 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz, and 8 kHz. The strongest effect was found at 4 kHz; a 20-dBA increase in noise exposure at 4 kHz was associated with a 34% higher risk of hypertension (relative risk = 1.34, 95% confidence interval: 1.01, 1.77). Occupational noise exposure may be associated with an increased risk of hypertension, and the 4 kHz component of occupational noise exposure may have the strongest relationship with hypertension.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f7","authors":["Chiu-Shong Liu","Li-Hao Young","Tzu-Yi Yu","Bo-Ying Bao","Ta-Yuan Chang"],"doi":"10.1093\/aje\/kwv333","first_seen_on":"2016-07-05T18:16:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-6256"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal of Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1467978320,"links":["http:\/\/m.aje.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/30\/aje.kwv333.abstract","http:\/\/aje.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/30\/aje.kwv333.abstract?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/aje.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/30\/aje.kwv333.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/aje.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/30\/aje.kwv333.full.pdf","pmid":"27370792","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"kwv333","subjects":["epidemiology"],"title":"Occupational Noise Frequencies and the Incidence of Hypertension in a Retrospective Cohort Study","type":"article","volume":"184","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/occupational-noise-frequencies-incidence-hypertension-retrospective-cohort-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029085,"mean":6.8046097213542,"rank":3645060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4304304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029085,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260589,"mean":11.563477174697,"rank":112708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":143388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260589,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5848,"mean":9.4005702069437,"rank":4763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":1046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5848,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":44.92120754717,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
