However, the evaluation of immunotoxicity of engine exhausts is currently based on expensive and time-consuming experiments. It is desirable to develop efficient methods for immunotoxicity assessment.\nTo accelerate the development of safe alternative fuels, this study proposed a computational method for identifying informative features for predicting proinflammatory potentials of engine exhausts. A principal component regression (PCR) algorithm was applied to develop prediction models. The informative features were identified by a sequential backward feature elimination (SBFE) algorithm.\nA total of 19 informative chemical and biological features were successfully identified by SBFE algorithm. The informative features were utilized to develop a computational method named FS-CBM for predicting proinflammatory potentials of engine exhausts. FS-CBM model achieved a high performance with correlation coefficient values of 0.997 and 0.943 obtained from training and independent test sets, respectively.\nThe FS-CBM model was developed for predicting proinflammatory potentials of engine exhausts with a large improvement on prediction performance compared with our previous CBM model. The proposed method could be further applied to construct models for bioactivities of mixtures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007e2","authors":["Chia-Chi Wang","Ying-Chi Lin","Yuan-Chung Lin","Syu-Ruei Jhang","Chun-Wei Tung","Chia-Chi Wang","Ying-Chi Lin","Yuan-Chung Lin","Syu-Ruei Jhang","Chun-Wei Tung"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12938-017-0355-6","first_seen_on":"2017-08-23T00:44:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1475-925X"],"issue":"1","journal":"BioMedical Engineering OnLine","last_mentioned_on":1503449078,"links":["https:\/\/biomedical-engineering-online.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12938-017-0355-6"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/biomedical-engineering-online.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12938-017-0355-6?site=biomedical-engineering-online.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28830522","pubdate":"2017-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomaterials","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering\/Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"66","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Identification of informative features for predicting proinflammatory potentials of engine exhausts","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-informative-features-predicting-proinflammatory-potentials-engine-exhausts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":4496273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2344204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169950,"mean":12.724805159195,"rank":93191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":59726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169950,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":440,"mean":2.6502095671982,"rank":166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":440,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":3.2769230769231,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Environmental Science":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"TW":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/wewey520\/statuses\/900156793971539968","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24198490],"posted_on":"2017-08-23T00:44:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Chun-Wei Tung","url":"http:\/\/cwtung.kmu.edu.tw","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/822324003918331904\/zMWk55cC_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"wewey520","tweeter_id":"365893156","geo":{"lt":22.61626,"ln":120.31333,"country":"TW"},"followers":8},"tweet_id":"900156793971539968"}]}}
