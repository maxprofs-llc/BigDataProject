Experimental and simulation results suggest that when CO2 is introduced, pH drops immediately that initiates release of As from clay minerals. Calcite dissolution can increase pH slightly and cause As re-adsorption. Thus, the mineralogy of the USDW is ultimately a determining factor of arsenic fate and transport. Salient results suggest that: (1) As desorption\/adsorption from\/onto clay minerals is the major reaction controlling its mobilization, and clay minerals could mitigate As mobilization with surface complexation reactions; (2) dissolution of available calcite plays a critical role in buffering pH; (3) high salinity in general hinders As release from minerals; and (4) the magnitude and quantitative uncertainty of As mobilization are predicated on the values of reaction rates and surface area of calcite, adsorption surface areas and equilibrium constants of clay minerals, and cation exchange capacity. Results of this study are intended to improve ability to quantify risks associated with potential leakage of reservoir fluids into shallow aquifers, in particular the possible environmental impacts of As mobilization at carbon sequestration sites.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Ting Xiao","Zhenxue Dai","Hari Viswanathan","Alexandra Hakala","Martha Cather","Wei Jia","Yongchao Zhang","Brian McPherson"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-02849-z","first_seen_on":"2017-06-05T09:05:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1496653536,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-02849-z?WT.feed_name=subjects_climate-sciences"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-02849-z.pdf","pmid":"28584255","pubdate":"2017-06-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"2763","subjects":["science"],"title":"Arsenic mobilization in shallow aquifers due to CO2 and brine intrusion from storage reservoirs","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/arsenic-mobilization-shallow-aquifers-due-co2-brine-intrusion-storage-reservoirs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":7193872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241550,"mean":12.288937697941,"rank":196813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241550,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36267,"mean":14.715640269123,"rank":30315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36267,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3055,"mean":14.997117223314,"rank":2444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3055,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/geomatlab\/statuses\/871654224416956417","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20825627],"posted_on":"2017-06-05T09:05:36+00:00","author":{"name":"POPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/526965085525123074\/gaDqeOsT_normal.jpeg","description":"PhysicalOceanography Papers auto-shared: ARMS NPG JC JPO GRL JGR PO JMS OD CSR DSR1 DSR2 JFM DAO OM OS TA    Powered by RSS2Twitter@IFTTT.
