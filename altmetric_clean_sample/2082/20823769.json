This article notes key advances in understanding of immune dysregulation, skin barrier dysfunction, environmental, genetic, and microbial influences orchestrating disease pathogenesis, and the relevance of therapeutic interventions in each area. Accumulating evidence and the discovery of new T-cell subsets has matured AD as a multiple-cytokine-axes-driven disorder, evolved from the widely held belief of it being a biphasic Th1\/Th2 disease. These new insights have led to active trials testing multiple, targeted therapeutics with better efficacy and safety-profiles.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000587f","authors":["Kunal Malik","Kerry D.
