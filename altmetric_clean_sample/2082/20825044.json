We describe the application of Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) technology to elucidate the mechanism-of-action of small molecules at the post-translational pathway level. We propose that profiling of phenotypic hits and lead molecules in increasingly more complex 3D in vitro and ex vivo models at the post-translational pathway network level represents an effective strategy to both triage and progress the preclinical development of phenotypic screening hits.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6153cf058f610007176","authors":["Pawlak, Michael","Neil Carragher"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ddtec.2017.05.002","first_seen_on":"2017-06-05T08:24:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"10.1016\/j.ddtec.2017.05.002","handles":["10.1016\/j.ddtec.2017.05.002"],"issns":["1740-6749","17406749"],"journal":"Drug Discovery Today: Technologies","last_mentioned_on":1496651059,"links":["http:\/\/www.research.ed.ac.uk\/portal\/en\/publications\/reverse-phase-protein-arrays-elucidate-mechanismsofaction-and-phenotypic-response-in-2d-and-3d-models(63ccee46-0af2-46e2-bfd8-48263546b603).html"],"pmid":"28647089","pubdate":"2017-06-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Reverse Phase Protein Arrays elucidate mechanisms-of-action and phenotypic response in 2D and 3D models","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reverse-phase-protein-arrays-elucidate-mechanismsofaction-phenotypic-response-2d-3d-models"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":4431721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2315922,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241550,"mean":12.288951980757,"rank":133408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":85455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241550,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":2.3620215053763,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nailest_papers\/statuses\/871643837579571200","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20825044],"posted_on":"2017-06-05T08:24:19+00:00","author":{"name":"andy","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"Experimenting with automatically posting links to academic papers of interest, mostly from rss feeds via ifttt.
