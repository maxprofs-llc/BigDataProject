The persons from the NW group completed a 12-week Nordic Walking training program (3 times a week\/1 hour). PPTs measurements in selected muscles and functional tests evaluating upper-body flexibility (Back Scratch - BS) were carried out twice in every participant of the study: before and after the training program.\nA significant increase in PPT (kg\/cm2) was observed in the following muscles in the NW group only: upper trapezius (from 1,32\u200akg\/cm2 to 1,99\u200akg\/cm2), mid trapezius (from 2,92\u200akg\/cm2 to 3,30\u200akg\/cm2), latissimus dorsi (from 1,66\u200akg\/cm2 to 2,21\u200akg\/cm2) and infraspinatus (from 1,63\u200akg\/cm2 to 2,93\u200akg\/cm2). Moreover, a significant improvement in the BS test was noted in the NW group compared with the control group (from -1,16\u00b15,7\u200acm to 2,18\u00b15,1\u200acm in the NW group vs from -2,52\u00b16,1 to -2,92\u00b16,2 in the control group).\nA 12-week Nordic Walking training routine improves shoulder mobility and reduces tenderness in the following muscles: trapezius pars descendens and middle trapezius, infraspinatus and latissimus dorsi, in female office workers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5683cf058f610004ae1","authors":["Piotr Kocur","Barbara Pospieszna","Daniel Choszczewski","Lukasz Michalowski","Marzena Wiernicka","Jacek Lewandowski"],"doi":"10.3233\/wor-172497","first_seen_on":"2017-06-05T06:31:29+00:00","issns":["10519815","18759270"],"journal":"Work","last_mentioned_on":1496735629,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28234265"],"pmid":"28234265","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["occupationalmedicine"],"title":"The effects of Nordic Walking training on selected upper-body muscle groups in female-office workers: A randomized trial","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-nordic-walking-training-selected-upperbody-muscle-groups-femaleoffice-workers-randomized-tri"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.55,"score_history":{"1y":3.55,"6m":3.55,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8324953,"mean":7.0165383958894,"rank":1966521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6348453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8324953,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241775,"mean":12.361827971577,"rank":74002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":167279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241775,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":415,"mean":3.7858937198068,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":415,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":2,"IT":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nuriafortun\/statuses\/871615254052167680","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20823031],"posted_on":"2017-06-05T06:30:45+00:00","author":{"name":"N\u00faria Fort\u00fan","url":"http:\/\/promocionsaludtrabajo.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/800405051130920960\/6GwMyzGR_normal.jpg","description":"Investigadora de la vida, Promoci\u00f3n de la salud en el trabajo y m\u00e1s  #PRL #PST #WHP #AgeingWell #TWH","id_on_source":"nuriafortun","tweeter_id":"1222907048","geo":{"lt":41.38879,"ln":2.15899,"country":"ES"},"followers":466},"tweet_id":"871615254052167680"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NordicWalkingL\/statuses\/871615576770269184","license":"gnip","rt":["nuriafortun"],"citation_ids":[20823031],"posted_on":"2017-06-05T06:32:01+00:00","author":{"name":"NW Lombardia","url":"http:\/\/www.nordicwalkinglombardia.it","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/586833959054614528\/yrek6sXW_normal.jpg","description":"Scuola di Nordic Walking Lago di Como, Lecco dell'ANI Associazione Nordic Fitness Italiana","id_on_source":"NordicWalkingL","tweeter_id":"3155653959","geo":{"lt":45.85317,"ln":9.39005,"country":"IT"},"followers":267},"tweet_id":"871615576770269184"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/quillicoifrigni\/statuses\/871673775846195200","license":"gnip","rt":["nuriafortun"],"citation_ids":[20823031],"posted_on":"2017-06-05T10:23:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Quilli co i frigni","url":"http:\/\/www.quillicoifrigni.it","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/823174761962500097\/H_cIOqzF_normal.jpg","description":"Amici \u00e8 praticanti del Nordic Walking.
