We examined the correlation of ADHD symptoms with life satisfaction and whether this association is mediated by (lacking) social support and depressive symptoms. Self-reported ADHD symptoms, life satisfaction, social support, and depressive symptoms were assessed in a representative, predominantly adult sample from the general population (14-91 years, N = 2517). Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder symptoms correlated negatively with life satisfaction (r = -0.41, p < 0.01), even after demographic factors (gender, age, income) and common risk factors (not being in a relationship, being unemployed) were controlled for (r = -0.39, p < 0.01). Social support mediated up to 23% and depressive symptoms up to 44% in the association between ADHD symptoms and life satisfaction. Counteracting problems with social relationships and treating depressive symptoms may help to increase life satisfaction in adults with ADHD symptoms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e6f","authors":["Hennig, Timo","Koglin, Ute","Schmidt, S\u00f6ren","Petermann, Franz","Br\u00e4hler, Elmar"],"doi":"10.1097\/nmd.0000000000000700","first_seen_on":"2017-08-30T22:39:45+00:00","issns":["0022-3018"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease","last_mentioned_on":1504132699,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jonmd\/Abstract\/2017\/09000\/Attention_Deficit_Hyperactivity_Disorder_Symptoms.9.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jonmd\/2017\/09000\/Attention_Deficit_Hyperactivity_Disorder_Symptoms.9.pdf","pmid":"28609313","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"720","subjects":["psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms and Life Satisfaction in a Representative Adolescent and Adult Sample","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jonmd\/Fulltext\/2017\/09000\/Attention_Deficit_Hyperactivity_Disorder_Symptoms.9.aspx","volume":"205","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/attentiondeficithyperactivity-disorder-symptoms-life-satisfaction-representative-adolescent-adult-sa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":6412490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1149028,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173989,"mean":12.525440478654,"rank":123163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31769,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173989,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2106,"mean":4.3313605700713,"rank":1764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2106,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":0.78958333333333,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ThihaSwe_dr\/statuses\/903024108992114688","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24544066],"posted_on":"2017-08-30T22:38:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Psychiatry Updates","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PsychiatryUpdates.by.DrThihaSwe","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3471096253\/6b7bd3fc313986902cd1574474364bae_normal.jpeg","description":"[RSS Updates from Psychiatry Journals globally, plus some mental health related news] \/ Should follow only if you are interested in Mental Health","id_on_source":"ThihaSwe_dr","tweeter_id":"1259166031","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":997},"tweet_id":"903024108992114688"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms and Life... : The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1606024872801224&id=450103581726698","license":"public","citation_ids":[24544066],"posted_on":"2017-08-30T22:38:13+00:00","summary":"The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease - Current Issue\nAttention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms and Life Satisfaction in a Representative Adolescent and Adult Sample Abstract: Although it is well documented that attention-deficit\/hyperactivity","author":{"name":"Psychiatry - Updates by Dr Thiha Swe","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/450103581726698","facebook_wall_name":"Psychiatry - Updates by Dr Thiha Swe","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/450103581726698\/picture","id_on_source":"450103581726698"}}]}}
