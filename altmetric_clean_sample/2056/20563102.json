The SCD children were taller, but had similar weight and BMI to the CC controls. The SCD group had lower weight and BMI than the AC controls. The AC controls were of greater height, weight, and BMI than CC controls. These data highlight the importance of using ethnically appropriate reference ranges.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002302","authors":["R Patey","K Sylvester","G Rafferty","M Dick","A Greenough"],"doi":"10.1136\/adc.87.4.352","first_seen_on":"2017-05-26T11:03:45+00:00","issns":["00039888","14682044"],"issue":"4","journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","last_mentioned_on":1340755200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1763031\/pdf\/v087p00352"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1763031\/pdf\/v087p00352.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1763031","pmid":"12244019","pubdate":"2002-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"352","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"The importance of using ethnically appropriate reference ranges for growth assessment in sickle cell disease","type":"article","volume":"87","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/importance-using-ethnically-appropriate-reference-ranges-growth-assessment-sickle-cell-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7792430,"mean":6.6312338178446,"rank":1906625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4820770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7792430,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99743,"mean":11.136801327425,"rank":29393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":69439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99743,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634,"mean":7.2132160748693,"rank":1277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":3.8885294117647,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Social Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Sickle cell disease: managing acute painful episodes in hospital: Appendix F: Full health economic report","url":"https:\/\/www.nice.org.uk\/guidance\/cg143\/evidence\/appendix-f-full-health-economic-report-186634334","license":"public","citation_ids":[239444,5095159,4967196,15752883,1421309,2418518,1428906,20563001,20563008,20563017,15783469,20563060,20563072,20563076,4876750,20563102,239444,5095159,20563124,15782421,234108,6038132,4967196,203567,20563102,20563191,20563204],"posted_on":"2012-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","source":{"name":"National Institute for Health and Care Excellence","description":"The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK provides national guidance and advice to improve health and social care.","geo":{"country":"GB"}},"page_url":"https:\/\/www.nice.org.uk\/guidance\/cg143\/evidence","collections":[],"author":{"image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/cache.altmetric.com\/policy\/thumbnails\/thumbnail-26717aa5d6b61dff0812935250eb4ae252bfe07822429d6c8a01cadce74ad4b2.jpg"}}]}}
