It is difficult to ascertain to what extent such reporting accurately represents the satisfaction levels of young people, with emerging research suggesting wide discrepancies. As part of a wider study evaluating the effectiveness of a Supported Discharge Service (SDS) operating within South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, this paper examines how young people experience inpatient services, on a social and emotional level. Twenty young people, (10 SDS and 10 TAU) participated in a semi-structured visual-interview study to examine their experiences of admission, ward-life and treatment. A thematic decomposition analysis was conducted on the data and specific themes relevant to satisfaction and engagement with inpatient services was examined in-depth. These include a) Behavioural surveillance as care surrogate and b) Managing the delicate emotional ecology of the ward: openness, triggering, sterility and relational engagements. Finally, we explore some of the implications of these inpatient experiences for supported discharge services.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029b7","authors":["Reavey, Paula","Poole, Jason","Corrigall, Richard","Zundel, Tony","Byford, Daniel","Sarhane, Sarah","Taylor, Mandy","Taylor, Eric","Ivens, John","Ougrin, Dennis"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.healthplace.2017.05.008","first_seen_on":"2017-05-26T11:32:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["13538292","1873-2054"],"journal":"Health & Place","last_mentioned_on":1496340120,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1353829216303756"],"pmid":"28554098","pubdate":"2017-05-30T22:00:23+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Geography","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","epidemiology"],"title":"The ward as emotional ecology: Adolescent experiences of managing mental health and distress in psychiatric inpatient settings","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ward-emotional-ecology-adolescent-experiences-managing-mental-health-distress-psychiatric-inpatient"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.08,"score_history":{"1y":8.08,"6m":8.08,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":1082439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":7214322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239867,"mean":12.180869277013,"rank":45147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":194525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239867,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":800,"mean":8.7086232790989,"rank":237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":800,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":8.9906666666667,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
