We applied POSSUM to a population of lung resection candidates to assess its capability to predict postoperative complications.\nTwo hundred fifty lung resection candidates were prospectively evaluated from 1993 through 1996. The POSSUM value was entered along with other variables (sex, smoking history, type of resection, pulmonary function tests, arterial carbon dioxide, serum albumin level, total lymphocyte count, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and diabetes) in a multivariate analysis to identify independent predictors of postoperative morbidity.\nLogistic regression analysis showed POSSUM was predictive of postoperative complications, showing no significant difference between predicted and observed morbidity (chi2 test, p > 0.05).\nWe think POSSUM can be appropriately used as a tool of surgical audit in lung resection operations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a35","authors":["Alessandro Brunelli","Aroldo Fianchini","Rosaria Gesuita","Flavia Carle"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0003-4975(98)00822-4","first_seen_on":"2017-05-26T11:12:01+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["00034975","0003-4975"],"issue":"2","journal":"The Annals of Thoracic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1326153600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0003-4975(98)00822-4"],"pmid":"10197649","pubdate":"1999-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"POSSUM scoring system as an instrument of audit in lung resection surgery","type":"article","volume":"67","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/possum-scoring-system-instrument-audit-lung-resection-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7792430,"mean":6.6312338178446,"rank":1907269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4820507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7792430,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99770,"mean":11.139300383887,"rank":29409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":69451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99770,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3243,"mean":3.5103960518199,"rank":444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":2329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3243,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":2.15,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
