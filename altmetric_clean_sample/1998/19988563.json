This can in principle be achieved by reducing coke formation, sintering and loss of metal through diffusion in the support. [{Ni(\u03bc2-OCHO)(OCHO)(tmeda)}2(\u03bc2-OH2)], readily synthesized and soluble in a broad range of solvents, was developed as a molecular precursor to form pure 2 nm Ni(0) nanoparticles on alumina, the commonly used support in DRM. While such small nanoparticles prevent coke deposition and increase the initial activity, operando XANES confirms that deactivation largely occurs through the migration of Ni into the support. However, we show that Ni loss into the support can be mitigated through the Mg-doping of alumina, thereby increasing significantly the stability for the dry reforming of methane via minimization of Ni-migration into the support. The superior performance of our catalytic system is a direct consequence of the molecular design of the metal precursor and the support yielding in a maximization of the amount of accessible metallic nickel in the form of small nanoparticles while preventing coke deposition.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Tigran Margossian","Kim Larmier","Sung Min Kim","Frank Krumeich","Alexey Fedorov","Peter Chen","Christoph Mueller","Christophe Cop\u00e9ret"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.7b01625","first_seen_on":"2017-05-10T01:47:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1494380823,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.7b01625"],"pmid":"28445048","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Molecularly-Tailored Nickel Precursor and Support Yield a Stable Methane Dry Reforming Catalyst with Superior Metal Utilization","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecularly-tailored-nickel-precursor-support-yield-stable-methane-dry-reforming-catalyst-superior-m"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183022,"mean":6.92160443679,"rank":7081515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183022,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237802,"mean":12.404439131879,"rank":193354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237802,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19030,"mean":5.2690790898103,"rank":16909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19030,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264,"mean":13.902357414449,"rank":239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
