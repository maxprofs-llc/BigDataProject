We report a new technique for pediatric tracheotomy that reduces the issue of granulation and recannulation after accidental decannulation.\nClinical data were retrospectively reviewed for 32 pediatric patients aged 3weeks-32months who underwent Quattro Flap Tracheotomy (QFT) at our hospital. The technique for the procedure is described and illustrated in detail. We analyzed the complications of surgery and the prognosis of patients.\nTwenty-seven out of 32 pediatric tracheotomy patients were aged <12months. Overall, one patient with subglottic stenosis developed granulation and required a resection. Three patients with granulation were cured using conservative treatment. Neither pneumothorax nor accidental decannulation and failure to reinsert the cannula occurred with QFT. No tracheotomy-related deaths occurred. The overall rate of postoperative complications was lower in the study group (4\/32 cases, 12.5%) than in the control group (12\/32 cases, 37.5%; p=0.041).\nQFT is a new method for pediatric tracheotomy that should be performed in younger infants. If performed appropriately, QFT may reduce the incidence of complications and death in many cases that involve persistent granulation.\nIV.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dd6","authors":["Jun-ya Kita","Seiji Hosokawa","Kastuyoshi Suzuki","Katsura Hakamada","Hiroyuki Mineta"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jpedsurg.2017.04.017","first_seen_on":"2017-05-10T01:47:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00223468","1531-5037"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatric Surgery (Science Direct)","last_mentioned_on":1498099219,"links":["http:\/\/www.jpedsurg.org\/article\/S0022-3468(17)30258-0\/fulltext?rss=yes","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28499712?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28499712"],"pmid":"28499712","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pediatrics"],"title":"Quattro Flap Tracheotomy-the impact of a novel surgical technique for young infants","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quattro-flap-tracheotomythe-impact-novel-surgical-technique-young-infants"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":4490880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2340978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248750,"mean":12.569180426856,"rank":137825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":87970,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248750,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2072,"mean":2.1446151617576,"rank":925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2072,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":1.5142307692308,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IllingworthInfo\/statuses\/862121717333983232","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19988562],"posted_on":"2017-05-10T01:46:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Illingworth Library","url":"http:\/\/www.sheffieldchildrens.nhs.uk\/our-services\/library","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/667365783845142528\/bfkqalCj_normal.png","description":"We are an NHS library at Sheffield Children\u2019s Hospital specialising in paediatrics and supporting evidence based practice, professional development and research","id_on_source":"IllingworthInfo","tweeter_id":"423358222","geo":{"lt":53.38297,"ln":-1.4659,"country":"GB"},"followers":306},"tweet_id":"862121717333983232"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/863708124347195397","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19988562],"posted_on":"2017-05-14T10:50:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":441},"tweet_id":"863708124347195397"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TFujiwarbi\/statuses\/877717860935647233","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19988562],"posted_on":"2017-06-22T02:40:19+00:00","author":{"name":"\u85e4\u539f\u5d07\u5fd7","url":"http:\/\/warabii.blogspot.jp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000698764772\/8c934b2539125c46f77f1557707d18ff_normal.png","description":"\u8033\u3068\u9f3b\u3068\u5589\u3068\u9996\u304c\u5c02\u9580\u306e\u533b\u8005\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3069\u3046\u3084\u3063\u305f\u3089\u75c5\u9662\u306e \u691c\u67fb\u3068\u3046\u307e\u304f\u3064\u304d\u3042\u3048\u308b\u304b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u672c\u3092\u66f8\u3044\u3066\u307e\u3059\u3002http:\/\/www.amazon.co.jp\/dp\/479931761X\/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_oNBxwb00F09WF","id_on_source":"TFujiwarbi","tweeter_id":"770734266","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":330},"tweet_id":"877717860935647233"}]}}
