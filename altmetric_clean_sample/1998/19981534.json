Because human studies have reported frequent genetic alterations in the Ras- and TGF\u03b2\/SMAD-signaling pathways in ECC, mice with tamoxifen-inducible, duct-cell-specific Kras activation and a TGF\u03b2 receptor type 2 (TGF\u03b2R2) deletion were first generated by crossing LSL-Kras(G12D) , Tgfbr2(flox\/flox) , and K19(CreERT) mice (KT-K19(CreERT) ). However, KT-K19(CreERT) mice showed only mild hyperplasia of biliary epithelial cells (BECs) in the extrahepatic bile duct (EHBD) and died within 7 wk, probably a result of lung adenocarcinomas. Next, to analyze the additional effect of E-cadherin loss, KT-K19(CreERT) mice were crossed with CDH1(flox\/flox) mice (KTC-K19(CreERT) ). Surprisingly, KTC-K19(CreERT) mice exhibited a markedly thickened EHBD wall accompanied by a swollen gallbladder within 4 wk after tamoxifen administration. Histologically, invasive periductal infiltrating-type ECC with lymphatic metastasis was observed. Time-course analysis of EHBD revealed that recombined BECs lining the bile duct lumen detached due to E-cadherin loss, whereas recombined cells could survive in the peribiliary glands (PBGs), which are considered a BEC stem-cell niche. Detached dying BECs released high levels of IL-33, as determined by microarray analysis using biliary organoids, and stimulated inflammation and a regenerative response by PBGs, leading eventually to ECC development. Cell lineage tracing suggested PBGs as the cellular origin of ECC. IL-33 cooperated with Kras and TGF\u03b2R2 mutations in the development of ECC, and anti-IL-33 treatment suppressed ECC development significantly. Thus, this mouse model provided insight into the carcinogenic mechanisms, cellular origin, and potential therapeutic targets of ECC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Hayato Nakagawa","Nobumi Suzuki","Yoshihiro Hirata","Yohko Hikiba","Yoku Hayakawa","Hiroto Kinoshita","Sozaburo Ihara","Koji Uchino","Yuji Nishikawa","Hideaki Ijichi","Motoyuki Otsuka","Junichi Arita","Yoshihiro Sakamoto","Kiyoshi Hasegawa","Norihiro Kokudo","Keisuke Tateishi","Kazuhiko Koike"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1619416114","first_seen_on":"2017-05-09T17:21:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0027-8424","1091-6490"],"issue":"19","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1494422977,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/114\/19\/E3806.short?rss=1","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/114\/19\/E3806.abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.1619416114"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/114\/19\/E3806.full.pdf","pmid":"28439013","pubdate":"2017-05-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"E3806","subjects":["science"],"title":"Biliary epithelial injury-induced regenerative response by IL-33 promotes cholangiocarcinogenesis from peribiliary glands","type":"article","volume":"114","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biliary-epithelial-injuryinduced-regenerative-response-il33-promotes-cholangiocarcinogenesis-peribil"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183187,"mean":6.9217013823156,"rank":4100843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3873614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183187,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237113,"mean":12.415028307298,"rank":120066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":106978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237113,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46250,"mean":23.950090423577,"rank":34734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":10662,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46250,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":989,"mean":55.755034412955,"rank":785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":989,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
