A core element in relationships is commitment. Commitment may be based on affect and emotions, perceived costs, and even obligation. This research proposes that three types of commitment-affective, continuance, and normative commitment-differentially impact consumer purchase loyalty, attitudinal loyalty, and advocacy for a health care provider. To examine the impact of commitment type on consumer relationships, exploratory data were garnered and surveys were administered. Findings are discussed and implications for health care marketing managers in developing successful relationships with consumers are delineated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f61000157b","authors":["Elyria Kemp","Sonja Martin Poole"],"doi":"10.1080\/07359683.2017.1309210","first_seen_on":"2017-05-09T16:52:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0735-9683","1545-0864"],"journal":"Health Marketing Quarterly","last_mentioned_on":1495127418,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07359683.2017.1309210?utm_content=buffer3cd63&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07359683.2017.1309210?utm_content=buffer9bff1&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"28453400","publisher":"Routledge","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Marketing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Business, Management and Accounting","Health Professions","Social Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"What\u2019s love got to do with it?
