Given the essentiality of tight junctions (TJ) in epithelial integrity, we hypothesized that MSC modulate TJ formation, via the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) pathway. Liver kinase-\u03b21 (LKB1) and Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) represent the main kinases that activate AMPK.\nThe in vitro Ca(2+) switch from 5\u2009\u03bcM to 1.8\u2009mM was performed using epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells cultured alone or cocultured with rat bone marrow-derived MSC or preexposed to MSC-conditioned medium. TJ assembly was measured by assessing ZO-1 relocation to cell-cell contacts. Experiments were conducted using MDCK stably expressing short-hairpin-RNA (shRNA) against LKB1 or luciferase (LUC, as controls). Compound STO-609 (50\u2009\u03bcM) was used as CaMKK inhibitor.\nFollowing Ca(2+) switch, ZO-1 relocation and phosphorylation\/activation of AMPK were significantly higher in MDCK\/MSC compared to MDCK. No difference in AMPK phosphorylation was observed between LKB1-shRNA and Luc-shRNA MDCK following Ca(2+) switch. Conversely, incubation with STO-609 prior to Ca(2+) switch prevented AMPK phosphorylation and ZO-1 relocation. MSC-conditioned medium slightly but significantly increased AMPK activation and accelerated TJ-associated distribution of ZO-1 post Ca(2+) switch in comparison to regular medium.\nMSC modulate the assembly of epithelial TJ, via the CaMKK\/AMPK pathway independently of LKB1.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5363cf058f61000460b","authors":["Rowart, Pascal","ERPICUM, Pauline","KRZESINSKI, Jean-Marie","Sebbagh, Micha\u00ebl","JOURET, Fran\u00e7ois"],"doi":"10.1155\/2017\/9717353","first_seen_on":"2017-09-18T13:17:36+00:00","handle":"2268\/214338","handles":["2268\/214338"],"issns":["1687-966X","1687-9678"],"journal":"Stem Cells International","last_mentioned_on":1505740602,"links":["http:\/\/orbi.ulg.ac.be\/handle\/2268\/214338"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/orbi.ulg.ac.be\/bitstream\/2268\/214338\/1\/9717353.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5525096","pmid":"28781597","pubdate":"2017-07-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Accelerate Epithelial Tight Junction Assembly via the AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Pathway, Independently of Liver Kinase B1","type":"article","volume":"2017","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mesenchymal-stromal-cells-accelerate-epithelial-tight-junction-assembly-via-ampactivated-protein-kin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":7284552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110704,"mean":11.824497150032,"rank":90276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110704,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":477,"mean":2.2583277310924,"rank":348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":477,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.675,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
