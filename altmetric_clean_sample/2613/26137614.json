Compared to the general population, PLWH have a 2-fold higher risk of cardiovascular disease, a 3-fold increased risk of fracture, and a risk of kidney disease that is comparable to that in diabetes. Some comorbidities may present at younger ages than among the general population, suggesting the possibility of accelerated aging with HIV infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f610005983","authors":["Puja Van Epps","Robert C.
