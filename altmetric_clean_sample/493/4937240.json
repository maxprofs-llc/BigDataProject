The liver remnant must be protected to avoid morbidity.\nWe prospectively enrolled all patients with the diagnosis of CRLM requiring right hepatectomy from 2009 to 2012. In all cases right hepatectomy with an anterior-hanging maneuver approach was attempted. We compared the group of patients who underwent this procedure with a group of patients who had previously undergone a conventional right hepatectomy. To minimize selection bias, propensity score matching was performed, based on baseline patient characteristics.\nA right hepatectomy was planned in 57 cases. The anterior-hanging approach was feasible in 85% of cases. Overall morbidity was similar. In-hospital mortality due to hepatic insufficiency was 2.3% in anterior-hanging group compared to 9% in the conventional group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.30). The incidence of ascites was significantly greater in the conventional group (AH: 18% vs Conv: 54%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and hospital stay was longer (AH: 10.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.7 vs Conv: 14.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.1 days; p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Bilirubin levels were significantly lower in anterior-hanging group in day 1 and 3. There were no differences on recurrence nor survival.\nThe anterior-hanging approach for right hepatectomy in patients with CRLM can be used safely with a high feasibility rate. Its use contributes to improve postoperative course.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007373","authors":["Llado, L","Mu\u00f1oz, A","Ramos, E","Torras, J","Fabregat, J","Rafecas, A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejso.2015.11.009","first_seen_on":"2015-12-30T11:42:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-2157"],"issue":"2","journal":"European Journal of Surgical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1463746365,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26710993?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26710993","pubdate":"2015-12-30T22:01:33+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","generalsurgery"],"title":"The anterior hanging-approach improves postoperative course after right hepatectomy in patients with colorectal liver metastases.
