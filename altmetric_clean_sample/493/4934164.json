The purposes of this study were: (1) to assess patterns of poly-tobacco use among a representative sample of high school students and (2) to determine how beliefs correlate with poly-tobacco use. Data came from the 2013 North Carolina Youth Tobacco Survey (n = 4092). SAS logistic regression survey procedures were used to account for the complex survey design and sampling weights. Among all high school students in NC in 2013, 29.7% reported current any tobacco use, with 19.1% reporting current poly-tobacco use, and 10.6% reporting current use of only one product. Among poly-tobacco users, 59.3% reported that one of the products they currently used was cigarettes. Positive tobacco product beliefs were found to be significantly associated with poly-tobacco use. Communication campaigns, policy efforts, and future research are needed for prevention, regulation, and control of poly-tobacco use among adolescents, which represents a significant public health problem.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f6100078a4","authors":["Sarah Kowitt"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijerph121114477","endpage":"14489","first_seen_on":"2015-12-29T15:55:33+00:00","funders":["nci"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1660-4601"],"issue":"11","journal":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1452027556,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3390\/ijerph121114477","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/12\/11\/14477\/htm"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/12\/11\/14477\/pdf","pmid":"26580636","pubdate":"2015-11-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"14477","subjects":["publichealth","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Poly-Tobacco Use among High School Students","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polytobacco-among-high-school-students-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6908690,"mean":6.2029462469629,"rank":904906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":5997630,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6908690,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299845,"mean":8.9995818759086,"rank":50761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":248680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299845,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2402,"mean":7.1654102457309,"rank":372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":2028,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2402,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194,"mean":7.3689740932642,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"19% of teens use more than one kind of tobacco - Futurity","url":"http:\/\/www.futurity.org\/teenagers-tobacco-1080362-2\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[4934164],"posted_on":"2015-12-29T15:55:21+00:00","summary":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill rightOriginal Study Posted by on December 29, 2015 You are free to share this article under the Attribution 4.0 International license.","author":{"name":"Futurity","url":"http:\/\/www.futurity.org\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/030\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2014-07-16_at_11.51.38.png?1405507934"}}],"facebook":[{"title":"Caterpillar Vapes","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1542719012533169&id=1059131910891884","license":"public","citation_ids":[4908130,4882903,5006247,4740676,4934164,4961805,4408707,4408706],"posted_on":"2016-01-05T20:59:16+00:00","summary":"CDC keeps lying about vaping to lobby for FDA e-cig deeming ban\n\nBreaking News: Three weeks after MTF finds far more 8th, 10th and 12th graders smoke cigarettes than use nicotine e-cigs (7.0% vs < 2.6%), CDC report and press release lie about impact of e-c","author":{"name":"Caterpillar Vapes","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1059131910891884","facebook_wall_name":"Caterpillar Vapes","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/1059131910891884\/picture","id_on_source":"1059131910891884"}}]}}
