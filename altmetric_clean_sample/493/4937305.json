While structural imaging using OCT is a mature technology in many respects, flow and motion estimation using OCT remains an intense area of research. In particular, there is keen interest in maximizing information extraction from the complex-valued OCT signal. Here, we introduce a Bayesian framework into the data workflow in OCT-based velocimetry. We demonstrate that using prior information in this Bayesian framework can significantly improve velocity estimate precision in a correlation-based, model-based framework for Doppler and transverse velocimetry. We show results in calibrated flow phantoms as well as in vivo in a Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) heart. Thus, our work improves upon the current approaches in terms of improved information extraction from the complex-valued OCT signal.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c7b","authors":["Zhou, Kevin C","Huang, Brendan K","Tagare, Hemant","Choma, Michael A"],"doi":"10.1364\/boe.6.004796","first_seen_on":"2015-12-30T11:50:25+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi","nigms"],"issns":["2156-7085"],"issue":"12","journal":"Biomedical Optics Express","last_mentioned_on":1451476208,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26713195?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4679255","pmid":"26713195","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Improved velocimetry in optical coherence tomography using Bayesian analysis.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improved-velocimetry-optical-coherence-tomography-using-bayesian-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6892495,"mean":6.1874169550219,"rank":5138600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":987684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6892495,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300538,"mean":8.9657068048192,"rank":205132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":56226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300538,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":498,"mean":8.7615452716298,"rank":255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":498,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":17.83125,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
