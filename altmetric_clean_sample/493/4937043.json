It has been found to be associated with nulliparity and subfertility, as well as with pelvic inflammatory disease. High parity has been reported to be protective but not in our 3 cases. History of pregnancy and the use of oral contraceptives decrease the PFTC risk significantly in literature. PFTC has been described in high-risk breast-ovarian cancer families with germ-line BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations. Symptoms are nonspecific and include abdominal pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding and watery discharge. However, diagnosis is rarely achieved pre-operative because of misleading imaging. In many cases, the diagnosis is made incidentally on histopathology after surgery for an un-related condition commonly being an ovarian carcinoma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cc95","authors":["Chaudhry, Shama","Hussain, Rubina","Zuberi, Madiha Munir","Zaidi, Zehra"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-30T11:18:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0030-9982"],"issue":"1","journal":"JPMA The Journal of the Pakistan Medical Association","last_mentioned_on":1451474309,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26712194?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26712194","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Rare primary fallopian tube carcinoma; a gynaecologist's dilemma.","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rare-primary-fallopian-tube-carcinoma-gynaecologists-dilemma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6892495,"mean":6.1874169550219,"rank":5904798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6892495,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300538,"mean":8.9656880051373,"rank":244300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300538,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":322,"mean":1.8020436137072,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":322,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.1296363636364,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/682158811574976512","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4937043],"posted_on":"2015-12-30T11:18:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":714},"tweet_id":"682158811574976512"}]}}
