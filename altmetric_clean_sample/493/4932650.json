Although the cause of RA remains unknown, the complex interaction between immune mediators (cytokines and effector cells) is responsible for the joint damage that begins at the synovial membrane. Activated macrophages are critical in the pathogenesis of RA and have been shown to specifically express a receptor for the vitamin folic acid (FA), folate receptor \u03b2 (FR\u03b2). This particular receptor allows internalization of FA-coupled cargo. In this review we will address the potential of nanoparticles as an effective drug delivery system for therapies that will directly target activated macrophages. Special attention will be given to stealth degree of the nanoparticles as a strategy to avoid clearance by macrophages of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). This review summarizes the application of FA-target nanoparticles as drug delivery systems for RA and proposes prospective future directions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000823b","authors":["Nogueira, Eug\u00e9nia","Gomes, Andreia C","Preto, Ana","Cavaco-Paulo, Artur"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nano.2015.12.365","first_seen_on":"2015-12-29T10:38:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1549-9634","1549-9642"],"journal":"Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology and Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1451385484,"links":["http:\/\/www.nanomedjournal.com\/article\/S1549-9634(15)00610-3\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nanomedjournal.com\/article\/S1549963415006103\/pdf","pmid":"26733257","pubdate":"2016-01-07T22:01:34+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology","biotechnology"],"title":"Folate-targeted nanoparticles for rheumatoid arthritis therapy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/folatetargeted-nanoparticles-rheumatoid-arthritis-therapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6889784,"mean":6.1841211059894,"rank":5902088,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6889784,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299299,"mean":8.9853296781133,"rank":243197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299299,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":677,"mean":5.1614674556213,"rank":479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":677,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":5.0067123287671,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
