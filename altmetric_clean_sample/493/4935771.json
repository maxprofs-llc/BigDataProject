To compare long-term clinical outcomes of the two stenting strategies, we extended the follow-up of our study on bifurcation stenting.\nOne hundred and one patients with coronary bifurcation lesions had been randomly assigned to provisional T-stenting and 101 to routine T-stenting, using sirolimus-eluting stents. We performed complete five-year follow-up. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of target lesion revascularisation (TLR), and the primary safety endpoint was the incidence of definite\/probable stent thrombosis (ST). We also monitored death, myocardial infarction (MI) and MACE (composite of death, MI and TLR). The cumulative five-year incidence of TLR in the provisional T-stenting arm was not significantly different from that in the routine T-stenting arm (16.2% vs. 16.3%, p=0.97). The same was true for MACE (22.8% vs. 22.9%, p=0.91), the composite of death and MI (9.9% vs. 13.9%, p=0.40), and ST (2.0% vs. 5.1%; p=0.25).\nDuring five-year follow-up, routine T-stenting offered no advantage over provisional T-stenting with respect to TLR or MACE.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccce","authors":["Ferenc, Miroslaw","Ayoub, Mohamed","B\u00fcttner, Hans-Joachim","Gick, Michael","Comberg, Thomas","Rothe, J\u00fcrgen","Valina, Christian M","Hochholzer, Willibald","Neumann, Franz-Josef"],"doi":"10.4244\/eijv11i8a175","first_seen_on":"2015-12-30T02:56:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1969-6213"],"issue":"8","journal":"EuroIntervention","last_mentioned_on":1451315761,"links":["http:\/\/www.pcronline.com\/eurointervention\/91st_issue\/volume-11\/number-8\/175\/long-term-outcomes-of-routine-versus-provisional-t-stenting-for-de-novo-coronary-bifurcation-lesions-five-year-results-of-the-bifurcations-bad-krozingen-i-study.html"],"pmid":"26696453","pubdate":"2015-12-30T22:07:10+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Long-term outcomes of routine versus provisional T-stenting for de novo coronary bifurcation lesions: five-year results of the Bifurcations Bad Krozingen I study.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-outcomes-routine-versus-provisional-tstenting-novo-coronary-bifurcation-lesions-fiveyear-re"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8113377,"mean":6.8875248791553,"rank":7026821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8113377,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":315998,"mean":9.2920498928783,"rank":263516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":315998,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":738,"mean":3.9955169606513,"rank":589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":738,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":6.4423076923077,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
