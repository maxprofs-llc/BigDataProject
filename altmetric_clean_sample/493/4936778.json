Ampicillin-resistant isolates producing beta-lactamase as demonstrated by a nitrocefin assay were analyzed for the presence of TEM-1 and ROB-1 genes by PCR. Eleven percent of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin (10 \u00b5g\/ml), of which 73% were beta-lactamase positive and carried TEM-1 gene, but none were positive for ROB-1 gene. All isolates susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate (20\/10 \u00b5g\/ml), azithromycin (15 \u00b5g\/ml), aztreonam (30 \u00b5g\/ml), cefotaxime (30 \u00b5g\/ml), ceftriaxone (30 \u00b5g\/ml), ciprofloxacin (5 \u00b5g\/ml), levofloxacin (5 \u00b5g\/ml), and telithromycin (15 \u00b5g\/ml) but 24%, 15%, 4%, 4%, 2%, 1%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.5% and 0.5% were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (1.25\/23.75 \u00b5g\/ml), tetracycline (30 \u00b5g\/ml), cefaclor (30 \u00b5g\/ml), clarithromycin (15 \u00b5g\/ml), cefuroxime (30 \u00b5g\/ml), meropenem (10 \u00b5g\/ml), chloramphenicol (30 \u00b5g\/ml), ampicillin-sulbactam (10\/10 \u00b5g\/ml), nalidixic acid (30 \u00b5g\/ml), and fosfomycin (30 \u00b5g\/ml), respectively. MIC values of three cefuroxime-resistant isolates was 24, 48 and > 256 \u00b5g\/ml, respectively; of two meropenem-resistant strains > 256 \u00b5g\/ml; and of two chloramphenicol-susceptible isolates (by disc diffusion method) 6 \u00b5g\/ml (considered as intermediate susceptible). Multiple- antibiotics resistance was detected in 15% of the strains, with resistance to 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 antibiotics in 8.5%, 4%, 2%, 0.5% and 0.5% of the isolates, respectively. By identifying beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, empirical therapy with beta-lactam\/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and second generation cephalosporins would be inappropriate for such patients (approximately 3%). Our findings will contribute to the epidemiological and clinical data regarding H. influenzae infection in Turkey.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa86b3cf058f61000c62e","authors":["Kuvat, Nuray","Nazik, Hasan","Berkiten, Rahmiye","\u00d6ngen, Betig\u00fcl"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-30T11:05:07+00:00","issns":["0125-1562"],"issue":"2","journal":"Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1451473475,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26513928?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26513928","pubdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"TEM-1 AND ROB-1 PRESENCE AND ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE IN HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE STRAINS, ISTANBUL, TURKEY.","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tem1-rob1-presence-antimicrobial-resistance-haemophilus-influenzae-strains-istanbul-turkey"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6892495,"mean":6.1874169550219,"rank":5904785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6892495,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300539,"mean":8.9656460281227,"rank":244286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300539,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265,"mean":1.9409924242424,"rank":179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.75,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AntibioticResis\/statuses\/682155314678923264","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4936778],"posted_on":"2015-12-30T11:04:35+00:00","author":{"name":"AntibioticResistance","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/551766191962746880\/GlO2QteM_normal.jpeg","description":"Keep abreast of the latest developments in the fight against Antibiotic Resistance #AMR with the latest publications curated from PubMed.
