Depending on the relative sign of the electron and hole transfer integrals, such delocalization can dramatically suppress recombination through destructive quantum interference. This could explain why measured recombination rates are significantly lower than predictions based on Langevin theory for a variety of organic bulk heterojunctions. Moreover, it opens up a design strategy for photovoltaic devices with enhanced efficiencies through coherently suppressed charge recombination.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dea","authors":["Roel Tempelaar","Tempelaar, Roel","Koster, L Jan Anton","Havenith, Remco W A","Knoester, Jasper","Jansen, Thomas L C","L.
