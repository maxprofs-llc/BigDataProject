Kellgren-Lawrence severity scores and mechanical axis angle (MAA) were determined from radiographs. Knee flexion and adduction angles and external moments were calculated from gait analysis using a 3-dimensional optical motion capture system and force plate. Peak values were identified and principal component analysis determined waveform characteristics (PC-scores). Linear regression models examined if OA group (post-traumatic or non-traumatic) predicted peak values and PC-scores after controlling for age, gait speed, and severity. Models were repeated with and without controlling for MAA.\nKnee OA group was a significant predictor of peak knee adduction angles (p=0.04) and moments (p=0.05). Similarly, it was a significant predictor for some knee adduction angle (p=0.02 to 0.64) and moment (p=0.02 to 0.25) PC-scores. The non-traumatic OA group had higher adduction angles and moments. There were no significant relationships between OA group and knee flexion angles and moments. After controlling for MAA, only one significant relationship remained between a knee adduction moment shape characteristics and OA group.\nFrontal plane knee kinematics and kinetics during walking differ between patients with post-traumatic versus non-traumatic medial compartment knee OA, with post-traumatic OA showing relatively decreased adduction.
