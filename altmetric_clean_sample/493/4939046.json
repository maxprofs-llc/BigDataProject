Their evolution during the last century made use of the best technologies available to continuously increase their efficacy and safety. Mass spectrometry (MS) and proteomics are already playing a central role in the identification and characterization of novel antigens. Over the last years, we have been witnessing the emergence of structural proteomics in vaccinology, as a major tool for vaccine candidate discovery, antigen design and life cycle management of existing products. In this review, we describe the MS techniques associated to structural proteomics and we illustrate the contribution of structural proteomics to vaccinology discussing potential applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d9","authors":["Danilo Donnarumma"],"doi":"10.1586\/14789450.2016.1121113","first_seen_on":"2015-12-31T00:03:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-8387"],"issue":"1","journal":"Expert Review of Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1451563349,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1586\/14789450.2016.1121113?ai=1lx1s&mi=ianpxd&af=R","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26714563?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26714563","pubdate":"2015-12-31T12:02:46+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The role of structural proteomics in vaccine development: recent advances and future prospects.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-structural-proteomics-vaccine-development-recent-advances-future-prospects-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6896042,"mean":6.1898417149761,"rank":4894798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1754701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6896042,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300796,"mean":8.9633993118235,"rank":187582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":95443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300796,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288,"mean":1.5380487804878,"rank":144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.1333333333333,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
