The liver failure syndrome progressed even though he received specific antiviral agent, broad-spectrum antibiotics and intensive supportive care. The patient received urgent liver transplantation 2 weeks later. Histological examination of the explant liver showed submassive necrosis and prominent ductular reaction.
