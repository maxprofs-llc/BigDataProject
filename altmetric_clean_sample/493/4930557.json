We therefore performed a meta-analysis of published studies to determine whether renal cancer risk in liver transplant recipients (LTRs) was increased. To obtain a more precise conclusion, a systematic search was performed in PubMed and Web of Science databases until June 10, 2015. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to estimate risk of renal cancer in LTRs. Heterogeneity test, sensitivity analysis, and publishing bias were also performed. We identified 8 eligible studies and performed a meta-analysis on data of 49,654 LTRs with a total follow-up of 121,514.6 patient-years. The SIR for renal cancer was identified a 3.275-fold higher SIR (95% CI: 1.857-5.777; P<0.001) in LTRs compared with the general population. This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that the LTRs was associated with a significant increase in the incidence of renal cancer. Such association suggests that yearly routine post-transplant surveillance is need for renal cancer in LTRs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079f1","authors":["Xun, Zhu","Jing-Zhe, Wang","Yi, Zhang","Min, Xu","Pen, Chen","Cun-Zu, Wang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijsu.2015.11.050","first_seen_on":"2015-12-28T20:12:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1743-9159","17439191"],"journal":"International Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1451334869,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1743919115013680&_version=1&md5=b44fb94b9b20574c96a282d474166bde"],"pmid":"26703380","pubdate":"2015-12-28T22:01:19+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Risk of renal cancer in liver transplant recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis ","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-renal-cancer-liver-transplant-recipients-systematic-review-metaanalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7205266,"mean":6.3457590500801,"rank":3179689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3996702,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7205266,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302809,"mean":9.1047428205329,"rank":127773,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":173009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302809,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":816,"mean":2.1324932515337,"rank":206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":816,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":1.878431372549,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IJSurgery\/statuses\/681566803525369856","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4930557],"posted_on":"2015-12-28T20:06:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Int J of Surgery","url":"http:\/\/www.journal-surgery.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/681553364858060802\/dGBKyXFu_normal.png","description":"An international, pan-specialty, peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the advancement of surgical research, education and clinical practice.
