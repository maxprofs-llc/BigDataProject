Physical examination revealed a small-sized female for age and breed with a normal vulva, vaginal length, and external cervical os. Further assessment by per rectum palpation and trans-rectal ultrasonography revealed a small uterine cervix and cord-like uterine horns with no identifiable ovaries. Additional evaluation including laparoscopy, hormonal evaluation, and genetic analysis allowed ruling out conditions commonly associated with a phenotypic female with infantile or underdeveloped reproductive organs such as freemartin, XY gonadal dysgenesis, testicular feminization, and bilateral ovarian agenesis. Laparoscopy confirmed the presence of a small cervix with small uterine horns and absence of ovaries. Testosterone, progesterone, and 17-\u03b2 estradiol concentrations were 200.0pg\/mL, 1.48ng\/mL, and undetectable, respectively. Genetic evaluation determined that the karyotype was 59,X non-mosaic. Evaluation of phenotypically female cattle with infertility and infantile genital organs and absence of ovaries should include cytogenetic analysis to test for possible X monosomy. The 59,X condition should be considered in the differential diagnoses together with freemartin, dysgenesis XY, testicular feminization, and bilateral ovarian agenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000225e","authors":["Romano, Juan E","Raussdepp, Terje","Mulon, Pierre Y","Villad\u00f3niga, Graciela B"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.anireprosci.2015.03.004","first_seen_on":"2015-12-30T13:03:45+00:00","issns":["1873-2232"],"journal":"Animal Reproduction Science","last_mentioned_on":1451480609,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25835572?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25835572","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Non-mosaic monosomy 59,X in cattle: A case report.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonmosaic-monosomy-59x-cattle-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6892495,"mean":6.1874169550219,"rank":5138591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":987657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6892495,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300539,"mean":8.9656654932153,"rank":205125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":56224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300539,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":353,"mean":1.5063068181818,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":353,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":0.7125,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
