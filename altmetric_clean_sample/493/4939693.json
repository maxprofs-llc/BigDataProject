Educational background, occupation, body mass index, symptom duration, etiology, dominant hemisphere, affected hemisphere, comorbid diseases, and Brunnstrom recovery stages (9), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score, and Functional Independence Measure score were assessed.\nIn multivariate linear regression analysis, we found that BDI score (P\u2009=\u2009.030) and comorbid diseases (P\u2009=\u2009.040) had the highest effect on change in PSQI.\nDepression and comorbid diseases were the most effective factors on poststroke sleep disorder in patients who underwent neurological rehabilitation and they should be managed to increase the efficacy of the neurological rehabilitation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ab3","authors":["Karaca, Burcu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2015.11.015","first_seen_on":"2015-12-31T02:09:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1052-3057","1532-8511"],"journal":"Journal of Stroke & Cerebrovascular Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1452499295,"links":["http:\/\/www.strokejournal.org\/article\/S1052-3057(15)00626-6\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26746576?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.strokejournal.org\/article\/S1052305715006266\/pdf","pmid":"26746576","pubdate":"2016-01-10T22:00:57+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Factors Affecting Poststroke Sleep Disorders.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factors-affecting-poststroke-sleep-disorders"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6938388,"mean":6.2242844220111,"rank":2807499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4049688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6938388,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301760,"mean":8.9843914978508,"rank":116392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":180736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301760,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":727,"mean":2.1196418732782,"rank":179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":727,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":1.5328767123288,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
