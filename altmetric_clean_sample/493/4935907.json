Here, we report a new marine phototrophic species, Paulinella longichromatophora sp. nov., using light and electron microscopy and molecular data. This new species contains two blue-green U-shaped chromatophores reaching up to 40\u03bcm in total length. Further, the new Paulinella species is characterized by having five oral scales surrounding the pseudostomal aperture. All trees generated using three nuclear rDNA datasets (18S rDNA, 28S rDNA, and the concatenated 18S + 28S rDNA) demonstrated that three photosynthetic Paulinella species (two freshwater species, P. chromatophora and Paulinella strain FK01, and one marine species, P. longichromatophora) congruently formed a monophyletic group with strong support (\u226590% of ML and \u22650.90 of PP), but their relationship to each other within the clade remained unresolved in all trees. P. longichromatophora, nevertheless, clustered consistently together with Paulinella strain FK01 with very low support, but the clade received strong support in plastid phylogenies. Phylogenetic analyses inferred from plastid-encoded 16S rDNA and a concatenated dataset of plastid 16S+23S rDNA demonstrated that chromatophores of all photosynthetic Paulinella species were monophyletic. The monophyletic group fell within a cyanobacteria clade having a close relationship to an \u03b1-cyanobacterial clade containing Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus species with very robust support (100% of ML and 1.0 of PP). Additionally, phylogenetic analyses of nuclear 18S rDNA and plastid 16S rDNA suggested divergent evolution within the photosynthetic Paulinella population after a single acquisition of the chromatophore. After the single acquisition of the chromatophore, ancestral photosynthetic Paulinella appears to have diverged into at least two distinct clades, one containing the marine P. longichromatophora and freshwater Paulinella strain FK01, the other P. chromatophora CCAC 0185.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f61000864b","authors":["Kim, Sunju","Park, Myung Gil"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.protis.2015.11.003","first_seen_on":"2015-12-30T03:52:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1618-0941","14344610"],"issue":"1","journal":"Protist","last_mentioned_on":1456792433,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26709891?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1434461015001157","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1434461015001157?sf20156825=1","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1434461015001157?sf20156826=1"],"pmid":"26709891","pubdate":"2015-12-30T22:02:04+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Paulinella longichromatophora sp. nov., a New Marine Photosynthetic Testate Amoeba Containing a Chromatophore ","type":"article","volume":"167","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/paulinella-longichromatophora-sp-nov-new-marine-photosynthetic-testate-amoeba-containing-chromatopho"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7325869,"mean":6.3768565404091,"rank":1381386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5936230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7325869,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305688,"mean":9.1144901287916,"rank":68858,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":236399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305688,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":308,"mean":3.1615570032573,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":308,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":6.4071428571429,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
