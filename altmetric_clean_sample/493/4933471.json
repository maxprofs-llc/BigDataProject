The novel silicon nanowire (SiNW) biosensors have advantages in molecular detection because of their high sensitivity and fast response. In this study, poly-crystalline silicon nanowire field-effect transistor (poly-SiNW FET) device was developed to achieve specific and ultrasensitive detection of miRNAs without labeling and amplification.\nThe poly-SiNW FET was fabricated by a top-down Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) wafer fabrication based technique. Single strand DNA (ssDNA) probe was bind to the surface of the poly-SiNW device which was silanated and aldehyde-modified. By comparing the difference of resistance value before and after ssDNA and miRNA hybridization, poly-SiNW device can be used to detect standard and real miRNA samples.\nPoly-SiNW device with different structures (different line width and different pitch) was applied to detect standard Let-7b sample with a detection limitation of 1 fM. One-base mismatched sequence could be distinguished meanwhile. Furthermore, these poly-SiNW arrays can detect snRNA U6 in total RNA samples extracted from HepG2 cells with a detection limitation of 0.2 \u03bcg\/mL. In general, structures with pitch showed better results than those without pitch in detection of both Let-7b and snRNA U6. Moreover, structures with smaller pitch showed better detection efficacy.\nOur findings suggest that poly-SiNW arrays could detect standard and real miRNA sample without labeling or amplification. Poly-SiNW biosensor device is promising for miRNA detection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["He, Jing","Zhu, Jianjun","Gong, Changguo","Qi, Jiming","Xiao, Han","Jiang, Bin","Zhao, Yulan"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0145160","first_seen_on":"2015-12-29T12:43:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1452029074,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26709827?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4692481","pmid":"26709827","pubdate":"2015-12-29T22:00:18+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Label-Free Direct Detection of miRNAs with Poly-Silicon Nanowire Biosensors.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/labelfree-direct-detection-mirnas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6908690,"mean":6.2029462469629,"rank":3388886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2014809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6908690,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299844,"mean":8.9996148917932,"rank":154037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":113035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299844,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102136,"mean":9.9638102903022,"rank":58951,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":32306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102136,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4911,"mean":11.197474949084,"rank":2979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4911,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/681817705393995776","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4933471],"posted_on":"2015-12-29T12:43:03+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
