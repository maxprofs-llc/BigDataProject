Over the last 20 years, the use of this technique has grown rapidly, and it has become a core requirement in many emergency medicine residencies and in some pediatric emergency medicine fellowships. The use of emergency ultrasound in the pediatric setting is increasing due to the lack of ionizing radiation with these studies, as compared to computed tomography. Utilizing diagnostic ultrasound in the emergency department can allow clinicians to arrive at a diagnosis at the bedside rather than sending the patient out of the department for another study. This issue focuses on common indications for diagnostic ultrasound, as found in the pediatric literature or extrapolated from adult literature where pediatric evidence is scarce. Limitations, current trends, controversies, and future directions of diagnostic ultrasound in the emergency department are also discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008485","authors":["Guttman, Joshua","Nelson, Bret P"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-28T17:24:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1549-9650"],"issue":"12","journal":"Pediatric Emergency Medicine Practice","last_mentioned_on":1452726019,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26682501?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26682501?utm_content=bufferf7ac8&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"26682501","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Diagnostic Emergency Ultrasound: Assessment Techniques In The Pediatric Patient.","type":"article","volume":"12"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6956879,"mean":6.2324552312088,"rank":2431765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4495509,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6956879,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300051,"mean":9.0105944342607,"rank":91513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":206542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300051,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.3681818181818,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"TR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PEMUpdates\/statuses\/681526031161753600","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4930167],"posted_on":"2015-12-28T17:24:02+00:00","author":{"name":"PEM Updates","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3077019133\/002e2b27f97368b10a18a0e458ba4336_normal.jpeg","description":".","id_on_source":"PEMUpdates","tweeter_id":"903773208","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":427},"tweet_id":"681526031161753600"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Levy_Library\/statuses\/684031493409214464","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4930167],"posted_on":"2016-01-04T15:19:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Levy Library","url":"http:\/\/library.mssm.edu","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/687684781027495936\/jp1zpR3T_normal.jpg","description":"Everything you need to know about the latest in Medical & Health Innovations, Education and Research @IcahnMountSinai #STEM #MedEd #science","id_on_source":"Levy_Library","tweeter_id":"80400500","geo":{"lt":43.00035,"ln":-75.4999,"country":"US"},"followers":2037},"tweet_id":"684031493409214464"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IcahnMountSinai\/statuses\/684035388336386048","license":"gnip","rt":["Levy_Library"],"citation_ids":[4930167],"posted_on":"2016-01-04T15:35:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Icahn School of Med","url":"http:\/\/icahn.mssm.edu","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/889568143110135808\/DhHpnbcX_normal.jpg","description":"Learn about our new campaign at http:\/\/www.icahn.mssm.edu\u00a0#ForYouForLife","id_on_source":"IcahnMountSinai","tweeter_id":"1268038951","geo":{"lt":43.00035,"ln":-75.4999,"country":"US"},"followers":5625},"tweet_id":"684035388336386048"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MindichCHDI\/statuses\/684472442451038208","license":"gnip","rt":["Levy_Library"],"citation_ids":[4930167],"posted_on":"2016-01-05T20:32:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Mindich CHDI","url":"http:\/\/icahn.mssm.edu\/research\/institutes\/child-health-and-development-institute","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/517342278768021504\/eASxZpev_normal.png","description":"The Mindich Child Health and Development Institute","id_on_source":"MindichCHDI","tweeter_id":"2836885567","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":151},"tweet_id":"684472442451038208"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DRMEHMETTATLI\/statuses\/687408863675576324","license":"gnip","rt":["Levy_Library"],"citation_ids":[4930167],"posted_on":"2016-01-13T23:00:19+00:00","author":{"name":"MEHMET TATLI","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/586238181458239488\/RTEMq0vG_normal.jpg","description":"Emergency Specialist in Turkey.
