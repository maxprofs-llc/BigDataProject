However, little is known about functional characteristics of the conversion from MCI to AD. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 25 AD patients, 31 MCI patients, and 42 well-matched normal controls at baseline. Twenty-one of the 31 MCI patients converted to AD at approximately 24 months of follow-up. Functional connectivity strength (FCS) and seed-based functional connectivity analyses were used to assess the functional differences among the groups. Compared to controls, subjects with MCI and AD showed decreased FCS in the default-mode network and the occipital cortex. Importantly, the FCS of the left angular gyrus and middle occipital gyrus was significantly lower in MCI-converters as compared with MCI-nonconverters. Significantly decreased functional connectivity was found in MCI-converters compared to nonconverters between the left angular gyrus and bilateral inferior parietal lobules, dorsolateral prefrontal and lateral temporal cortices, and the left middle occipital gyrus and right middle occipital gyri. We demonstrated gradual but progressive functional changes during a median 2-year interval in patients converting from MCI to AD, which might serve as early indicators for the dysfunction and progression in the early stage of AD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000427b","authors":["Li, Yuxia","Wang, Xiaoni","Li, Yongqiu","Sun, Yu","Sheng, Can","Li, Hongyan","Li, Xuanyu","Yu, Yang","Chen, Guanqun","Hu, Xiaochen","Jing, Bin","Wang, Defeng","Li, Kuncheng","Jessen, Frank","Xia, Mingrui","Han, Ying"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/4680972","first_seen_on":"2015-12-30T15:52:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2090-5904","1687-5443"],"journal":"Neural Plasticity","last_mentioned_on":1455319163,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/np\/2016\/4680972\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26843991?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26843991"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/np\/2016\/4680972.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4710946","pmid":"26843991","pubdate":"2015-12-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Abnormal Resting-State Functional Connectivity Strength in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Its Conversion to Alzheimer&#x2019;s Disease","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/abnormal-restingstate-functional-connectivity-strength-mild-cognitive-impairment-conversion-alzheime-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7185566,"mean":6.3172903489115,"rank":708061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":6472495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7185566,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":304439,"mean":9.0721221792283,"rank":40430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":263502,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":304439,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":641,"mean":2.802453125,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":641,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140,"mean":3.0257841726619,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
