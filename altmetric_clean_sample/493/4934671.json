Variants were investigated for segregation in the family by Sanger sequencing. A splice site mutation was further evaluated on the messenger RNA level by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Subsequently, a larger cohort was specifically screened for receptor expression-enhancing protein 1 (REEP1) gene mutations.\nWe detected a homozygous splice donor mutation in REEP1 (c.303+1-7GTAATAT>AC, p.F62Kfs23*; NM_022912) that cosegregated with the phenotype in the family, leading to complete skipping of exon 4 and a premature stop codon. The phenotype of the patient is similar to spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) with additional distal arthrogryposis and involvement of the upper motor neuron manifested by pronounced hyperreflexia.\nTo date, only dominant REEP1 mutations have been reported to be associated with a slowly progressive hereditary spastic paraplegia. The findings from our patient expand the phenotypical spectrum and the mode of inheritance of REEP1-associated disorders. Recessive mutations in REEP1 should be considered in the molecular genetic workup of patients with a neuromuscular disorder resembling SMARD1, especially if additional signs of upper motor neuron involvement and distal arthrogryposis are present.","altmetric_jid":"55c0b7b12a83eeef128b4567","authors":["Gudrun Schottmann","Dominik Seelow","Franziska Seifert","Susanne Morales-Gonzalez","Esther Gill","Katja von Au","Arpad von Moers","Werner Stenzel","Markus Schuelke"],"doi":"10.1212\/nxg.0000000000000032","first_seen_on":"2015-12-29T19:25:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2376-7839"],"issue":"4","journal":"Neurology: Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1451473020,"links":["http:\/\/ng.neurology.org\/content\/1\/4\/e32.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ng.neurology.org\/content\/1\/4\/e32.full.pdf","pmid":"27066569","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Recessive REEP1 mutation is associated with congenital axonal neuropathy and diaphragmatic palsy","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recessive-reep1-mutation-associated-congenital-axonal-neuropathy-diaphragmatic-palsy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6892495,"mean":6.1874169550219,"rank":1448881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5430082,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6892495,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299396,"mean":8.9867254229361,"rank":76183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":222289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299396,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":8.9832,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":6.84375,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
