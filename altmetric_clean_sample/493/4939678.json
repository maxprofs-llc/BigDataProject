This mitochondrial genome harbors 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNA), two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNA), and one control region (D-loop). The overall base composition is A (40.44%), C (17.12%), G (9.84%), and T (32.60%), so the slight A-T bias (73.04%) was detected. Phylogenetic analysis showed that T. oceanicus is closely related to T. emma that is also a member of the genus Teleogryllus.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f610004220","authors":["Zhou, Jiu-Xuan","Jia, Yong-Chao","Yang, Xue-Chao","Li, Qiang"],"doi":"10.3109\/19401736.2015.1115854","first_seen_on":"2015-12-31T02:01:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-1744"],"journal":"Mitochondrial DNA: The Journal of DNA Mapping, Sequencing & Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1451527269,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26712106?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26712106","pubdate":"2015-12-31T22:01:51+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"The complete mitochondrial genome of the black field cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus.","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6896042,"mean":6.1898417149761,"rank":5141315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":987820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6896042,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300796,"mean":8.9633398028556,"rank":205332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":56283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300796,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1483,"mean":0.73158434547908,"rank":433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":862,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1483,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132,"mean":1.0347328244275,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/phy_papers\/statuses\/682380941298253824","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4939678],"posted_on":"2015-12-31T02:01:09+00:00","author":{"name":"phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/438115152294989824\/0M7ZG0xC_normal.jpeg","description":"Continuous feed for phylogenetics papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
