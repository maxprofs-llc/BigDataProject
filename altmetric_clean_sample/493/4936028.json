Although various solid grafts have been used in the past for this purpose, diced cartilage grafts in fascia have become popular in recent decades. In this study, the authors analyze and discuss the results of using diced cartilage grafts wrapped in rectus abdominis muscle fascia for dorsal augmentation.\nNasal dorsum augmentation using the diced cartilage wrapped in rectus abdominis fascia technique was performed on 109 patients between 2008 and 2014. Six patients were primary cases, 69 patients were secondary, and 18 were tertiary. Sixteen patients had previously undergone more than three operations. In all patients, the rectus abdominis fascia was harvested with the described technique and wrapped around the diced cartilages obtained from the costal cartilage.\nThe average period of follow-up was 19.6 months (range: 6-47 months). Satisfactory results were obtained with acceptable complications and revision rates. Three patients were reoperated on due to overcorrection. Insufficient augmentation was seen in five patients. In four patients, infection developed after the 5 postoperative day. One patient complained of a hypertrophic scar on donor area. None of the patients showed any symptoms indicating an abdominal hernia.\nTechniques using diced cartilage grafts in fascia have now become the gold standard for dorsal augmentations. When it is considered that secondary cases requiring dorsal augmentation are usually those also needing costal cartilage grafts, rectus abdominis fascia becomes a useful carrier for diced cartilages, which is on the same donor area.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f61000854c","authors":["Cerkes, Nazim","Basaran, Karaca"],"doi":"10.1097\/prs.0000000000001876","first_seen_on":"2015-12-30T04:49:23+00:00","issns":["1529-4242","0032-1052"],"issue":"1","journal":"Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1453188607,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/plasreconsurg\/Abstract\/2016\/01000\/Diced_Cartilage_Grafts_Wrapped_in_Rectus_Abdominis.11.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/plasreconsurg\/2016\/01000\/Diced_Cartilage_Grafts_Wrapped_in_Rectus_Abdominis.11.pdf","pmid":"26368329","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"43","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Diced Cartilage Grafts Wrapped in Rectus Abdominis Fascia for Nasal Dorsum Augmentation","type":"article","volume":"137","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diced-cartilage-grafts-wrapped-rectus-abdominis-fascia-nasal-dorsum-augmentation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6992211,"mean":6.2499931892752,"rank":6001929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6992211,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302338,"mean":9.0112488646773,"rank":247677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302338,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4300,"mean":6.8048792742498,"rank":3451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4300,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147,"mean":11.360479452055,"rank":112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
