Hence, mitigation of such postoperative pain assumes importance. Among the various agents employed for such mitigation, opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have for some time taken center stage. However, alas they are not without their share of adverse effects. This study was undertaken with the purpose of elucidating the efficacy of intravenous (IV) paracetamol as compared to IV tramadol in mitigating postoperative pain while observing its effect on hemodynamic stability and the presence of adverse drug reactions, if any.\nA total of 60 randomized cases aged ranges from 20 to 60 years of both sexes divided into two groups (each for paracetamol and tramadol) scheduled for laparotomies were administered IV paracetamol and tramadol for postoperative pain relief and assessed with visual analog scale (VAS) score and variations in vital parameters to ascertain extent of pain relief and post-operative nausea vomiting (PONV).\nData so collected was statistically interpreted, and observations extrapolated. Save for a perceptible decline in PONV with paracetamol group compared with tramadol group with a statistically significant P < 0.001, nothing statistically significant was observed in any other parameter, including VAS scores between either group.\nIV paracetamol is a safer alternative to tramadol with lesser PONV in the postoperative period translates into the lesser duration of hospitalization and hence earlier discharge.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51a3cf058f6100038be","authors":["Shahid, Mohammed","Manjula, B P","Sunil, B V"],"doi":"10.4103\/0259-1162.158005","first_seen_on":"2015-12-30T11:02:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0259-1162"],"issue":"3","journal":"Anesthesia: Essays & Researches","last_mentioned_on":1451475068,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26712966?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC4683489","pmid":"26712966","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"A comparative study of intravenous paracetamol and intravenous tramadol for postoperative analgesia in laparotomies.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-study-intravenous-paracetamol-intravenous-tramadol-postoperative-analgesia-laparotomies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6892495,"mean":6.1874169550219,"rank":5904812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6892495,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300539,"mean":8.9656723143161,"rank":244307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300539,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":1.541976744186,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.8775,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/682154571095916544","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4936728],"posted_on":"2015-12-30T11:01:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
