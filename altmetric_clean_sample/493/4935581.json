A screening survey identified women with recent drug use and IPV in the emergency department (ED). Participants were randomized to BSAFER or a Web-based control program and booster call providing education about home fire safety. Program completion, usability, satisfaction and MI adherence were primary outcomes. Drug use and IPV outcomes were measured at baseline, one and three months.\nForty women were enrolled (21 BSAFER, 19 control); 50% were non-white and mean age was 30\u00a0years. Most commonly used drugs were marijuana (88%) and cocaine (30%); 45% reported physical abuse and 33% severe combined physical and sexual abuse. Thirty-nine (98%) completed the Web program, 30 (75%) completed the booster, and 29 (73%) completed 3-month follow up. Mean System Usability Scale (SUS) for the BSAFER Web program was 84 (95% CI 78-89) of 100; mean Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) was 28 (95% CI 26-29) of 32. MI adherence scores were high and similar for both the Web program and the booster. Both intervention and control groups had small mean decreases in weekly drug use days (0.7\u00a0days vs. 1.5\u00a0days); participants using drugs other than marijuana demonstrated greater average reductions in drug use than those using marijuana only.\nAn ED Web-based intervention for SUD and IPV in women demonstrated feasibility and acceptability. Future studies will examine efficacy of the BSAFER program and investigate whether specific subgroups of drug using women may be most responsive to ED-based Web interventions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cb3cf058f6100003a1","authors":["Esther K Choo"],"doi":"10.1080\/08897077.2015.1134755","first_seen_on":"2015-12-30T01:15:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1547-0164"],"journal":"Substance Abuse","last_mentioned_on":1452099273,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/eprint\/bM6tkXCrmXn7XcA7FY34\/full"],"pmid":"26714233","pubdate":"2015-12-30T22:00:08+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"B-SAFER: A Web-Based Intervention for Drug Use and Intimate Partner Violence Demonstrates Feasibility and Acceptability Among Women in the Emergency Department","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bsafer-webbased-intervention-drug-intimate-partner-violence-demonstrates-feasibility-acceptability-a-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6912770,"mean":6.208179930211,"rank":1078882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":5830952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6912770,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301116,"mean":8.9802762798265,"rank":59538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":241366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301116,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301,"mean":5.0404266666667,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":5.9946,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
