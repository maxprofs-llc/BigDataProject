The surface ultrastructure of this species consists of three main forms of microtriches: papilliform filitriches, acicular filitriches and quadridigitate to octadigitate palmate spinitriches. The bothria are covered with palmate spinitriches interspersed on some parts with papilliform filitriches. Palmate spinitriches with papilliform, acicular and capilliform filitriches adorn the pars vaginalis and at the anterior part of the pars bulbosa, there is a transition zone in which the palmate spinitriches are replaced by papilliform to acicular filitriches towards the end of the scolex. ANOVA tests with Duncan's post hoc analyses revealed that there are significant differences in the length of spinitriches and their prongs, whether on the surfaces of the bothria or on the surfaces of the scolex peduncle. Callitetrarhynchus gracilis Pintner, 1931 is the second lacistorhynchid species for which surfaces of the segments were examined and the occurrence of large structures called scutes are reported for the first time from this species. There were also significant differences in the base length as well as height of the scutes in different parts of the strobila. In addition to describing the surface ultrastructures of the two lacistorhynchid species, all the available information on the microtriches within the family Lacistorhynchidae is reviewed herein and generic diagnoses related to microtriches are amended.
