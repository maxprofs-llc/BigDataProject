Patients without cardiovascular diseases and in 1 and 2 American Society of Anesthesiologists were divided into two groups. Treatment group received 600 mg capsule (gabapentin) 1 h before surgery and the control group received placebo. The severity of nausea and vomiting were evaluated according to 4 Scores every hour to 4 h after the withdrawal of mother from the recovery section.\nIn this study, there is no significant difference in demographic information between these two groups. In the 1(st) h, there is a significant difference between the severity of nausea and vomiting in these two groups, but there is not a significant difference between 2 and 4 h after surgery. However, the incidence of nausea between the two groups shows a significant correlation.\nA single dose of gabapentin 1 h before cesarean delivery decreases the incidence of nausea and vomiting after surgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51a3cf058f6100038be","authors":["Memari, Fereshteh","Jadidi, Rahmatollah","Noroozi, Afsaneh","Mohammadbeigi, Abolfazl","Falahati, Jamal"],"doi":"10.4103\/0259-1162.157469","first_seen_on":"2015-12-30T11:11:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0259-1162"],"issue":"3","journal":"Anesthesia: Essays & Researches","last_mentioned_on":1451474140,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26712982?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC4683503","pmid":"26712982","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Protecting effect of gabapentin for nausea and vomiting in the surgery of cesarean after spinal anesthesia.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protecting-effect-gabapentin-nausea-vomiting-surgery-cesarean-after-spinal-anesthesia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6892495,"mean":6.1874169550219,"rank":5904792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6892495,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300539,"mean":8.9656526828552,"rank":244295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300539,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":1.541976744186,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.8775,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/682156985630896128","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4936885],"posted_on":"2015-12-30T11:11:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
