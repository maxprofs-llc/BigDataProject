Traumatized children employ defensive strategies to survive when there is no \"good enough\" caregiver (D.W. Winnicott, , p. 94), and helping professionals can provide therapeutic experiences to develop or restore a child's sense of safety. With the case example of Anthony and his foster\/adoptive parents, I illustrate how to manage and contain a traumatized child's terror, rage, and grief through therapeutic sessions with the parent and child together, and supportive parental guidance. I promote attention to the child's ability to self-integrate and to regulate his own affect, and encourages secure-base parental responses that facilitate a child's shift toward secure attachment behavior.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ac2","authors":["RIBAUDO, JULIE","Ribaudo, Julie"],"doi":"10.1002\/imhj.21549","endpage":"92","first_seen_on":"2015-12-30T05:53:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1097-0355"],"issue":"1","journal":"Infant Mental Health Journal","last_mentioned_on":1451457332,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/imhj.21549"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/imhj.21549\/pdf","pmid":"26714611","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"80","title":"RESTORING SAFETY: AN ATTACHMENT\u2010BASED APPROACH TO CLINICAL WORK WITH A TRAUMATIZED TODDLER","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/restoring-safety-attachmentbased-approach-clinical-work-traumatized-toddler"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6892495,"mean":6.1874169550219,"rank":4892183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1753920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6892495,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300538,"mean":8.9656768584232,"rank":187351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":95421,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300538,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311,"mean":2.5109806451613,"rank":195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":3.1166666666667,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Student  > Ph.
