All cultures, pith callus and tumors with the exception of N. langsdorffii pith grew on this medium. Addition of glutamine to the medium resulted in highly organoid growth in N. langsdorffii pith. In order to have material comparable to other pith cultures, N. langsdorffii was initiated on 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid medium, after which it grows on complete medium as amorphous pith callus. Except for the initiation of N. langsdorffii (and N. glauca) pith, the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid medium, caused bleaching in cultures of T-37 induced tumors and death of B-6 induced tumors. Tumor cultures, except for the seedling tumor, grew well on a minimal medium lacking kinetin, indoleacetic acid, vitamins, glycine, and inositol. Glycine was necessary only in the growth of N. langsdorffii pith callus. A tissue culture model is presented which permits comparison of the various tissue types.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333b","authors":["Sharp, W R","Gunckel, J E"],"first_seen_on":"2017-03-03T07:42:55+00:00","issns":["0032-0889"],"issue":"7","journal":"Plant Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1488524395,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16657160"],"pmcid":"PMC396217","pmid":"16657160","pubdate":"1969-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Physiological Comparisons of Pith Callus With Crown-Gall and Genetic Tumors of Nicotiana glauca, N. langsdorffii, and N. glauca-langsdorffii Grown in Vitro.
