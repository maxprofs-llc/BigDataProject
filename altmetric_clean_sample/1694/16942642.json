Here, we demonstrate that N1-methyl-pseudouridine (N1m\u03a8) outperforms several other nucleoside modifications and their combinations in terms of translation capacity. Through extensive analysis of various modified transcripts in cell-free translation systems, we deconvolute the different components of the effect on protein expression independent of mRNA stability mechanisms. We show that in addition to turning off the immune\/eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of translation, the incorporated N1m\u03a8 nucleotides dramatically alter the dynamics of the translation process by increasing ribosome pausing and density on the mRNA. Our results indicate that the increased ribosome loading of modified mRNAs renders them more permissive for initiation by favoring either ribosome recycling on the same mRNA or de novo ribosome recruitment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["Svitkin, Yuri V.","Cheng, Yi Min","Chakraborty, Tirtha","Presnyak, Vladimir","John, Matthias","Sonenberg, Nahum","Yuri V.
