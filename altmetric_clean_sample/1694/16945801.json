This study was designed to assess the correlation between opium inhalation and cancer of the larynx and upper esophagus.\nFifty eight patients with laryngeal cancer, ninety eight patients with upper esophageal cancer and twenty seven healthy individuals with no evidence of head and neck or esophageal malignancies were selected from Otolaryngology and Radiation Oncology Department of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. Duration and amount of cigarette smoking and opium consumption were recorded through comprehensive interviews.\nThe crude odds ratio for laryngeal cancer was 5.58 (95% CI 2.05-15.15, P=0.000) in cigarette smokers relative to non-smokers and 9.09 (95% CI 3.21-25.64, P=0.000) in opium users relative to non-users. The crude odds ratio for esophageal cancer was 0.44 (95% CI 0.18-1.09, P=0.07) in cigarette smokers relative to non-smokers and 1.44 (95% CI 0.57-3.62, P=0.43) in opium users relative to non-users. After adjusting for smoking, the odds ratio for laryngeal cancer in opium users relative to non-users was 6.06 (95% CI 1.10-33.23, P=0.05). Laryngeal cancer was detected at a significantly lower age in opium users (54.54\u00b110.93 vs 62.92\u00b110.10 years, P=0.02) than in smokers. This effect was not observed in esophageal cancer. Although the duration (year 17.50\u00b114.84 vs 21.91\u00b114.03; P=0.34) and amount (pack\/day 0.625 vs 0.978; P=0.06) of smoking were higher among those who were opium dependent, these differences were not statistically significant (P=0.34 and P=0.06, respectively).\nOpium addiction by snuffing is an independent risk factor for the development laryngeal cancer but not esophageal cancer. Cigarette smoking increases this risk. Opium dependency increases the likelihood of developing laryngeal cancer at a younger age.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef792a83ee09648b5338","authors":["Mehdi Bakhshaee","Hamid Reza Raziee","Reza Afshari","Amin Amali","Mahmoud Roopoosh","Ali Lotfizadeh"],"first_seen_on":"2017-03-03T02:40:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2251-7251"],"issue":"90","journal":"Iranian Journal of Otorhinolaryngology","last_mentioned_on":1492444225,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5307300\/"],"pmid":"28229058","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences","startpage":"19","title":"Opium Addiction and Risk of Laryngeal and Esophageal Carcinoma.","type":"article","volume":"29"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8078137,"mean":6.8589454589436,"rank":4271269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2242105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8078137,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233317,"mean":13.791382519844,"rank":134856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":77326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233317,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":0.84210526315789,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":4}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Hlth_Literacy\/statuses\/837492761230180353","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16945801],"posted_on":"2017-03-03T02:40:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Health Literacy","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/731064960\/LiteracyII_normal.jpg","description":"Eclectic health info, Health Literacy  Also @HIV_Insight @Prison_Health, @Why_We_Do_That, @Sex_Worker_Hlth","id_on_source":"Hlth_Literacy","tweeter_id":"77314206","geo":{"lt":21.30694,"ln":-157.85833,"country":"US"},"followers":6036},"tweet_id":"837492761230180353"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Prison_Health\/statuses\/837492761532194816","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16945801],"posted_on":"2017-03-03T02:40:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Prison_Health","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/492953414\/Prison_normal.jpg","description":"Jail, Prison, Criminology, Corrections, et al Also @Hlth_Literacy @HIV_Insight, @Sex_Worker_Hlth","id_on_source":"Prison_Health","tweeter_id":"85601740","geo":{"lt":21.30694,"ln":-157.85833,"country":"US"},"followers":13693},"tweet_id":"837492761532194816"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HIV_Insight\/statuses\/837492762396278784","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16945801],"posted_on":"2017-03-03T02:40:09+00:00","author":{"name":"HIV Insight","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/587408973\/INSIGHT_ICON_normal.gif","description":"HIV, AIDS, STI, STD, HPV, Sexuality, LGBT, et al.
