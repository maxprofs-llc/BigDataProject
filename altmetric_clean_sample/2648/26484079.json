To our knowledge, no controlled feeding studies to date have evaluated the validity of urinary sodium, nitrogen, or sugar excretion as dietary biomarkers in adolescents.Objective: This investigation aimed to evaluate the validity of urinary sodium, nitrogen, and total sugars (TS) excretion as biomarkers for sodium, protein, and added sugars (AS) intake in nonobese adolescents.Methods: In a crossover controlled feeding study design, 33 adolescents [12-18 y of age, 47 \u00b1 25th percentile (mean \u00b1 SD) of body mass index (BMI; in kg\/m(2)) for age] consumed 5% AS [low added sugars (LAS)] and 25% AS [high added sugars (HAS)] isocaloric, macronutrient-matched (55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, and 15% protein) diets for 7 d each, in a randomly assigned order, with a 4-wk washout period between diets. On the final 2 d of each diet period, 24-h urine samples were collected. Thirty-two adolescents completed all measurements (97% retention).Results: Urinary sodium was not different from the expected 90% recovery (mean \u00b1 SD: 88% \u00b1 18%, P = 0.50). Urinary nitrogen was correlated with protein intake (r = 0.69, P < 0.001), although it was below the 80% expected recovery (62% \u00b1 7%, P < 0.001). Urinary TS values were correlated with AS intake during the HAS diet (r = 0.77, P < 0.001) and had a higher R(2) value of 0.28 than did AS intake (R(2) = 0.36). TS excretion differed between LAS (0.226 \u00b1 0.09 mg\/d) and HAS (0.365 \u00b1 0.16 mg\/d) feeding periods (P < 0.001).Conclusions: Urinary sodium appears to be a valid biomarker for sodium intake in nonobese adolescents. Urinary nitrogen is associated with protein intake, but nitrogen excretion rates were less than previously reported for adults, possibly owing to adolescent growth rates. TS excretion reflects AS at 25% AS intake and was responsive to the change in AS intake. Thus, urinary biomarkers are promising objective indicators of dietary intake in adolescents, although larger-scale feeding trials are needed to confirm these findings. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02455388.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8d","authors":["Lori B Moore","Sarah V Liu","Tanya M Halliday","Andrew P Neilson","Valisa E Hedrick","Brenda M Davy"],"doi":"10.3945\/jn.117.256875","first_seen_on":"2017-09-23T17:30:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0022-3166","1541-6100"],"journal":"Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1506364358,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3945\/%E2%80%8Bjn.117.256875","http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/early\/2017\/09\/20\/jn.117.256875.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/early\/2017\/09\/20\/jn.117.256875.full.pdf","pmid":"28931586","pubdate":"2017-09-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Nutrition","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Urinary Excretion of Sodium, Nitrogen, and Sugar Amounts Are Valid Biomarkers of Dietary Sodium, Protein, and High Sugar Intake in Nonobese Adolescents","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":4523023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2357715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120496,"mean":11.715960629072,"rank":64800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":43118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120496,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3983,"mean":14.295081366148,"rank":2838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3983,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":8.5645641025641,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1674240389274771&id=221736504525174","license":"public","citation_ids":[26484079],"posted_on":"2017-09-23T11:24:00+00:00","summary":"Cheaters Busted: Urinary Excretion of Sodium, Nitrogen, and Sugar Amounts Are Valid Biomarkers of Dietary Sodium, Protein, and High Sugar Intake in Nonobese Adolescents\n\n\"Thus, urinary biomarkers are promising objective indicators of dietary intake in adol","author":{"name":"SuppVersity","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/221736504525174","facebook_wall_name":"SuppVersity","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/221736504525174\/picture","id_on_source":"221736504525174"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NutritionNerd\/statuses\/912382955967959040","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26484079],"posted_on":"2017-09-25T18:27:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Tanya Halliday, PhD","url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/myncbi\/browse\/collection\/44186430\/?sort=date&direction=descending","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/728626840194064384\/xDGRf7rP_normal.jpg","description":"Registered Dietitian w\/PhD sharing reliable, relevant & realistic nutrition & exercise info.
