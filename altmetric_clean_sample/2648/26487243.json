Minutes per week of bout-related MVPA were calculated (\u2265\u20093 metabolic equivalents,\u2009\u2265\u200910-min bouts), and adherence to the national physical activity (PA) recommendation for WL maintenance (\u2265\u2009250 min\/wk) was assessed.\nIndependent of 1-year WL, 4-year MVPA (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.003, SE\u2009=\u20090.002, P\u2009=\u20090.006), but not 1-year MVPA (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.0001, SE\u2009=\u20090.001, P\u2009=\u20090.50), was significantly associated with 4-year WL. Compared with \"nonmaintainers\" (\u2265\u200910% WL at year 1, but\u2009<\u200910% at year 4; n\u2009=\u2009132), WL maintainers (\u2265\u200910% WL at years 1 and 4; n\u2009=\u2009103) had higher MVPA at year 1 (253.4\u2009\u00b1\u2009251.8 vs. 163.9\u2009\u00b1\u2009158.2 min\/wk, P\u2009=\u20090.002) and year 4 (155.3\u2009\u00b1\u2009180.6 vs. 111.4\u2009\u00b1\u2009154.5 min\/wk, P\u2009=\u20090.046). Although 38.8% and 22.3% of WL maintainers engaged in\u2009\u2265\u2009250 min\/wk at years 1 and 4, respectively, many engaged in\u2009<\u2009150 min\/wk (year 1: 41%, year 4: 61%).\nHigher weekly MVPA is associated with greater long-term WL and weight maintenance; however, many individuals are able to maintain\u2009\u2265\u200910% WL while engaging in little MVPA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000834f","authors":["Unick, Jessica L.","Gaussoin, Sarah A.","Hill, James O.","Jakicic, John M.","Bond, Dale S.","Hellgren, Margareta","Johnson, Karen C.","Peters, Anne L.","Coday, Mace","Kitzman, Dalane W.","Bossart, Suzette","Wing, Rena R.","Jessica L.
