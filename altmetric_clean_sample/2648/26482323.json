The incidence of ring-shaped dysphotopsia after hole ICL implantation was evaluated. In the experimental simulation study, non-sequential ray tracing was used to construct myopic human eye models with hole ICL and ICL without a central hole (conventional ICL). Simulated retinal images measured in log-scale irradiance were compared between the two ICLs for an extended Lambertian light-emitting disc object 20\u00a0cm in diameter placed 2\u00a0m from the corneal vertex. To investigate the causes of hole-induced dysphotopsia, a series of retinal images were simulated using point sources at infinity with well-defined field angles (0 to -20\u00b0) and multiple ICL models.\nOf 29 eyes, 15 experienced ring-shaped dysphotopsia after hole ICL implantation. The simulation study using an extended Lambertian source showed that hole ICL-evoked ring-shaped dysphotopsia was formed at a retinal field angle of \u00b140\u00b0. Component-level analysis using a well-defined off-axis point source from infinity revealed that ring-shaped dysphotopsia was generated by stray light refraction from the inner wall of the hole and the posterior ICL surface.\nHole ICL-evoked ring-shaped dysphotopsia was related to light refraction at the central hole structure. Surgeons are advised to explain to patients the possibility of ring-shaped dysphotopsia after hole ICL implantation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000215d","authors":["Youngsub Eom","Dae Wook Kim","Dongok Ryu","Jun-Heon Kim","Seul Ki Yang","Jong Suk Song","Sug-Whan Kim","Hyo Myung Kim"],"doi":"10.1111\/aos.13248","first_seen_on":"2017-09-23T16:00:23+00:00","issns":["1755375X"],"journal":"Acta Ophthalmologica (1755375X)","last_mentioned_on":1506189614,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27678470?dopt=Abstract&utm_content=buffer0e632&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27678470?dopt=Abstract&utm_content=bufferbb059&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"27678470","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Ring-shaped dysphotopsia associated with posterior chamber phakic implantable collamer lenses with a central hole","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ringshaped-dysphotopsia-associated-posterior-chamber-phakic-implantable-collamer-lenses-central-hole"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":7304707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116540,"mean":11.75113325153,"rank":95088,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116540,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":774,"mean":2.2220931435964,"rank":466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":774,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.35,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/joaquinfdezoft\/statuses\/911621218473832449","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26482323],"posted_on":"2017-09-23T16:00:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Joaqu\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez","url":"http:\/\/www.Qvision.es","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/694663628323164160\/7ab5trS0_normal.jpg","description":"CEO @ClinicasQvision.
