Participant groups were defined based on the share of consumed organic products; to discriminate between effects of food origin and food patterns, healthy diet indicators were considered in some statistical models.\nConsumption of organic food was associated with a more favourable pre-pregnancy BMI and lower prevalence of gestational diabetes. Compared with participants consuming no organic food (reference group), a marker of dairy products intake (pentadecanoic acid) and trans-fatty acids from natural origin (vaccenic and rumenic acids) were higher among participants consuming organic food (organic groups), whereas elaidic acid, a marker of the intake of trans-fatty acids found in industrially hydrogenated fats, was lower. Plasma levels of homocysteine and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were lower in the organic groups than in the reference group. Differences in pentadecanoic acid, vaccenic acid and vitamin D retained statistical significance when correcting for indicators of the healthy diet pattern associated with the consumption of organic food.\nConsumption of organic food during pregnancy is associated with several health-related characteristics and blood biomarkers. Part of the observed associations is explained by food patterns accompanying the consumption of organic food.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033f5","authors":["Sim\u00f5es-W\u00fcst, Ana Paula","Molt\u00f3-Puigmart\u00ed, Carolina","Jansen, Eugene HJM","van Dongen, Martien CJM","Dagnelie, Pieter C","Thijs, Carel","Ana Paula Sim\u00f5es-W\u00fcst","Carolina Molt\u00f3-Puigmart\u00ed","Eugene HJM Jansen","Martien CJM van Dongen","Pieter C Dagnelie","Carel Thijs"],"doi":"10.1017\/s1368980017001215","first_seen_on":"2017-06-20T15:15:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1368-9800","1475-2727"],"journal":"Public Health Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1504494000,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28625206?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28625206\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/S1368980017001215"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/services\/aop-cambridge-core\/content\/view\/ADE89D4DCF1A3521F2447C7102854D43\/S1368980017001215a.pdf\/div-class-title-organic-food-consumption-during-pregnancy-and-its-association-with-health-related-characteristics-the-koala-birth-cohort-study-div.pdf","pmid":"28625206","pubdate":"2017-06-20T22:10:34+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press (CUP)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["publichealth","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Organic food consumption during pregnancy and its association with health-related characteristics: the KOALA Birth Cohort Study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/organic-food-consumption-during-pregnancy-association-healthrelated-characteristics-koala-birth-coho"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":2.25,"3m":2.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":3526200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4780843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234716,"mean":12.847146939906,"rank":90884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":141289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234716,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1689,"mean":10.408793838863,"rank":938,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":732,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1689,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":9.5595744680851,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/megasimplefoods\/statuses\/877180507955511297","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21199170],"posted_on":"2017-06-20T15:05:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Justin","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1316043322\/foodss_normal.jpg","description":"Simple foods = good health.","id_on_source":"megasimplefoods","tweeter_id":"278152831","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2228},"tweet_id":"877180507955511297"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Bovidiva\/statuses\/889397274098503682","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21199170],"posted_on":"2017-07-24T08:10:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Jude Capper","url":"http:\/\/bovidiva.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/803920653212598272\/DmCIXwa0_normal.jpg","description":"Livestock #sustainability consultant.
