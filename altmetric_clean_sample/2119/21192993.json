More recent work suggests that these EMT-associated transcription factors also modulate the function of both embryonic and adult stem cells. Interestingly, YAP and TAZ, the co-transcriptional effectors of the Hippo pathway, likewise play an important role in stem cell self-renewal and lineage commitment. While direct intersections between the Snail\/Slug and Hippo pathways have not been described previously, we recently described an unexpected cooperative interaction between Snail\/Slug and YAP\/TAZ that controls the self-renewal and differentiation properties of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a cell population critical to bone development. Additional studies revealed that both Snail and Slug are able to form binary complexes with either YAP or TAZ that, together, control YAP\/TAZ transcriptional activity and function throughout mouse development. Given the more recent observations that MSC-like cell populations are found in association throughout the vasculature where they participate in tissue regeneration, fibrosis and cancer, the Snail\/Slug-YAP\/TAZ axis is well-positioned to regulate global stem cell function in health and disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e17","authors":["Yi Tang","Stephen J.
