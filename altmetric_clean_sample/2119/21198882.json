An adherence framework for decision aid trials is presented which includes two types of adherence: adherence to choice and adherence to treatment. Included studies were classified based on the adherence framework, and their impact on adherence was assessed.\nThirteen trials involving 2,122 patients were included. Of these 13, eight measured adherence to choice and 10 measured adherence to treatment. There was considerable heterogeneity in how adherence was measured, with studies varying in whether they considered baseline choice, follow-up choice, or neither, and whether they presented separate or aggregated adherence measures. No studies measuring adherence to choice reported significant differences between the decision aid and comparator, while four studies measuring adherence to treatment reported a statistically significant difference between the decision aid and comparator, with three favoring the decision aid arm.\nThe adherence framework provided insight into important measurement factors. There remains considerable heterogeneity in measures of adherence which makes it difficult to draw conclusions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cfd","authors":["Logan Trenaman","Anna Selva","Sophie Desroches","Kavita Singh","Janice Bissonnette","Nick Bansback","Dawn Stacey"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jclinepi.2016.03.032","first_seen_on":"2017-06-20T14:52:31+00:00","issns":["08954356"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1497971273,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27185074"],"pmid":"27185074","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["epidemiology"],"title":"A measurement framework for adherence in patient decision aid trials applied in a systematic review subanalysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measurement-framework-adherence-patient-decision-aid-trials-applied-systematic-review-subanalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":3987399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4223387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236858,"mean":12.923852991467,"rank":110811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":118927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236858,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1900,"mean":7.1192659294365,"rank":1411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1900,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":12.162407407407,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1,"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/anetto\/statuses\/877177291742359552","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21198882],"posted_on":"2017-06-20T14:52:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Annette McKinnon","url":"http:\/\/yourgoldwatch.blogspot.ca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/745352997685858304\/PZQteVmi_normal.jpg","description":"Health and patient voice blogger.
