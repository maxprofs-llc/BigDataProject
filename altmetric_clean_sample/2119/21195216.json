Studies in numerous murine models have demonstrated that HSPCs reside in distinct niches within the bone marrow environment. Whereas transplanted HSPCs travel through the bloodstream and home to sites of hematopoiesis, HSPCs can be mobilized from these niches into the blood either physiologically or induced by pharmaceutical drugs. Firstly, this review aims to give a synopsis of milestones defining niches and mobilization pathways for HSPCs, including the identification of several cell types involved such as osteoblasts, adventitial reticular cells, endothelial cells, monocytic cells, and granulocytic cells. The main factors that anchor HSPCs in the niche, and\/or induce their quiescence are vascular cell adhesion molecule(VCAM)-1, CD44, hematopoietic growth factors, e.g. stem cell factor (SCF) and FLT3 Ligand, chemokines including CXCL12, growth-regulated protein beta and IL-8, proteases, peptides, and other chemical transmitters such as nucleotides. In the second part of the review, we revise the current understanding of HSPC mobilization. Here, we discuss which mechanisms found to be active in HSPC mobilization correspond to the mechanisms relevant for HSPC interaction with niche cells, but also deal with other mediators and signals that target individual cell types and receptors to mobilize HSPCs. A multitude of questions remain to be addressed for a better understanding of HSPC biology and its implications for therapy, including more comprehensive concepts for regulatory circuits such as calcium homeostasis and parathormone, metabolic regulation such as by leptin, the significance of autonomic nervous system, the consequences of alteration of niches in aged patients, or the identification of more easily accessible markers to better predict the efficiency of HSPC mobilization.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008bdd","authors":["Rudolf Richter","Wolfgang Forssmann","Reinhard Henschler"],"doi":"10.1159\/000477262","first_seen_on":"2017-06-20T11:59:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1660-3796","1660-3818"],"issue":"3","journal":"Transfusion Medicine and Hemotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1497959946,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28626366?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5473067","pmid":"28626366","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Current Developments in Mobilization of Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells and Their Interaction with Niches in Bone Marrow","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/current-developments-mobilization-hematopoietic-stem-progenitor-cells-interaction-niches-bone-marrow"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":7258155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236858,"mean":12.923884233947,"rank":193728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236858,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":2.4002978723404,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":13.108,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HSC_papers\/statuses\/877133707638734848","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21195216],"posted_on":"2017-06-20T11:59:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Hematopoiesis","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/618441198634561537\/Y2u99HYj_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"HSC_papers","tweeter_id":"3271095818","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":85},"tweet_id":"877133707638734848"}]}}
