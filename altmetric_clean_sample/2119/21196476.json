Chrysin, as a flavone, has showed cancer chemopreventive activity. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of chrysin in cancer cells have not been fully understood. Objective In this study, we investigate expression levels of let-7a, miR-9, mir-18a, miR-21, miR-22, miR-34a, miR-126 and mir-221 to describe the anti-cancer effects of chrysin. Materials and Methods The cytotoxic effects of chrysin were assessed using MTT assay. The effect of chrysin on the microRNAs expression was determined by qRT-PCR. Results The MTT results for different concentrations of chrysin at different times on the Gastric carcinoma cells showed that IC50 for chrysin was 68.24\u2009\u00b5M after 24\u2009h of treatment. Expression analysis identified that miR-18, miR-21 and miR-221 were down regulated whereas let-7a, miR-9, miR-22, miR-34a and miR-126 were up regulated in Gastric carcinoma cell line (p<0.05). Conclusion Treatment with chrysin can alter the miRNAs expression and these findings might be an explanation for molecular mechanism of chrysin effect on gastric cancer.","altmetric_jid":"565496cd2a83ee7c2d8b4569","authors":["Mohammadian, Farideh","Pilehvar-Soltanahmadi, Younes","Alipour, Shahriar","Dadashpour, Mehdi","Zarghami, Nosratollah"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0042-119647","first_seen_on":"2017-06-20T13:00:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2194-9379","2194-9387"],"journal":"Drug Research","last_mentioned_on":1497963606,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28628924?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28628924","pubdate":"2017-06-20T22:00:14+00:00","publisher":"Thieme Publishing Group","title":"Chrysin Alters microRNAs Expression Levels in Gastric Cancer Cells: Possible Molecular Mechanism","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":7258172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236857,"mean":12.9239482977,"rank":193742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236857,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":1.6437209302326,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.4,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/877149057289904129","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21196476],"posted_on":"2017-06-20T13:00:06+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
