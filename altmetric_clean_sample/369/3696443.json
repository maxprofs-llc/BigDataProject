Of the 142 samples tested, 65 (45.8%) were identified as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) positive by a one-step reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The sequencing results of 258 nucleotides in ORF7 from 30 herds with PRRSV-positive samples revealed the circulation of six genetically different strains of PRRSV, all belonging to the Subtype 1 (Type I). Twenty-three (76.6%) of the thirty positive herds were infected with a genetically identical cluster, with 98.9-100% nucleotide identity between the herds, representing the detection of a new strain of PRRSV in Europe, not published previously. From these 23 herds, positive PRRSV samples were detected with gel-based RT-PCR, but all gave false-negative results with two commercial real-time kits. When using a third commercial real-time kit, 28 (93.3%) of 30 positive samples in gel-based RT-PCR were detected as the Type I, confirming that the sensitivity of this real-time kit is much greater than the sensitivity of the previous two. The influence of new genetic variants of PRRSV circulating in Slovenia on molecular diagnosis and the control of the infection is discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f91","doi":"10.1016\/j.jviromet.2011.09.019","first_seen_on":"2015-02-16T03:12:25+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","last_mentioned_on":1461667123,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jviromet.2011.09.019"],"pmid":"22001545","pubdate":"2011-10-18T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Identification of a genetically diverse sequence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in Slovenia and the impact on the sensitivity of four molecular tests.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-genetically-diverse-sequence-porcine-reproductive-respiratory-syndrome-virus-slovenia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7607694,"mean":6.5509374902442,"rank":1844302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4749696,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7607694,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211758,"mean":8.8926505664513,"rank":62912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":145044,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211758,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":650,"mean":2.0087889060092,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":650,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.79,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
