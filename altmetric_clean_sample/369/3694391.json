Designated C. freundii biotype 4280, this bacterium is the etiologic agent of transmissible murine clonic hyperplasia. An eaeA gene has been shown to be present in this organism and to be necessary for virulence in laboratory mice. However, other biotypes of C. freundii lack DNA homology with the eaeA gene. Because of the recent reclassification in which five named species and three unnamed species, all previously considered C. freundii, were described, we determined the taxonomic status of C. freundii biotype 4280. With a battery of biochemical tests and DNA relatedness studies, three isolates of C. freundii biotype 4280 were shown to be members of an unnamed Citrobacter species, designated species 9. In total, six isolates of Citrobacter species 9, but none of the type strains of the other eight named species or of the two remaining unnamed species of Citrobacter, were shown to possess DNA homology with both the eaeA and the eaeB genes. Species 9 was named Citrobacter rodentium sp. nov.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be9","authors":["D B Schauer","B A Zabel","I F Pedraza","C M O'Hara","A G Steigerwalt","D J Brenner"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-16T02:09:31+00:00","issns":["1098-660X","0095-1137"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1400509756,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org\/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=7559949","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7559949","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC228336"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jcm.asm.org\/content\/33\/8\/2064.full.pdf","pmid":"7559949","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Genetic and biochemical characterization of Citrobacter rodentium sp. nov.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-biochemical-characterization-citrobacter-rodentium-sp-nov-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3761091,"mean":4.9967980138772,"rank":857427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2379540,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3761091,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110405,"mean":9.3874496395059,"rank":33638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":75558,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110405,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2501,"mean":2.6355464,"rank":320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":1630,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2501,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":2.4227941176471,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
