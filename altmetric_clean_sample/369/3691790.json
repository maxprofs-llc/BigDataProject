Subsequently these compounds became leads in our JAK2 project. Macrocycles with a basic nitrogen in the linker form a salt bridge with Asp86 in CDK2 and Asp698 in FLT3. This residue is conserved in most CDKs resulting in potent pan CDK inhibition. One of the main project objectives was to achieve JAK2 potency with 100-fold selectivity against CDKs. Macrocycles with an ether linker have potent JAK2 activity with the ether oxygen forming a hydrogen bond to Ser936. A hydrogen bond to the equivalent residues of JAK3 and most CDKs cannot be formed resulting in good selectivity for JAK2 over JAK3 and CDKs. Further optimization of the macrocyclic linker and side chain increased JAK2 and FLT3 activity as well as improving DMPK properties. The selective JAK2\/FLT3 inhibitor 11 (Pacritinib, SB1518) has successfully finished phase 2 clinical trials for myelofibrosis and lymphoma. Another selective JAK2\/FLT3 inhibitor, 33 (SB1578), has entered phase 1 clinical development for the non-oncology indication rheumatoid arthritis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012JCAMD..26..437P","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d2a","authors":["Anders Poulsen","Anthony William","St\u00e9phanie Blanchard","Angeline Lee","Harish Nagaraj","Haishan Wang","Eeling Teo","Evelyn Tan","Kee Chuan Goh","Brian Dymock"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10822-012-9572-z","first_seen_on":"2015-02-16T01:00:15+00:00","issns":["1573-4951"],"journal":"Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design","last_mentioned_on":1398613618,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10822-012-9572-z"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10822-012-9572-z.pdf","pmid":"22527961","pubdate":"2012-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Anatomy \/ Morphology \/ Histology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computer Applications in Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Structure-based design of oxygen-linked macrocyclic kinase inhibitors: discovery of SB1518 and SB1578, potent inhibitors of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3)","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structurebased-design-oxygenlinked-macrocyclic-kinase-inhibitors-discovery-sb1518-sb1578-potent-inhi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3696029,"mean":4.9640595477123,"rank":837729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2334235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3696029,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101097,"mean":9.1991053849807,"rank":29606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":70383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101097,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204,"mean":4.3516256157635,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
