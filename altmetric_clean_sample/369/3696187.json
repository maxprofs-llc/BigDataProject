DsbC is a 2 x 23 kDa homodimer and has both protein disulfide isomerase and chaperone activity. We report the 1.9 A resolution crystal structure of oxidized DsbC where both Cys-X-X-Cys active sites form disulfide bonds. The molecule consists of separate thioredoxin-like domains joined via hinged linker helices to an N-terminal dimerization domain. The hinges allow relative movement of the active sites, and a broad uncharged cleft between them may be involved in peptide binding and DsbC foldase activities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003170","authors":["Peter Metcalf","Andrew A.
