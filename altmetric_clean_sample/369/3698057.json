Its apparent molecular mass was 66 kDa, as estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis. The purified enzyme had no detectable activity on various p-nitrophenyl glycosides and on native plant polysaccharides but exhibited a high activity on a (1-->3)-beta-D-linked galactan backbone obtained after partial acid hydrolysis and two Smith degradations of gum arabic. The optimum conditions were pH 4.5 and 40-50 degrees C. The enzyme had a Michaelis constant (Km) of 1.9 mg\/mL for the beta-(1-->3)-D-galactan with a maximum reaction velocity (Vmax) of 1380 nkat\/mg. The study of the reaction products obtained after enzyme treatment of two galactans derived from gum arabic through one or two Smith degradations showed that it was an exo-(1-->3)-beta-D-galactanase able to by-pass the branching points of galactan backbones and thus to release the side-chains of type II arabinogalactans in an undegraded form.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024a5","authors":["P Pellerin","J M Brillouet"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-16T03:59:13+00:00","issns":["0008-6215"],"issue":"2","journal":"Carbohydrate Research","last_mentioned_on":1365872972,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7805066"],"pmid":"7805066","pubdate":"1994-11-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","biochemistry"],"title":"Purification and properties of an exo-(1-->3)-beta-D-galactanase from Aspergillus niger.","type":"article","volume":"264","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/purification-properties-exo13betadgalactanase-aspergillus-niger"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628651,"mean":4.9397870194191,"rank":816934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628651,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90226,"mean":8.5451995566641,"rank":24047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":65206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90226,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267,"mean":1.9612706766917,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Galactan 1,3-beta-galactosidase","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=550180701#altmetric_citation_1","license":"public","citation_ids":[3698054,3698057],"posted_on":"2013-04-13T17:09:32+00:00","summary":"This enzyme removes not only free galactose, but also 6-glycosylated residues.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=39100985","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Dcirovic","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Dcirovic"}}]}}
