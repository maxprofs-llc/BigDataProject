The Echo7 strain, DH22G\/JS\/2012 was isolated from a 32-month-old boy who was clinically diagnosed with HFMD. The complete genome sequence of this isolate was determined after the virus was propagated in cell culture. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the subgroups B1 and C1 prevailed in mainland China from 1998 to 2012 and that the subgroup B2 began to circulate in mainland China in 2009. The result of Simplot analysis showed that the Echo7 strain DH22G\/JS\/2012 is a recombinant coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) that circulated in mainland China in 2010.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000230f","authors":["Xin Yao","Lian-Lian Bian","Qun-Ying Mao","Feng-Cai Zhu","Qiang Ye","Zheng-Lun Liang"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00705-015-2350-1","first_seen_on":"2015-02-16T01:23:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-8798"],"journal":"Archives of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1424014697,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25680567?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25680567","pubdate":"2015-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Virology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Echovirus 7 associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease in mainland China has undergone a recombination event.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/echovirus-7-associated-hand-foot-mouth-disease-mainland-china-undergone-recombination-event"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4760465,"mean":5.7118068230344,"rank":3983396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4760465,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152966,"mean":9.6952139770538,"rank":126011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152966,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":857,"mean":2.0634789719626,"rank":632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":857,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":2.5382711864407,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
