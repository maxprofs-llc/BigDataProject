During a period of more than 3 years, 58 cases of Psychosis NOS or unspecified psychosis had been diagnosed and during a follow-up of more than 3 years, 21% cases developed Affective disorders, 16% cases developed reactive psychosis and 9% were diagnosed Schizophrenia during subsequent course of illness. 55% cases maintained the diagnosis of psychosis NOS. Unspecified psychosis seems to be a heterogeneous group with diagnostic change occurring in 45% of cases. Unspecified Psychosis was noticed to be more in the younger people. No demographic variable had any significant association with the clinical variables.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5263cf058f610003d93","authors":["S.K. Chaturvedi","R.N.
