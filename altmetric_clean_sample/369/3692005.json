Directed phytase evolution was reported for improving industrial relevant properties such as thermostability (pelleting process) or activity. In this study, we report the cloning, characterization, and directed evolution of the Yersinia mollaretii phytase (Ymphytase). Ymphytase has a tetrameric structure with positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient was 2.3) and a specific activity of 1,073\u00a0U\/mg which is \u223c10 times higher than widely used fungal phytases. High-throughput prescreening methods using filter papers or 384-well microtiter plates were developed. Precise subsequent screening for thermostable and active phytase variants was performed by combining absorbance and fluorescence-based detection system in 96-well microtiter plates. Directed evolution yielded after mutant library generation (SeSaM method) and two-step screening (in total \u223c8,400 clones) a phytase variant with \u223c20% improved thermostability (58\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min; residual activity wild type \u223c34%; variant \u223c53%) and increased melting temperature (1.5\u00b0C) with a slight loss of specific activity (993\u00a0U\/mg).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022dc","authors":["Amol V.
