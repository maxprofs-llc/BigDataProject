Most of these databases are either dedicated to a single species or to a single disease of interest. With the advent of technologies to generate phenotypes in a high-throughput manner, not only is the volume of phenotype data growing fast but also the need to organize these data in more useful ways. We have created PhenomicDB (freely available at http:\/\/www.phenomicdb.de), a multi-species genotype\/phenotype database, which shows phenotypes associated with their corresponding genes and grouped by gene orthologies across a variety of species. We have enhanced PhenomicDB recently by additionally incorporating quantitative and descriptive RNA interference (RNAi) screening data, by enabling the usage of phenotype ontology terms and by providing information on assays and cell lines. We envision that integration of classical phenotypes with high-throughput data will bring new momentum and insights to our understanding. Modern analysis tools under development may help exploiting this wealth of information to transform it into knowledge and, eventually, into novel therapeutic approaches.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["Philip Groth","Nadia Pavlova","Ivan Kalev","Spas Tonov","Georgi Georgiev","Hans-Dieter Pohlenz","Bertram Weiss"],"doi":"10.1093\/nar\/gkl662","first_seen_on":"2015-02-16T01:22:08+00:00","issns":["1362-4962"],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","last_mentioned_on":1300358055,"links":["http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/cgi\/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16982638","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/nar\/gkl662","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16982638","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1781118"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/35\/suppl_1\/D696.full.pdf","pmid":"16982638","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"PhenomicDB: a new cross-species genotype\/phenotype resource","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phenomicdb-new-crossspecies-genotypephenotype-resource"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628651,"mean":4.9397870194191,"rank":816945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628651,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90222,"mean":8.5414384899305,"rank":24044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":65205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90222,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7704,"mean":3.0750266130079,"rank":1473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":3805,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7704,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":2.2828360655738,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Ph.
