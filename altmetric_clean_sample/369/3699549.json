The present post hoc analysis of pooled data from four placebo-controlled phase III studies assessed the effect of canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, on serum uric acid levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and in a subset of patients with hyperuricaemia [defined as baseline serum uric acid \u2265475\u2009\u00b5mol\/l (\u223c8\u2009mg\/dl)]. At week\u200926, canagliflozin 100 and 300\u2009mg were associated with a \u223c13% reduction in serum uric acid compared with placebo. In the subset of patients with hyperuricaemia, placebo-subtracted percent reductions in serum uric acid were similar to those in the overall cohort. More patients in the hyperuricaemic group achieved a serum uric acid level of <360\u2009\u00b5mol\/l (\u223c6\u2009mg\/dl) with both canagliflozin 100\u2009mg (23.5%) and 300\u2009mg (32.4%) compared with placebo (3.1%). Incidences of gout and kidney stones were low and similar across groups. In conclusion, canagliflozin treatment decreased serum uric acid in patients with T2DM, including those with baseline hyperuricaemia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026fc","authors":["Davies MJ","Trujillo A","Vijapurkar U","Damaraju CV","Meininger G","Davies, M.
