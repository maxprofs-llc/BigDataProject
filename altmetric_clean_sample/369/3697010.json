In the last 20 years, approximately 1,000 CDG patients have been identified presenting with multiple organ dysfunctions. This review sets the state of the art by listing all mutations identified in the 15 genes (PMM2, MPI, DPAGT1, ALG1, ALG2, ALG3, ALG9, ALG12, ALG6, ALG8, DOLK, DPM1, DPM3, MPDU1, and RFT1) that yield a deficiency of dolichol-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis. The present analysis shows that most mutations lead to substitutions of strongly conserved amino acid residues across eukaryotes. Furthermore, the comparison between the different forms of CDG affecting dolichol-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis shows that the severity of the disease does not relate to the position of the mutated gene along this biosynthetic pathway.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f61000767d","authors":["Haeuptle, Micha A.","Hennet, Thierry","Haeuptle MA","Hennet T"],"doi":"10.1002\/humu.21126","first_seen_on":"2015-02-16T03:28:58+00:00","issns":["1098-1004","1059-7794","10981004","10597794"],"issue":"12","journal":"Human Mutation","last_mentioned_on":1463463337,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/humu.21126","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19862844"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/humu.21126\/pdf","pmid":"19862844","pubdate":"2009-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Congenital disorders of glycosylation: an update on defects affecting the biosynthesis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/congenital-disorders-glycosylation-update-defects-affecting-biosynthesis-dolichollinked-oligosacchar"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7711702,"mean":6.6147835493025,"rank":1878184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4809120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7711702,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":212455,"mean":8.9200698504145,"rank":63159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":145411,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":212455,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1404,"mean":3.361720598717,"rank":289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1404,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":4.9410714285714,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
