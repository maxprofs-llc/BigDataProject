All of the genes believed to be necessary for the biosynthesis of adenosylcobinamide from uroporphyrinogen III have now been isolated except two (cbiA and an as yet unidentified gene encoding cobalt reductase). Most of the genes are contained in two divergent operons, one of which, in turn, is closely linked to the operon encoding the B12-dependent enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. The close linkage of the three genes encoding the subunits of transcarboxylase to the hemYHBXRL gene cluster is reported. The functions of the P. freudenreichii B12 pathway genes are discussed, and a mechanism for the regulation of cobalamin and propionic acid production by oxygen in this organism is proposed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f610004208","authors":["Charles A Roessner","Ke-Xue Huang","Martin J Warren","Evelyne Raux","A Ian Scott"],"doi":"10.1099\/00221287-148-6-1845","first_seen_on":"2015-02-16T03:02:41+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1350-0872"],"issue":"Pt 6","journal":"Microbiology (13500872)","last_mentioned_on":1309768518,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12055304"],"pmid":"12055304","pubdate":"2002-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Isolation and characterization of 14 additional genes specifying the anaerobic biosynthesis of cobalamin (vitamin B12) in Propionibacterium freudenreichii (P. shermanii).","type":"article","volume":"148","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isolation-characterization-14-additional-genes-specifying-anaerobic-biosynthesis-cobalamin-vitamin-b"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629356,"mean":4.9352152798544,"rank":816514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629356,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90341,"mean":8.5641217843703,"rank":24093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":65271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90341,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":761,"mean":2.5966657894737,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":761,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.9730769230769,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
