There is no significant internal division of the Rhizobium clade to suggest that it represents more than one genus. Plant pathogenic (Agrobacterium) species are distributed within the genus. The analysis supported the synonymy of some species (Rhizobium gallicum and Rhizobium mongolense) and the need for comparative investigations of the tumorigenic and nodulating properties of Rhizobium tropici and Rhizobium rhizogenes. Misidentification of some sequences may conceal one or more putative novel species. Some sequences appear to be misidentified because of faulty sequencing or incomplete or inadequate analysis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c4","authors":["Young JM","Park DC","Weir BS","J YOUNG","D PARK","B WEIR"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.femsle.2004.07.026","endpage":"131","first_seen_on":"2015-02-16T00:40:58+00:00","issns":["0378-1097","03781097"],"issue":"1","journal":"FEMS Microbiology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1378075144,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.femsle.2004.07.026","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15336412"],"pmid":"15336412","pubdate":"2004-09-01T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"125","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Diversity of 16S rDNA sequences of Rhizobium spp. implications for species determinations.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1016\/j.femsle.2004.07.026","volume":"238","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diversity-16s-rdna-sequences-rhizobium-spp-implications-species-determinations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627464,"mean":4.9483847763613,"rank":817644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286485,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627464,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89879,"mean":8.476014041256,"rank":23883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":65020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89879,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":801,"mean":2.3844675,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":801,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.4714285714286,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
