In the last years a new vaccine against HZ became available in Italy. Therefore, the Italian decision makers are now confronted with the decision whether that vaccination should be implemented. Pharmaco-economic analyses represent useful tools to value the feasibility of new immunization programs and their sustainability. To this aim, an ad hoc population model was developed in order to value the clinical and economic impact of HZ vaccination program for the elderly in Italy. Particularly, different immunization scenarios were modelled: vaccination of 60\u00a0years-old subjects (single cohort strategy), simultaneous vaccination of people aged 60 and 65\u00a0years (double cohort strategy) and, lastly, immunization of people aged 60, 65 and 70\u00a0years (triple cohort strategy), thus leading to the vaccination of 5, 10 and 15 cohorts during the first five years of the program. The mathematical model valued the clinical impact of vaccination on the number of HZ, post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and ophthalmic HZ. The results of the analysis show that, in Italy, a cohort-based HZ vaccination program in elderly could have a relevant impact on the reduction of clinical cases and a favourable economic profile for the National Health Service (NHS), as already foreseen in other countries. In addition, further benefits could be obtained when extending the study period beyond the 5-year horizon of our analysis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9343cf058f61000dea9","authors":["Sara Boccalini","Cristiano Alicino","Domenico Martinelli","Angela Bechini","Emilia Tiscione","Barbara Pellizzari","Rosa Prato","Giancarlo Icardi","Stefania Iannazzo","Paolo Bonanni"],"doi":"10.1080\/21645515.2017.1264832","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2017-01-13T07:38:00+00:00","issns":["2164-554X","2164-5515"],"journal":"Human vaccines immunotherapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1484292983,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/eprint\/CkkUsim5hYUKheQhtfdU\/full"],"pmid":"27925856","pubdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Clinical and economic impact of herpes zoster vaccination in elderly in Italy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-economic-impact-herpes-zoster-vaccination-elderly-italy-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069307,"mean":6.8479199559378,"rank":4268080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2237621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069307,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255047,"mean":12.814958776064,"rank":144192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":85896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255047,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1053,"mean":4.8009163498099,"rank":461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1053,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":2.9923076923077,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CriAlicino\/statuses\/819810307748966400","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15439791],"posted_on":"2017-01-13T07:36:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Cristiano Alicino","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/608971204922322945\/jkp7mfvg_normal.jpg","description":"Medico di Sanit\u00e0 Pubblica.
