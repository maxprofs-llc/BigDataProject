After wound closure, the anterior eye segment was visualized using the incorporated 3-D SD-OCT. Visualization of Berger space was performed in the axial and sagittal planes.\nThe study comprised 165 consecutive eyes. In 155 eyes, 3-D SD-OCT visualized Berger space and its dimensions were analyzed. In 72% of the cases, Berger space was large enough to perform a femtosecond laser-assisted primary posterior capsulotomy. In 24 eyes (15.5%) with a minimum axial length of 25.0\u00a0mm, Berger space was 500\u00a0\u03bcm or larger.\nFemtosecond laser systems incorporating real-time SD-OCT allowed direct visualization of Berger space intraoperatively, providing surgeons with the information needed to safely create posterior capsulotomies after intraocular lens implantation.\nDr. Dick is a consultant to Abbott Medical Optics, Inc.
