We investigated the cerebral metabolic and haemodynamic changes following neonatal stroke in a term infant at 24\u00a0h of life. Changes in oxidation state of cytochrome-c-oxidase (oxCCO) concentration were monitored along with changes in oxy- and deoxy- haemoglobin using a new broadband near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system. Repeated transient changes in cerebral haemodynamics and metabolism were noted over a 3-h study period with decrease in oxyhaemoglobin (HbO2), deoxy haemoglobin (HHb) and oxCCO in both cerebral hemispheres without significant changes in systemic observations. A clear asymmetry was noted in the degree of change between the two cerebral hemispheres. Changes in cerebral oxygenation (measured as HbDiff\u2009=\u2009HbO2 -\u2009HHb) and cerebral metabolism (measured as oxCCO) were highly coupled on the injured side of the brain.","aggregated_in":[5300678],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd24","authors":["Mitra, S","Subhabrata Mitra","Gemma Bale","Judith Meek","Sean Mathieson","Cristina Uria","Giles Kendall","Nicola J.
