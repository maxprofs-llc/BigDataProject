Here, we conduct a genome-wide association scan on 771 German PEX patients and 1,350 controls, followed by independent testing of associated variants in Italian and Japanese data sets. We focus on a 3.5-kb four-component polymorphic locus positioned spanning introns 1 and 2 of LOXL1 with enhancer-like chromatin features. We find that the rs11638944:C>G transversion exerts a cis-acting effect on the expression levels of LOXL1, mediated by differential binding of the transcription factor RXR\u03b1 (retinoid X receptor alpha) and by modulating alternative splicing of LOXL1, eventually leading to reduced levels of LOXL1 mRNA in cells and tissues of risk allele carriers. These findings uncover a functional mechanism by which common noncoding variants influence LOXL1 expression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Pasutto, Francesca","Zenkel, Matthias","Hoja, Ursula","Berner, Daniel","Uebe, Steffen","Ferrazzi, Fulvia","Sch\u00f6del, Johannes","Liravi, Panah","Ozaki, Mineo","Paoli, Daniela","Frezzotti, Paolo","Mizoguchi, Takanori","Nakano, Satoko","Kubota, Toshiaki","Manabe, Shinichi","Salvi, Erika","Manunta, Paolo","Cusi, Daniele","Gieger, Christian","Wichmann, Heinz-Erich","Aung, Tin","Khor, Chiea Chuen","Kruse, Friedrich E.","Reis, Andr\u00e9","Schl\u00f6tzer-Schrehardt, Ursula","Francesca Pasutto","Matthias Zenkel","Ursula Hoja","Daniel Berner","Steffen Uebe","Fulvia Ferrazzi","Johannes Sch\u00f6del","Panah Liravi","Mineo Ozaki","Daniela Paoli","Paolo Frezzotti","Takanori Mizoguchi","Satoko Nakano","Toshiaki Kubota","Shinichi Manabe","Erika Salvi","Paolo Manunta","Daniele Cusi","Christian Gieger","Heinz-Erich Wichmann","Tin Aung","Chiea Chuen Khor","Friedrich E.
