Pregnant young women's attitudes about grandmothers' and fathers' role in decision-making and their involvement in microbicide use were assessed. Participants (n=108) had a mean age of 20.2 years. The majority anticipated that the grandmother, father or both would have a decision-making role. Greater grandmother involvement in microbicide use was significantly associated with being younger, having no reproductive tract infection or contraceptive-ring-use history. Greater father involvement in use was associated with being in a relationship with him. Strategies for engaging grandmothers and fathers in microbicide use should be developed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f61000891a","authors":["Jenny K. R.
