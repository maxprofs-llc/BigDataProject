Addictive drug reinforcement and stress signaling involve common neural circuitry, including the mesolimbic dopamine system. We demonstrate in rodents that pre-exposure to stress attenuates alcohol-induced dopamine responses and increases alcohol self-administration. The blunted dopamine signaling resulted from ethanol-induced excitation of GABA neurons in the ventral tegmental area. Excitation of GABA neurons was mediated by GABAA receptor activation and involved stress-induced functional downregulation of the K(+), Cl(-) cotransporter, KCC2. Blocking stress hormone receptors, enhancing KCC2 function, or preventing excitatory GABA signaling by alternative methods all prevented the attenuated alcohol-induced dopamine response and prevented the increased alcohol self-administration. These results demonstrate that stress alters the neural and behavioral responses to alcohol through a neuroendocrine signal that shifts inhibitory GABA transmission toward excitation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319c","authors":["Ostroumov, Alexey","Thomas, Alyse M","Kimmey, Blake A","Karsch, Jordan S","Doyon, William M","Dani, John A","Alexey Ostroumov","Alyse\u00a0M.
