C. salebrosa was found in a stream (Shell Creek, Florida) and a slightly brackish lake (Laguna del Rincon, Dominican Republic; salinity\u00a0<0.7\u00a0psu) while C. americana occurred in a coastal lake with polyhaline waters (Parrotee Pond, Jamaica; salinity:\u00a0>20\u00a0psu). Valve size and position of nodes differed between the two species. A reverse temperature dependency have been considered to influence Shell length (seasonally in Shell Creek, summer: 1076\u00a0\u00b5m; winter: 1092\u00a0\u00b5m, supposedly permanently in Laguna del Rincon, 1035\u00a0\u00b5m). But, regarding the small dataset other factors could not be excluded to influence ostracod valve size. A decline of node frequency of C. salebrosa is mainly related to an increase in salinity. Isotopic values of ostracod valves reflect the trend in stable isotopes of their host water. Variations in Cyprideis salebrosa \u03b4(18)O and \u03b4(13)C values signify differences in their host water. Offsets of ostracod valves to a theoretical calcite precipitated in their host water with an uncertain time lag (+0.015 to +2.63\u00a0\u2030) needs to be clarified. This study presents a contribution to the understanding of environmental influences on modern ostracod shell characters as basis for paleontological applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fc3cf058f610003017","authors":["J.
