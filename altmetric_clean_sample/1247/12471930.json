We generated confidence limits for our estimates by performing a simulation study.\nData were obtained from published, nationally-representative estimates from CDC. Model parameters included the annual numbers of HIV-infected pregnant women, the annual numbers of perinatally-infected infants, the annual proportions of infants exposed to antiretroviral drugs during the prenatal and intrapartum period, and the estimated mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rate in the absence of preventive interventions. For the simulation study, model parameters were assigned distributions and we performed 1,000,000 repetitions.\nBetween 1978 and 2010, an estimated 186,157 (95% CI: 185,312-187,003) HIV-exposed infants and approximately 21,003 (95% CI: 20.179-21,288) infected infants were born in the United States. Between 1994 and 2010, an estimated 124,342 (95% CI: 123,651-125,034) HIV-exposed infants were born in the U.S., and approximately 6,083 (95% CI: 5,931-6,236) infants were perinatally infected with HIV. During this same period about 100,207 (95% CI: 99,374-101,028) infants were prenatally exposed to antiretroviral drugs. As a result of PMTCT interventions, an estimated 21,956 (95% CI: 20,191-23,759) MTCT HIV cases have been prevented in the US since 1994.\nThough continued vigilance is needed to eliminate mother-to-child HIV transmission, PMTCT interventions have prevented nearly 22,000 cases of perinatal HIV transmission in the United States since 1994.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008487","authors":["Little, Kristen M.","Taylor, Allan W.","Borkowf, Craig B.","Mendoza, Maria C.B.","Lampe, Margaret A.","Weidle, Paul J.","Nesheim, Steven R.","Little, Kristen M","Taylor, Allan W","Borkowf, Craig B","Mendoza, Maria C B","Lampe, Margaret A","Weidle, Paul J","Nesheim, Steven R","Kristen M.
