Field-collected engorged females exhibited mean fecundity of 82.45\u2009\u00b1\u20094.00. The highest rate of emergence and largest adults were obtained in T1, and the lowest rate of emergence was observed in T4. Two-way analyses of variance with post hoc Tukey tests showed significant differences in age at pupation, pupal weight and wing length among the various treatments, although the sex ratio was 1\u2009:\u20091 in all food\/substrate combinations. The successful rearing of immature C.\u2009peregrinus is an encouraging step towards the establishment of a laboratory colony of this prevalent species associated with livestock.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f610003091","authors":["Harsha, R","Mazumdar, A"],"doi":"10.1111\/mve.12136","endpage":"438","first_seen_on":"2015-09-24T13:43:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1365-2915"],"issue":"4","journal":"Medical & Veterinary Entomology","last_mentioned_on":1470765515,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26396058?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26396058?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26396058","pubdate":"2015-09-24T22:01:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"434","title":"Laboratory rearing of immature Culicoides peregrinus Kieffer, a potential vector of bluetongue virus.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laboratory-rearing-immature-culicoides-peregrinus-kieffer-potential-vector-bluetongue-virus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187659,"mean":6.9230329122133,"rank":6216382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1101982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187659,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237667,"mean":9.4739034022536,"rank":162779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237667,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":577,"mean":3.7065659722222,"rank":486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":577,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":10.107571428571,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
