This study focused on MHC association of genes with pediatric-onset IBD and its different phenotypes.\nBlood samples of 103 patients with pediatric IBD (Crohn's disease [CD] or ulcerative colitis [UC]) were collected at Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, Finland. HLA-A, -B, -DRB1 alleles and complement C4A and C4B gene copy numbers were determined and constructed into haplotypes by a Bayesian algorithm (PHASE). A general population cohort (n\u200a=\u200a149) served as a control. HLA-alleles and C4 deficiency frequencies were compared between patients and controls with Chi-squared and Fisher's exact test with Bonferroni correction (pcorr).\nOne MHC haplotype HLA-A03;HLA-B07;one C4A gene;one C4B gene;HLA-DRB115 was more common in CD and UC than in controls (7\/61, 11.5%, 6\/42, 14.3% and 1\/149, 0.7% respectively, OR\u200a=\u200a19.19, 95%CI\u200a=\u200a2.31-159.57, pcorr\u200a=\u200a0.004 for CD vs. controls and OR\u200a=\u200a24.67, 95%CI\u200a=\u200a2.88-211.36, pcorr\u200a=\u200a0.002 for UC vs. controls). Two MHC markers were associated with clinical characteristics. HLA-DRB101 was more common in patients with milder disease course, i.e. no need for anti-TNF-\u03b1 medication (18\/32, 56.2% vs. 19\/71, 26.8% without and with anti-TNF-\u03b1 medication, respectively, OR\u200a=\u200a0.28, 95%CI\u200a=\u200a0.12-0.68, pcorr\u200a=\u200a0.032). C4B deficiency (<2 C4B genes) was associated with complicated recovery after surgery (12\/16, 75.0% vs. 4\/16, 25.0%, respectively, OR\u200a=\u200a9.00, 95%CI\u200a=\u200a1.82-44.59, pcorr\u200a=\u200a0.025).\nOne MHC haplotype is strongly linked with pediatric-onset IBD, whereas the need for immunomodulatory therapy, and surgery outcome associate with other distinct MHC gene markers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dcf","authors":["Kolho, Kaija-Leena","Paakkanen, Riitta","Docent, Anna Lepist\u00f6","Wennerst\u00f6m, Annika","Meri, Seppo","Lokki, Marja-Liisa","Lepist\u00f6, Anna"],"doi":"10.1097\/mpg.0000000000000984","first_seen_on":"2015-09-24T15:52:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-4801","0277-2116"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology & Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1486034344,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26398154","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jpgn\/Fulltext\/2016\/04000\/Novel_Associations_Between_Major.12.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jpgn\/2016\/04000\/Novel_Associations_Between_Major.12.pdf","pmid":"26398154","pubdate":"2015-09-24T22:00:21+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"567","subjects":["pediatrics","gastroenterology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Novel Associations Between Major Histocompatibility Complex and Pediatric-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jpgn\/Fulltext\/2016\/04000\/Novel_Associations_Between_Major.12.aspx","volume":"62","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-associations-between-major-histocompatibility-complex-pediatriconset-inflammatory-bowel-diseas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150076,"mean":6.9043957460448,"rank":7054270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150076,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237476,"mean":9.4686798694599,"rank":197452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237476,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2707,"mean":3.7577923133777,"rank":2560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2707,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":2.4611764705882,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Ph.
