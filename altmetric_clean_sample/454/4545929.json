In the crystal, mol-ecules are linked via pairs of O-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds, involving the boronic acid OH groups, forming inversion dimers. The dimers are linked via O-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds, involving a boronic acid OH group and the carbonyl O atom, forming undulating sheets parallel to (10-2). Within the sheets there are also C-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds present, also involving the carbonyl O atom.
