Analyses of National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) data (N = 7,159) showed that, over the study period, alcohol use and heavy drinking declined while problematic drinking increased. In addition, living at home and parental relationship quality were associated with fewer concurrent and prospective alcohol behaviors whereas financial strain and parents' financial support were associated with more alcohol behaviors. The implications for minimizing alcohol misuse in young adults amid uncertain economic conditions are discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5f53cf058f610005e6d","authors":["Serido, Joyce","Lawry, Charles","Li, Gu","Conger, Katherine J","Russell, Stephen T"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10834-013-9376-x","first_seen_on":"2015-09-23T03:31:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1058-0476"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Family & Economic Issues","last_mentioned_on":1443020854,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26388681?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26388681","pubdate":"2014-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Economics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Personality and Social Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Policy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sociology, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Economics, Econometrics and Finance","Psychology"],"title":"The Associations of Financial Stress and Parenting Support Factors with Alcohol Behaviors During Young Adulthood.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/associations-financial-stress-parenting-support-factors-alcohol-behaviors-during-young-adulthood"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6392643,"mean":5.8550394828937,"rank":2348047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3949992,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6392643,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200762,"mean":9.8759205821848,"rank":77514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":119401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200762,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":5.5996222222222,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":43.1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
