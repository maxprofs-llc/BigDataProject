In the crystal, mol-ecules are linked by pairs of O-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds, forming classical acid-acid inversion dimers, with an R 2 (2)(8) ring motif. The dimers are linked by pairs of C-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds forming chains, enclosing R 2 (2)(16) ring motifs, propagating along the c-axis direction.","authors":["Venturini, C.","Venturini, C.","Ratel-Ramond, N.","Gourdon, A."],"doi":"10.1107\/s2056989015016515","first_seen_on":"2015-09-24T00:04:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2056-9890"],"issue":"Pt 10","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section E: Crystallographic Communications","last_mentioned_on":1443052818,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S2056989015016515"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/e\/issues\/2015\/10\/00\/su5200\/su5200.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4647427","pmid":"26594457","pubdate":"2015-09-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","title":"Crystal structure of 3-ethynyl\u00adbenzoic acid","type":"article","volume":"71"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ActaCrystE\/statuses\/646836520163348480","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4545935],"posted_on":"2015-09-24T00:00:18+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"ActaCrystE","tweeter_id":"587565184","geo":{"lt":53.1905,"ln":-2.89189,"country":"GB"}},"tweet_id":"646836520163348480"}]}}
