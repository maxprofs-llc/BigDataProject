Despite advances in materials synthesis and assembly processes, our ability to control hierarchical assembly using fibrillar biomolecules remains limited. Here, we developed a bio-inspired approach to create collagen-like materials through directed evolutionary screening and directed self-assembly. We first synthesized peptide amphiphiles by coupling phage display-identified collagen-like peptides to long-chain fatty acids. We then assembled the amphiphiles into diverse, hierarchically organized, nanofibrous structures using directed self-assembly based on liquid crystal flow and its controlled deposition. The resulting structures sustained and directed the growth of bone cells and hydroxyapatite biominerals. We believe these self-assembling collagen-like amphiphiles could prove useful in the structural design of tissue regenerating materials.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Jin, Hyo-Eon Eon","Jang, Jaein","Chung, Jinhyo","Lee, Hee Jung","Wang, Eddie E","Lee, Seung-Wuk","Chung, Woo-Jae"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.nanolett.5b03313","first_seen_on":"2015-09-24T10:14:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1530-6992"],"journal":"Nano Letters","last_mentioned_on":1472897773,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26392232?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.nanolett.5b03313?ref=tw&hootPostID=fb6e26bde4f541eb59a58980d7f879b9","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.nanolett.5b03313"],"pmid":"26392232","pubdate":"2015-09-24T22:02:35+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Biomimetic Self-Templated Hierarchical Structures of Collagen-Like Peptide Amphiphiles","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biomimetic-selftemplated-hierarchical-structures-collagenlike-peptide-amphiphiles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":3607205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4594231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238584,"mean":9.499926658647,"rank":89364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":144721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238584,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4313,"mean":12.473506029685,"rank":2457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1786,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4313,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":18.172585365854,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
