The aim of this study was to evaluate current cleaning and disinfection procedures of endoscope channels with high bioburden and biofilm analysis, including the use of resistant mycobacteria associated with postsurgical infections in Brazil.\nTwenty-seven original endoscope channels were contaminated with organic soil containing 10(8) CFU\/mL of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, or Mycobacterium abscessus subsp. bolletii. Biofilms with the same microorganisms were developed on the inner surface of channels with the initial inoculum of 10(5) CFU\/mL. Channels were reprocessed following current protocol and samples from cleaning and disinfection steps were analyzed by bioluminescence for ATP, cultures for viable microorganisms, and confocal microscopy.\nAfter contamination, ATP levels increased dramatically, and high bacterial growth was observed in all cultures. After cleaning ATP levels decreased to values comparable to the pre-contamination levels, and bacterial growth was demonstrated in 5 of 27 catheters, being 2 with P. aeruginosa and 3 with M. abscessus. In regard to induced biofilm, a remarkable reduction occurred after cleaning, but significant microbial growth inhibition occurred only after disinfection. Nevertheless, viable microorganisms within the biofilm were still detected by confocal microscopy, more so with glutaraldehyde than with peraceitc acid or o-phataladehyde.\nAfter the complete disinfection procedure, viable microorganisms could still be detected within the biofilm on channels' endoscope. Prevention of biofilm development within endoscope channels should be a priority in disinfection procedures, particularly for ERCP and EUS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058f7","authors":["Neves, Marcelo S","da Silva, Marlei Gomes","Ventura, Grasiella M","C\u00f4rtes, Patr\u00edcia Barbur","Duarte, Rafael Silva","de Souza, Heitor S","Marcelo S.
