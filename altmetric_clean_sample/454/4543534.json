Contact (tc) and aerial (ta) times, step frequency (f) and running velocity (v) were measured at 3,14,30 km and after the finish line (POST). Peak vertical ground reaction force (Fmax), vertical displacement of the centre of mass (\u0394z), leg length change (\u0394L), vertical (kvert) and leg (kleg) stiffness were calculated.\nMMP was inversely related with race time (r:-0.56,p:0.016), tc (r:-0.61,p:0.008), \u0394z (r:-0.57,p:0.012) and directly related with Fmax (r:0.59,p:0.010), ta (r:0.48,p:0.040), kvert (r:0.51,p:0.027). In the fastest sub-group (n:9) the following parameters were lower in POST (p<0.05) than at km 3: ta (-14.1\u00b117.8%), Fmax (-6.2\u00b16.4%), kvert (-17.5\u00b117.2%), kleg (-11.4\u00b110.9%). The slowest sub-group (n:9) showed changes (p<0.05) at km 30 and POST in Fmax (-5.5\u00b14.9% and -5.3\u00b14.1%), ta (-20.5\u00b116.2% and -21.5\u00b114.4%), tc (+5.5\u00b17.5% and +3.2\u00b15.2%), kvert (-14.0\u00b112.8% and -11.8\u00b110.0%), kleg (-8.9\u00b111.5 and -11.9\u00b112%). TMG temporal-parameters decreased in all runners (-27.35\u00b118.0%,p<0.001), while Dm increased (+24.0\u00b135.0%,p:0.005), showing lower muscle stiffness and higher muscle sensibility to the electrical stimulus.\nGreater MMP was related with smaller changes in running biomechanics induced by fatigue. Thus, lower limb power training could improve running performance in uphill-marathons.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079e4","authors":["Giovanelli, Nicola","Taboga, Paolo","Rejc, Enrico","Simunic, Bostjan","Antonutto, Guglielmo","Lazzer, Stefano"],"doi":"10.1123\/ijspp.2014-0602","first_seen_on":"2015-09-23T07:12:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1555-0273"],"journal":"International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance","last_mentioned_on":1448266765,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26390075"],"pmid":"26390075","pubdate":"2015-09-23T22:00:12+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["physiology","sportsmedicine"],"title":"Effects of an Uphill Marathon on Running Mechanics and Lower Limb Muscles Fatigue.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-uphill-marathon-running-mechanics-lowerlimb-muscle-fatigue"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6597995,"mean":6.1232477659116,"rank":881334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":5714662,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6597995,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204595,"mean":9.9898331524875,"rank":39652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":164818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204595,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":724,"mean":10.271266943292,"rank":253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":470,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":724,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":13.2425,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
