We report an asymptomatic 62-year-old woman with complete agenesis of the dorsal pancreas. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a normal pancreatic head, but pancreatic body and tail were not visualized. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were similar to CT. At magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), the major pancreatic duct was short and the dorsal pancreatic duct was not visualized. The final diagnosis was dorsal pancreatic agenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d0f","authors":["Lale Pasaoglu","Murat Vural","Hatice Gul Hatipoglu","Gokce Tereklioglu","Suha Koparal"],"doi":"10.3748\/wjg.14.2915","first_seen_on":"2015-09-24T14:58:58+00:00","issns":["1007-9327"],"issue":"18","journal":"World Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1443106723,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2710738\/"],"pmcid":"PMC2710738","pmid":"18473421","pubdate":"2008-05-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Baishideng Publishing Group Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2915","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Agenesis of the dorsal pancreas","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/agenesis-dorsal-pancreas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6395452,"mean":5.855557062669,"rank":3014107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1916993,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6395452,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200750,"mean":9.8860781672636,"rank":108072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":72374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200750,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3079,"mean":2.3148973359324,"rank":1131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3079,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":1.281746031746,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
