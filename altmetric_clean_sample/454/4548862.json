Read here: and here","@salinaro17 $FGEN nice read of what else this can go","$FGEN something to thing about upon IPF data.","Carlo Vancheri discusses the similarities between #IPF and #cancer"],"citation":{"abstract":"The aim of this opinion article is to understand to what extent idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) can be considered, in its clinical and pathogenic features, similar to cancer. Indeed, IPF has common risk factors with cancer, a low survival, and, most importantly, epigenetic and genetic alterations, abnormal expression of microRNAs, cellular and molecular aberrances, and the activation of similar signalling pathways.\nThe pathogenic link between the two diseases may have a number of practical consequences. It may improve our understanding of IPF drawing on cancer biology knowledge. In addition, the recognition of similar pathogenic pathways may also encourage the use of cancer drugs for the treatment of IPF. Nintedanib, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase receptors initially developed for cancer, has been recently approved for the treatment of IPF thanks to the observation that these receptors are also abnormally activated in IPF. The vision of IPF as a cancer-like disease may improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease also opening new scenarios for repositioning cancer drugs for IPF. In addition, it may increase the level of awareness towards this dreadful disease at the public, political, and healthcare level.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007c7","authors":["Carlo Vancheri"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12916-015-0478-1","first_seen_on":"2015-09-24T13:29:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1741-7015"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1504282430,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7015\/13\/220","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26399408?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26399408?dopt=Abstract&__scoop_post=7b249bc0-6431-11e5-ab64-001018304b75&__scoop_topic=332196&utm_content=buffer07d7f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26399408?dopt=Abstract&__scoop_post=7b249bc0-6431-11e5-ab64-001018304b75&__scoop_topic=332196&utm_content=bufferdd228&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12916-015-0478-1","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26399408\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26399408\/?_scpsug=crawled_157970_378ffe40-8ec3-11e7-f73a-f01fafd7b417&utm_content=buffer50e2b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer#_scpsug=crawled_157970_378ffe40-8ec3-11e7-f73a-f01fafd7b417","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26399408\/?_scpsug=crawled_157970_378ffe40-8ec3-11e7-f73a-f01fafd7b417&utm_content=buffer0aff2&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer#_scpsug=crawled_157970_378ffe40-8ec3-11e7-f73a-f01fafd7b417"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12916-015-0478-1.pdf","pmid":"26399408","pubdate":"2015-09-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"220","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cancer: do they really look similar?","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-cancer-really-look-similar"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.68,"score_history":{"1y":4.1,"6m":4.1,"3m":3.1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.68},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":646911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7810271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239187,"mean":9.5225896917043,"rank":25758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":213426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239187,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1651,"mean":31.331738181818,"rank":675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":976,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1651,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":56.075936170213,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
