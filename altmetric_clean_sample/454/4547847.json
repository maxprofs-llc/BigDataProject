It occurs universally and is usually responsive to first line antibiotics. However, resistance to first line antibiotics and even second line antibiotics is becoming more wide spread. We report a case of puerperal infection caused by carbapenem resistant organisms leading to prolonged fever and hospitalisation. A 28-year-old primigravida, following caesarean section done elsewhere, for elevated blood pressure presented with high grade fever. The patient was treated with antibiotic to which she failed to respond. She underwent laparotomy twice and only improved after Colistin was combined with Meropenam, based on urine and pus culture reports.","authors":["Londhe, Vaibhav","Vijayaselvi, Reeta","Balaji, V","Benjamin, Santosh J","Sahni, Rani Diana"],"doi":"10.7860\/jcdr\/2015\/13577.6148","first_seen_on":"2015-09-24T10:17:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2249-782X"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR","last_mentioned_on":1444127884,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26393170?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26393170","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Carbapenem Resistant Organisms: An Unusual Aetiology for Puerperal Sepsis.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carbapenem-resistant-organisms-unusual-aetiology-puerperal-sepsis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Immunology and Microbiology":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AntibioticResis\/statuses\/646991623272816640","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4547847],"posted_on":"2015-09-24T10:16:38+00:00","author":{"name":"AntibioticResistance","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/551766191962746880\/GlO2QteM_normal.jpeg","description":"Keep abreast of the latest developments in the fight against Antibiotic Resistance #AMR with the latest publications curated from PubMed.
