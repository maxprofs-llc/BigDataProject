According to the mass spectra of Ru-SG (product of Ru-dpq reacted with GSH), and single crystal structure of the final oxidized product Ru-dcbpy ((Ru(bpy)2dcbpy(2+), dcbpy=3,3-dicarboxy-2,2-bipyridine), we propose a new interacted mechanism between Ru-dpq and GSH. A good linear relation is estimated to be from 0.1pM to 50\u03bcM in the presence of calcium ion and the detection limit is as low as 0.087pM (with the signal-to-noise ratio of 3). The relative standard deviation is 2.3% (for three repeated measurements). Furthermore, the ECL signal of Ru-dpq under a constant potential (1.2V) is extremely stable and the intensity could be maintained over 600s, which promotes us to determine the concentration of GSH via chronoamperometry.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f7","authors":["Xu, Yanxue","Zhang, Lei","Liu, Yuan","Jin, Zhaoyu","Zhao, Qian","Yang, Feng","Xiao, Dan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bios.2015.09.033","first_seen_on":"2015-09-24T15:34:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09565663","1873-4235"],"journal":"Biosensors & Bioelectronics","last_mentioned_on":1443108870,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0956566315304292&_version=1&md5=96b806a6b423ff7e8879d04c70a01ba0"],"pmid":"26406459","pubdate":"2015-09-26T22:00:26+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Sensitive and selective determination of GSH based on the ECL quenching of Ru(II) 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione complex ","type":"article","volume":"77","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sensitive-selective-determination-gsh-based-ecl-quenching-ruii-110phenanthroline56dione-complex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6395994,"mean":5.8563900842303,"rank":4725591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":947139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6395994,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200757,"mean":9.8858383111839,"rank":137976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":40554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200757,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1742,"mean":2.4666088454911,"rank":973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":489,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1742,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":3.7942352941176,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
