In this review, the role of miRNAs and lncRNAs in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication will be discussed. The review focuses on miRNAs that target cellular proteins involved in HIV replication-proteins that mediate steps in the viral life cycle, as well as proteins of the innate immune system that inhibit HIV replication. Given the large number of miRNAs encoded in the human genome, as well as the large number of cellular proteins involved in HIV replication, the number of miRNAs identified to date that affect viral replication are certainly only the 'tip of the iceberg'. The review also discusses two lncRNAs that are involved in HIV gene regulation-7SK RNA and NEAT1 RNA. 7SK RNA is involved in HIV Tat protein stimulation of RNA polymerase II elongation of the integrated provirus, while NEAT1 RNA is involved in HIV Rev protein export of incompletely spliced viral transcripts.
