This study investigated the extent of general practitioner involvement in a community mental health centre and examined whether the presence of a documented general practitioner in the patient's medical records was associated with markers of better health outcomes.\nThe medical records of current patients were audited, including those receiving medical care and case management and those only receiving medical care. The demographic and diagnostic information, evidence of metabolic screening, blood test results, and medications of patients with a recorded general practitioner were compared with those of patients with no recorded general practitioner.\nNinety-eight of 191 (51%) of patients had details of a general practitioner documented in their medical records. There were no significant differences in rates of metabolic screening between the two groups. Those with a general practitioner had more medical diagnoses and were taking a greater number of psychiatric medications.\nAlthough the medical comorbidities of serious mental illness are becoming increasingly recognised, our findings suggest the need for ongoing and coordinated efforts by policymakers, general practitioners, mental health services and patients to ensure the health and longevity of people with serious mental illness.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51d3cf058f610003973","authors":["Jae Jang","Shuli Futeran","Matthew Large","Jackie Curtis","Jang, Jae","Futeran, Shuli","Large, Matthew","Curtis, Jackie"],"doi":"10.1177\/1039856215592479","endpage":"574","first_seen_on":"2015-09-24T07:57:13+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1440-1665","1039-8562"],"issue":"5","journal":"Australasian Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1443081417,"links":["http:\/\/apy.sagepub.com\/content\/23\/5\/571.abstract?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/apy.sagepub.com\/content\/23\/5\/571.full.pdf","pmid":"26139704","pubdate":"2015-07-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"571","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"An audit of general practitioner involvement in public community mental health care","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/audit-general-practitioner-involvement-public-community-mental-health-care"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6395994,"mean":5.8563900842303,"rank":4725594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":947135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6395994,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200758,"mean":9.8857898155483,"rank":137976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":40553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200758,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":805,"mean":2.2699925373134,"rank":286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":805,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":4.743,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
