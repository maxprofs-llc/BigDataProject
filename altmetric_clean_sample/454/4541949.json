Originally designed and piloted in a small number of hospitals, TCAB is being disseminated through large-scale quality improvement (QI) collaboratives facilitated by professional organizations, such the New Jersey Hospital Association's Institute for Quality and Patient Safety (NJHA). This article presents the results of an evaluation of the NJHA dissemination effort. The evaluation team used an observational mixed-method evaluation design and multiple data sources to assess implementation of TCAB by nursing units in these facilities. The results show that most of the participating units successfully implemented the TCAB improvement processes. Nursing teamwork and three nursing-sensitive outcomes improved significantly over the course of TCAB, and TCAB unit managers attributed important improvements to their unit's participation. These findings suggest that TCAB is a viable mechanism for engaging frontline nursing staff in valuable QI activities. Other hospitals interested in furthering the culture and capacity for QI among frontline nursing unit staff should consider a TCAB collaborative for achieving these goals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059e4","authors":["Pearson, Marjorie L","Needleman, Jack","Beckman, Robin","Han, Bing"],"doi":"10.1097\/jhq.0000000000000007","first_seen_on":"2015-09-22T18:51:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1945-1474"],"journal":"Journal for Healthcare Quality: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare","last_mentioned_on":1442948422,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26359846"],"pmid":"26359846","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"Facilitating Nurses' Engagement in Hospital Quality Improvement: The New Jersey Hospital Association's Implementation of Transforming Care at the Bedside.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/facilitating-nurses-engagement-hospital-quality-improvement"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6387250,"mean":5.8558623845718,"rank":2758874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3573988,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6387250,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200607,"mean":9.8822757345243,"rank":96089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":102458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200607,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193,"mean":5.5978645833333,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
