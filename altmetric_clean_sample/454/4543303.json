We sought to determine whether GLUL rs10911021 is associated prospectively with adjudicated cardiovascular composite endpoints among overweight\/obese individuals with T2D and whether a lifestyle intervention resulting in weight loss could diminish this association. Look AHEAD is a randomized, controlled trial to determine the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI), including weight loss and physical activity, relative to Diabetes Support and Education (DSE), on cardiovascular outcomes. Look AHEAD participants included in this report were 3,845 overweight\/obese individuals with T2D who provided consent for genetic analyses. Over a median of 9.6 year follow-up, the risk (C) allele for GLUL rs10911021 was significantly associated with the primary composite endpoint of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for angina among individuals with no history of CVD at baseline using additive genetic models (HR, 95% CI: 1.17 (1.01-1.36) p=0.032). Results appeared more consistent in recessive models and among individuals with no known history of CVD at baseline; ILI did not alter these associations. These results extend the association of GLUL rs10911021 to incident CVD morbidity and mortality in the setting of T2D.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f7","authors":["The Look AHEAD Research Group*","The Look AHEAD Research Group"],"doi":"10.2337\/db15-0890","first_seen_on":"2015-09-23T04:01:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1939-327X","0012-1797"],"journal":"Diabetes","last_mentioned_on":1450827050,"links":["http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/09\/17\/db15-0890.short?rss=1","http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/09\/17\/db15-0890.short?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/65\/1\/297.short?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/65\/1\/297.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/09\/17\/db15-0890.full.pdf","pmid":"26395743","pubdate":"2015-09-24T22:01:18+00:00","publisher":"American Diabetes Association","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Prospective Association of GLUL rs10911021 With Cardiovascular Morbidity and Mortality Among Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes: The Look AHEAD Study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prospective-association-glul-rs10911021-cardiovascular-morbidity-mortality-among-individuals-type-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6810016,"mean":6.1874355128406,"rank":1423266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5375582,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6810016,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230804,"mean":9.1398600104851,"rank":58706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":171564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230804,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3494,"mean":7.1563338104781,"rank":1010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":2462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3494,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":8.3033833333333,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
