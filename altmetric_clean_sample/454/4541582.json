This progression has enhanced the level of dietary support to manage athletes' nutrition in a holistic perspective. Athletes are now educated about food fundamentals (acquiring foods, menu planning, preparing, food safety), personal accountability of hydration and energy monitoring (urinary and body weight assessments), individualized supplementation protocols, and customized nutrition for variable daily training environments according to their Yearly Training Plan. Sport dietitians are an important member of Integrated Sport Teams where collaboration exists amongst professionals who coordinate the athletes' personalized training and performance programming. Dietitians in sport are encouraged to continue to lobby for nutrition programming at the elite, varsity, provincial, and club levels to ensure that athletes receive accurate guidance from nutrition experts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000d91","authors":[" Kelly Anne Erdman MSc, RD, CSSD "],"doi":"10.3148\/cjdpr-2015-021","first_seen_on":"2015-09-22T16:45:59+00:00","issns":["1486-3847"],"issue":"3","journal":"Canadian Journal of Dietetic Practice and Research","last_mentioned_on":1442940332,"links":["http:\/\/dcjournal.ca.www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3148\/cjdpr-2015-021?af=R"],"pmid":"26280796","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"A Lifetime Pursuit of a Sports Nutrition Practice","type":"article","volume":"76","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lifetime-pursuit-sports-nutrition-practice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6386702,"mean":5.8553449560254,"rank":3010702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1913635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6386702,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200601,"mean":9.8822535194415,"rank":108087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":72188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200601,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127,"mean":2.9089841269841,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":5.505,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Lecturer":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Social Sciences":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/gordspolysacch\/statuses\/646364718349717504","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4541582],"posted_on":"2015-09-22T16:45:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Gord","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_0_normal.png","id_on_source":"gordspolysacch","tweeter_id":"3278422434","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":0},"tweet_id":"646364718349717504"}]}}
