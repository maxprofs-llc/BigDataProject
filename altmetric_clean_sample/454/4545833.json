The theorem applies to a broad class of quantum dynamics, such as unitary evolution, decoherence, thermalization, and other types of evolution for quantum open systems. The theorem reproduces well-known fluctuation theorems in a single and simplified framework and extends the Hatano-Sasa theorem to quantum nonequilibrium processes. Moreover, it helps to elucidate the physical nature of the environment that induces a given dynamics in an open quantum system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008518","authors":["Manzano, Gonzalo","Horowitz, Jordan M","Parrondo, Juan M R"],"doi":"10.1103\/physreve.92.032129","first_seen_on":"2015-09-23T23:01:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1550-2376"],"issue":"3","journal":"Physical Review E: Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics","last_mentioned_on":1443049296,"links":["http:\/\/journals.aps.org\/pre\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevE.92.032129"],"pmid":"26465448","pubdate":"2015-10-16T22:02:05+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Mathematics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biophysics","physiology","statisticsastopic"],"title":"Nonequilibrium potential and fluctuation theorems for quantum maps","type":"article","volume":"92","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonequilibrium-potential-fluctuation-theorems-quantum-maps"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7387729,"mean":6.4191974073719,"rank":6393477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7387729,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232998,"mean":9.2449265612862,"rank":193211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232998,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5212,"mean":2.0540644789868,"rank":4024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5212,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":8.4702272727273,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
