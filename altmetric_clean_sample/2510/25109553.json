Penthrane was administered intermittently with the Penthrane oxilator (Rod inhalator of Abbott). The initial concentration was 0.25 volume%. The maximal concentration was 0.35 volume% of Penthrane. Fetal monitoring records were obtained in all deliveries. In 49 cases (46.7%) intra- and post-partum microblood studies were obtained. In 85 women (81.0%) the result of the analgesia was good. Nausea occurred in 21 women (20%). There were no abnormal fetal monitoring patterns. The Apgar scores of the newborns were between 8 and 10. The actual pH's were between 7.24 and 7.41. The third stage of labour was normal in all cases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000714d","authors":["Leeds, Ira L.","Alimi, Yewande","Hobson, Deborah R.","Efron, Jonathan E.","Wick, Elizabeth C.","Haut, Elliott R.","Johnston, Fabian M.","Ira L.
