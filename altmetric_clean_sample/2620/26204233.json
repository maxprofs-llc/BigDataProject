Methods Forty-six adolescents referred to an ED Program were recruited for inclusion in this study. A detailed 24-h dietary recall from each participant was obtained and a detailed nutritional analysis was generated, allowing for calculation of the HEI-2010. Descriptive statistics were calculated to determine baseline characteristics of the study population and to determine associations and differences between ED subtypes. Results Average daily caloric intake was below recommended values in the study population. Despite this, the distribution of macronutrients was within the ranges recommended for older children and adolescents by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010. Micronutrient content varied considerably. The study population had a mean HEI-2010 score of 60.1, falling within the \"needs improvement\" category. A majority of the participants had insufficient caloric intake for the HEI to be applicable. Conclusion Results suggest that adolescents with EDs have a surprisingly normal distribution of macronutrient intake. Although using a diet quality assessment tool such as the HEI-2010 has been helpful in analyzing overall diet quality in the general population, the restrictive caloric intake which characterizes the ED population prevents the utility of such a guide for most patients with EDs.","authors":["Alexis Santiago","Jacqueline Zimmerman","Ronald Feinstein","Martin Fisher"],"doi":"10.1515\/ijamh-2017-0033","first_seen_on":"2017-09-18T17:02:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2191-0278"],"journal":"International Journal of Adolescent Medicine and Health","last_mentioned_on":1506052800,"links":["https:\/\/www.degruyter.com\/view\/j\/ijamh.ahead-of-print\/ijamh-2017-0033\/ijamh-2017-0033.xml?utm_content=buffer00778&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.degruyter.com\/view\/j\/ijamh.ahead-of-print\/ijamh-2017-0033\/www.degruyter.com\/view\/j\/ijamh.ahead-of-print\/ijamh-2017-0033\/ijamh-2017-0033.xml","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=Zimmerman%20J"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.degruyter.com\/downloadpdf\/j\/ijamh.ahead-of-print\/ijamh-2017-0033\/ijamh-2017-0033.xml","pmid":"28915110","pubdate":"2017-09-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"De Gruyter","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Diet quality of adolescents with eating disorders","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.83,"score_history":{"1y":8.83,"6m":8.83,"3m":8.83,"1m":8.83,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.83},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aedweb\/statuses\/909824760560914432","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26204233],"posted_on":"2017-09-18T17:01:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Academy for E.D.","url":"http:\/\/www.aedweb.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/461973850624778240\/8nmMhLTK_normal.jpeg","description":"The Academy for Eating Disorders: A global, professional association committed to leadership in eating disorders research, education, treatment and prevention.","id_on_source":"aedweb","tweeter_id":"21700435","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":10294},"tweet_id":"909824760560914432"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/GLLuxardi\/statuses\/909856496627920896","license":"gnip","rt":["aedweb"],"citation_ids":[26204233],"posted_on":"2017-09-18T19:07:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Gian Luigi Luxardi","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2928203160\/306b20da1bc2d0c1a36dd6e979485b26_normal.jpeg","description":"psicologo-psicoterapeuta\r\nresponsabile Centro per i Disturbi Alimentari di San Vito al Tagliamento (PN)\r\nPresidente Eletto della sezione Triveneta della SISDCA","id_on_source":"GLLuxardi","tweeter_id":"984671624","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":113},"tweet_id":"909856496627920896"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JoannaPoppink\/statuses\/910002428405104641","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26204233],"posted_on":"2017-09-19T04:47:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Joanna Poppink, MFT","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JoannaPoppink","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000763943239\/1ada1c7d6ce51320fb6612bf66e869d1_normal.jpeg","description":"Los Angeles eating disorder recovery psychotherapist and global sustainability advocate sharing mental health and environmental news you might not otherwise see","id_on_source":"JoannaPoppink","tweeter_id":"14375658","geo":{"lt":34.05223,"ln":-118.24368,"country":"US"},"followers":5030},"tweet_id":"910002428405104641"}],"blogs":[{"title":"Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)","url":"http:\/\/www.umem.org\/educational_pearls\/3315\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[6042856,3310808,21088687,26456896,21609710,26340409,26456898,26204233,24622281,23210464,24482345,22575734,21524434,20860103,23971508,26456896,23815783,24157824,26456898,26456900,21024889,26415455,3310808,18648960,24658511,24281893],"posted_on":"2017-09-22T04:00:00+00:00","summary":"Since the first description of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), various consensus conferences (including American-European Consensus Co...
