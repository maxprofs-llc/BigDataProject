Even though there is some knowledge regarding sex differences in the lung disease, little is known about extrapulmonary manifestations. Our aim was to analyze the specific profile of muscle dysfunction, structure, and biology in COPD women. Twenty-one women and 19 men with stable COPD as well as 15 controls were included. Nutritional status, physical activity, lung and muscle function, exercise capacity, and quality of life were assessed. In addition, blood, breath condensate, and quadriceps muscle samples were tested for inflammatory markers. Moreover, fiber phenotype, signs of damage-regeneration, and the expression of key genes linked to myogenesis and inflammation were assessed in the muscle. Inflammatory markers were increased in all body compartments but no correlation was found among them. Muscle dysfunction was present in both COPD groups but was more marked in women. The opposite occurred with the increase in the percentage of type II fibers that was lower in women despite a similar level of airway obstruction as in men. Female COPD also showed higher signs of muscle damage than COPD men who, in contrast, exhibited slightly higher signs of regeneration. We conclude that sex influences muscle phenotype and function in COPD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006eae","authors":["Aus\u00edn, Pilar","Mart\u00ednez-Llorens, Juana","Sabat\u00e9-Bresco, Marina","Casadevall, Carme","Barreiro, Esther","Gea, Joaquim"],"doi":"10.1177\/1479972316674412","first_seen_on":"2016-12-08T19:39:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1479-9731","1479-9723"],"journal":"Chronic Respiratory Disease","last_mentioned_on":1481544358,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27923983\/?i=10&from=copd","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27923983\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27923983"],"pmid":"27923983","pubdate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Sex differences in function and structure of the quadriceps muscle in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sex-differences-function-structure-quadriceps-muscle-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-patients-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.9,"score_history":{"1y":6.9,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7879571,"mean":6.6725285125901,"rank":1167260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6709792,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7879571,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252492,"mean":12.267140064398,"rank":56122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":196189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252492,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209,"mean":5.9505192307692,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":7.106,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":3,"US":1,"IN":1,"AU":1,"IE":1,"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RehabSJJ\/statuses\/806938835686985728","license":"gnip","rt":["pulmonary_rehab"],"citation_ids":[14573860],"posted_on":"2016-12-08T19:09:45+00:00","author":{"name":"Steven Jackson","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/908570969979084804\/wtQRiVWS_normal.jpg","description":"LPT Respiratory Physiotherapist covering Melton, Oakham & Loughborough Heart Failure \/ Pulmonary Rehabilitation.","id_on_source":"RehabSJJ","tweeter_id":"1029010148","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":1087},"tweet_id":"806938835686985728"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ken_kenc\/statuses\/806939037646856192","license":"gnip","rt":["pulmonary_rehab"],"citation_ids":[14573860],"posted_on":"2016-12-08T19:10:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Ken Clasper","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/700963607421460480\/G04k0Txn_normal.png","description":"Sunderland AFC supporter, who also writes a blog on Living  with Lewy Body Dementia\/Parkinsons and Bilateral Bronchiectasis\/Emphysema","id_on_source":"ken_kenc","tweeter_id":"403296588","geo":{"lt":35.99403,"ln":-78.89862,"country":"US"},"followers":4130},"tweet_id":"806939037646856192"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrNANDAGOPAL\/statuses\/806942684468252672","license":"gnip","rt":["pulmonary_rehab"],"citation_ids":[14573860],"posted_on":"2016-12-08T19:25:02+00:00","author":{"name":"NANDAGOPAL V","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3615431514\/5465f851cd0849e75691463ac8146f30_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"DrNANDAGOPAL","tweeter_id":"1245760322","geo":{"lt":11,"ln":78,"country":"IN"},"followers":248},"tweet_id":"806942684468252672"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/malenchip\/statuses\/806960150359801856","license":"gnip","rt":["pulmonary_rehab"],"citation_ids":[14573860],"posted_on":"2016-12-08T20:34:27+00:00","author":{"name":"Mal North","url":"http:\/\/www.mymhealth.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000077947050\/cefa6e07eaaf7fab6a1c02df47652cd1_normal.jpeg","description":"#respiratory nurse specialist #wessex CLAHRC research fellow, with a keen interest in COPD and Asthma self management .
