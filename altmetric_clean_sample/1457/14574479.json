During the course of peptide-wise analysis of shotgun proteomic datasets representative of colon adenocarcinoma (AC) and ulcerative colitis (UC), we detected a cancer-specific proteolytic fingerprint composed of a set of numerous protein fragments cleaved C-terminally to V, I, A, T, or C residues, significantly overrepresented in AC. A peptide set linked by a common VIATC cleavage consensus was the only prominent cancer-specific proteolytic fingerprint detected. This sequence consensus indicated neutrophil elastase as a source of the fingerprint. We also found that a large fraction of affected proteins are RNA processing proteins associated with the nuclear fraction and mostly cleaved within their functionally important RNA-binding domains. Thus, we detected a new class of cancer-specific peptides that are possible markers of tumor-infiltrating neutrophil activity, which often correlates with the clinical outcome. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers: PXD005274 (Dataset 1) and PXD004249 (Dataset 2). Our results indicate the value of peptide-wise analysis of large global proteomic analysis datasets as opposed to protein-wise analysis, in which outlier differential peptides are usually neglected.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081d9","authors":["Michal Kistowski","Janusz D\u0119bski","Jakub Karczmarski","Agnieszka Paziewska","Jacek Ol\u0119dzki","Micha\u0142 Mikula","Jerzy Ostrowski","Micha\u0142 Dadlez"],"doi":"10.1074\/mcp.m116.058818","first_seen_on":"2016-12-08T19:51:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1535-9484"],"journal":"Molecular and Cellular Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1481224758,"links":["http:\/\/www.mcponline.org\/content\/early\/2016\/12\/07\/mcp.M116.058818.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mcponline.org\/content\/early\/2016\/12\/07\/mcp.M116.058818.full.pdf","pmid":"27927741","pubdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"mcp.M116.058818","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"A strong neutrophil elastase proteolytic fingerprint marks the carcinoma tumor proteome","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/strong-neutrophil-elastase-proteolytic-fingerprint-marks-carcinoma-tumor-proteome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7915726,"mean":6.6963151872954,"rank":6002395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1062530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7915726,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254630,"mean":12.254184597983,"rank":177700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":47488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254630,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1556,"mean":3.6376617363344,"rank":1183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1556,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":9.9450212765957,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
