In spite of several advances in analytical and computational tools, obtaining a sufficient number of samples from patients remains an obstacle. The dried blood spot (DBS) and dried urine strip (DUS) methodologies are a minimally invasive sample collection method allowing for the relative simplicity of sample collection and minimal cost. (2) Methods: In the current report, we compared results of targeted metabolomics analyses of four types of human blood sample collection methods (with and without DBS) and two types of urine sample collection (DUS and urine) across several parameters including the metabolite coverage of each matrix and the sample stability for DBS\/DUS using commercially available Whatman 903TM paper. The DBS\/DUS metabolomics protocols were further applied to examine the temporal metabolite level fluctuations within hours and days of sample collection. (3) Results: Several hundred polar metabolites were monitored using DBS\/DUS. Temporal analysis of the polar metabolites at various times of the day and across days identified several species that fluctuate as a function of day and time. In addition, a subset of metabolites were identified to be significantly altered across hours within a day and within successive days of the week. (4) Conclusion: A comprehensive DBS\/DUS metabolomics protocol was developed for human blood and urine analyses. The described methodology demonstrates the potential for enabling patients to contribute to the expanding bioanalytical demands of precision medicine and population health studies.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef742a83ee09648b51a1","authors":["Jeremy Drolet","Vladimir Tolstikov","Brian Williams","Bennett Greenwood","Collin Hill","Vivek Vishnudas","Rangaprasad Sarangarajan","Niven Narain","Michael Kiebish"],"doi":"10.3390\/metabo7030035","first_seen_on":"2017-07-20T08:25:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2218-1989"],"issue":"3","journal":"Metabolites","last_mentioned_on":1502865949,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2218-1989\/7\/3\/35?utm_content=buffercbefb&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/metabo7030035"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2218-1989\/7\/3\/35\/pdf","pmid":"28714878","pubdate":"2017-07-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Integrated Metabolomics Assessment of Human Dried Blood Spots and Urine Strips","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/integrated-metabolomics-assessment-human-dried-blood-spots-urine-strips"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":1.35,"6m":1.35,"3m":1.35,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":4167188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4154777,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":216391,"mean":12.954557031286,"rank":107476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":106703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":216391,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182,"mean":3.0794696132597,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.4,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Thomas_Wilckens\/statuses\/887950899171164160","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22214224],"posted_on":"2017-07-20T08:22:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr. Thomas Wilckens","url":"http:\/\/www.InnVentis.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/460310079577669633\/1H8zg1xs_normal.jpeg","description":"MD, #PRECISIONMEDICINE leader: Changing the way we diagnose, treat  and eventually prevent disease.  #BigDATA and #MachineLearning applied to #omics","id_on_source":"Thomas_Wilckens","tweeter_id":"2149170848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1820},"tweet_id":"887950899171164160"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MetabolitesMDPI\/statuses\/897639143802642432","license":"gnip","rt":["Thomas_Wilckens"],"citation_ids":[22214224],"posted_on":"2017-08-16T02:00:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Metabolites_MDPI","url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/journal\/metabolites","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/735307944632279040\/LS-6OhPX_normal.jpg","description":"Metabolites (ISSN 2218-1989) is an open access journal of #metabolism and #metabolomics.
