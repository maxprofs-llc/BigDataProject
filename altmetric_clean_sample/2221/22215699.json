Paenibacillus sp. SSG-1 has previously been reported, and its agar-degradation trait has attracted our attention. Here, the genome sequence of Paenibacillus sp. SSG-1, together with 76 previously sequenced strains, was comparatively studied. The results show that the pan-genome of Paenibacillus is open and indicate that the current taxonomy of this genus is incorrect. The incessant flux of gene repertoires resulting from the processes of gain and loss largely contributed to the difference in genomic content and genome size in Paenibacillus. Furthermore, a large number of genes gained are associated with carbohydrate transport and metabolism. It indicates that the evolution of glycometabolism is a key factor for the environmental adaptability of Paenibacillus species. Interestingly, through horizontal gene transfer, Paenibacillus sp. SSG-1 acquired an approximately 150\u2009kb DNA fragment and shows an agar-degrading characteristic distinct from most other non-marine bacteria. This region may be transported in bacteria as a complete unit responsible for agar degradation. Taken together, these results provide insights into the evolutionary pattern of Paenibacillus and have implications for studies on the taxonomy and functional genomics of this genus.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Xu, Hui","Qin, Shishang","Lan, Yanhong","Liu, Mengjia","Cao, Xiyue","Qiao, Dairong","Cao, Yu","Cao, Yi","Hui Xu","Shishang Qin","Yanhong Lan","Mengjia Liu","Xiyue Cao","Dairong Qiao","Yu Cao","Yi Cao"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-06160-9","first_seen_on":"2017-07-20T10:02:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1500553924,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28720902?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28720902?dopt=Abstractu0026utm_source=dlvr.itu0026utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28720902","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","subjects":["science"],"title":"Comparative genomic analysis of Paenibacillus sp.
