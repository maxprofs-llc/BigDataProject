Patients were stratified according to number of involved nodes and type of primary surgery and randomized to receive the following: (1) tamoxifen 10 mg twice daily by mouth for 1 year; (2) cyclophosphamide 60 mg\/m2\/d by mouth for 1 year, methotrexate 15 mg\/m2 intravenously (IV) weekly for 1 year, fluorouracil (5-FU) 400 mg\/m2 IV weekly for 1 year, vincristine .625 mg\/m2 IV weekly for the first 10 weeks, and prednisone during weeks 1 to 10 with doses decreasing from 30 mg\/m2 to 2.5 mg\/m2 (CMFVP); or (3) the combination of tamoxifen and CMFVP.\nThe median follow-up duration is 6.5 years, with a maximum of 12.8 years. Treatment arms are not significantly different with respect to either survival or DFS (log-rank, 2 df, P = .82 and .23, respectively). The 5-year survival rate is 77% for the tamoxifen arm, 78% for CMFVP, and 75% for the combination. No significant differences were observed in node or receptor level subsets. Severe or worse toxicity was experienced by 56% of patients on CMFVP and 61% on CMFVP plus tamoxifen, compared with 5% on tamoxifen alone.\nCMFVP chemotherapy, either alone or in combination with tamoxifen, has not been shown to be superior to tamoxifen alone in the treatment of postmenopausal women with node-positive, ER-positive, operable breast cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a18","authors":["S E Rivkin","S Green","B Metch","A B Cruz","M D Abeloff","W R Jewell","J J Costanzi","W B Farrar","J P Minton","C K Osborne"],"doi":"10.1200\/jco.1994.12.10.2078","first_seen_on":"2017-07-20T09:21:35+00:00","issns":["0732-183X","1527-7755"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Clinical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1500542482,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7931477"],"pmid":"7931477","pubdate":"1994-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Adjuvant CMFVP versus tamoxifen versus concurrent CMFVP and tamoxifen for postmenopausal, node-positive, and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients: a Southwest Oncology Group study.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adjuvant-cmfvp-versus-tamoxifen-versus-concurrent-cmfvp-tamoxifen-postmenopausal-nodepositive-estrog"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":7133989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168674,"mean":11.698924107593,"rank":137674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168674,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8837,"mean":14.612713218651,"rank":8515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8837,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":38.40781512605,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Mathematics":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hecanhazpdf\/statuses\/887965647006822402","license":"gnip","rt":["BernieMat"],"citation_ids":[22215046,22215125,22215047],"posted_on":"2017-07-20T09:21:22+00:00","author":{"name":"shecanhazpdf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/544836075697348608\/cRflBHVx_normal.jpeg","description":"est. 2014 - does nothing but retweeting #icanhazpdf tweets all day long","id_on_source":"hecanhazpdf","tweeter_id":"2924860811","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":755},"tweet_id":"887965647006822402"}]}}
