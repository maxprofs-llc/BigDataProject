Lys) requirements of Cobb \u00d7 Cobb 500 male broilers using different statistical models. For each experiment, 1,200 chicks were housed in 48 floor pens in a completely randomized design with 6 treatments and 8 replicates. Broilers were fed diets with increasing dig. Lys levels from 1 to 12 d (Exp. 1), from 12 to 28 d (Exp. 2), and 28 to 42 d (Exp. 3). Increasing dig. Lys levels were equally spaced from 0.97 to 1.37% in Exp. 1, 0.77 to 1.17% in Exp. 2, and 0.68 to 1.07% in Exp. 3. The lowest dig. Lys diets were not supplemented with L-Lysine and all other essential AA met or exceeded recommendations. In Exp. 3, six birds per pen were randomly selected from each replication to evaluate carcass and breast yields. Digestible Lys requirements were estimated by quadratic polynomial (QP), linear broken-line (LBL), quadratic broken-line (QBL), and exponential asymptotic (EA) models. Overall, dig. Lys requirements varied among response variables and statistical models. Increasing dietary dig. Lys had a positive effect on BW, carcass and breast yields. Levels of dig. Lys that optimized performance using QP, LBL, QBL, and EA models were 1.207, 1.036, 1.113, and 1.204% for BWG and 1.190, 1.027, 1.100, and 1.172% for FCR in Exp. 1; 1.019, 0.853, 0.944; 1.025% for BWG and 1.050, 0.879, 1.032, and 1.167% for FCR in Exp. 2; and 0.960, 0.835, 0.933, and 1.077% for BWG, 0.981, 0.857, 0.963, and 1.146% for FCR in Exp. 3. The QP, LBL, QBL, and EA also estimated dig. Lys requirements as 0.941, 0.846, 0.925, and 1.070% for breast meat yield in Exp. 3. In conclusion, Lys requirements vary greatly according to the statistical analysis utilized; therefore, the origin of requirement estimation must be taken into account in order to allow adequate comparisons between references.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Henrique Scher Cemin","Sergio Luiz Vieira","Catarina Stefanello","Marcos Kipper","Liris Kindlein","Ariane Helmbrecht"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0179665","first_seen_on":"2017-07-20T06:24:42+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1501439625,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0179665","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0179665"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0179665&type=printable","pmid":"28636626","pubdate":"2017-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0179665","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Digestible lysine requirements of male broilers from 1 to 42 days of age reassessed","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/digestible-lysine-requirements-male-broilers-1-42-days-age-reassessed"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296422,"mean":6.9913019303065,"rank":7173983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296422,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190633,"mean":11.860715158001,"rank":156129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190633,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114808,"mean":10.599290792373,"rank":96828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114808,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3071,"mean":9.8666983713355,"rank":2397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3071,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
