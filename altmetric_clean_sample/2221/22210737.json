Therefore, we proposed a propensity score-matched analysis comparing the clinical outcomes between patients who underwent CABG within the first 48\u2009h of admission (early CABG) and patients who underwent CABG after 48\u2009h of admission (delayed CABG).\nUsing the largest inpatient care database in the USA, the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we identified patients with a primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction using the ICD 9-DM diagnosis codes. We then performed propensity score-matching analysis to control for 24 possible confounders.\nWe identified 31\u2009969 patients in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database with a primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction who underwent CABG. The mean age of the cohort was 64.5\u00b111.5 years and 33.4% were female. After performing propensity-matching analysis, we obtained a subset of 1555 patients in each group, with a mean age of 64.7\u00b110.1 years; the male to female ratio was ~4\u2009:\u20091. The incidence of hemorrhage, shock, and cardiac, pulmonary, and renal complications was comparable between the two groups. The incidence of mortality was not statistically significant between the two groups (2% in the early CABG vs. 1.8% in the delayed CABG, P=0.695). The mortality risk factors were as follows: age more than 70 years [odds ratio (OR): 3.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.85-6.34, P<0.001]; cardiogenic shock (OR: 3.22, 95% CI: 1.35-7.67, P=0.008); and mechanical circulatory support with balloon counterpulsation (OR: 2.93, 95% CI: 1.45-5.90, P=0.003).\nCABG performed within 48\u2009h of admission does not significantly increase the risk for in-hospital mortality compared with undergoing the procedure after 48\u2009h of admission in propensity-matched patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000584a","authors":["Ha, Le Dung","Ogunbayo, Gbolahan","Elbadawi, Ayman","Olorunfemi, Odunayo","Messerli, Adrian"],"doi":"10.1097\/mca.0000000000000537","first_seen_on":"2017-07-20T06:02:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0954-6928","1473-5830"],"journal":"Coronary artery disease","last_mentioned_on":1500530522,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/coronary-artery\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Early_versus_delayed_coronary_artery_bypass_graft.99172.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/coronary-artery\/9000\/00000\/Early_versus_delayed_coronary_artery_bypass_graft.99172.pdf","pmid":"28723830","pubdate":"2017-07-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Early versus delayed coronary artery bypass graft surgery for patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/coronary-artery\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Early_versus_delayed_coronary_artery_bypass_graft.99172.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/early-versus-delayed-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-patients-nonst-elevation-myocardial-infarc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":6258075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1114050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168673,"mean":11.698977162777,"rank":118809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168673,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":710,"mean":1.4047870239774,"rank":251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":710,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":0.778125,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CoronaryArteryD\/statuses\/887915482648465408","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22210737],"posted_on":"2017-07-20T06:02:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Coronary Artery D","url":"http:\/\/www.coronary-artery.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2328404220\/MCA_cover_normal.jpg","description":"Publishing original research with a clinical emphasis that contributes to the understanding of coronary artery disease.","id_on_source":"CoronaryArteryD","tweeter_id":"614393222","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":328},"tweet_id":"887915482648465408"}]}}
