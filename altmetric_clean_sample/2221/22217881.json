The conventional flaviviral protease constructs used for structural studies contain the NS2B cofactor region linked to the NS3 protease domain via a glycine-rich flexible linker. Here, we examined the structural dynamics of this conventional Zika protease (gZiPro) using NMR spectroscopy. Although the glycine-rich linker in gZiPro does not alter the overall folding of the protease in solution, gZiPro is not homogenous in ion exchange chromatography. Compared to the unlinked protease construct, the artificial linker affects the chemical environment of many residues including H51 in the catalytic triad. Our study provides a direct comparison of ZIKV protease constructs with and without an artificial linker. This article is protected by copyright.
