MRSA was identified by conventional bacterial culture techniques which were further confirmed by amplification of S. aureus-specific 16S rRNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The isolates were further analyzed for the presence of mec A gene by PCR. The antimicrobial susceptibility profiling was performed by disc diffusion method.\nThe prevalence of MRSA in the current study was 28.57% and 34.28% in cattle nasal and skin swab, respectively, with an overall prevalence of 31.43% MRSA among cattle. Buffalo nasal and skin sample showed MRSA prevalence of 54.55% and 39.4%, respectively, with 46.9% overall prevalence. PCR could detect mec A gene in 36.4% and 58% MRSA isolates from cattle and buffalo, respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility test found MRSA resistant to penicillin and oxytetracycline (88% each), cefoxitin (75%), cotrimoxazole (62%), and amoxyclav (50%). 100% sensitivity was observed against ciprofloxacin, amikacin, chloramphenicol, and gentamicin. Three (16.7%) MRSA isolates from buffalo were found resistant to vancomycin.\nCattle and buffalo were identified as a potential carrier of MRSA in Bihar (India). The isolation of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) in the current study indicates the emergence of VRSA in animal population which may be transmitted to the human beings working in close contact to the animals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53b3cf058f6100046f9","authors":["Alok Kumar","Purushottam Kaushik","Anjay","Pankaj Kumar","Manoj Kumar"],"doi":"10.14202\/vetworld.2017.593-597","first_seen_on":"2017-07-20T08:14:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["09728988","22310916","0972-8988"],"issue":"6","journal":"Veterinary World","last_mentioned_on":1500538871,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28717308?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28717308?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5499073","pmid":"28717308","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin and nasal carriage isolates from bovines and its antibiogram","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-methicillinresistant-staphylococcus-aureus-skin-nasal-carriage-isolates-bovines-antibiogr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":3897783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4166682,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168674,"mean":11.69893507556,"rank":76264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":87198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168674,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164,"mean":0.92159509202454,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Lecturer":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FoodchainDrugs\/statuses\/887947012787843072","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22214020],"posted_on":"2017-07-20T08:07:19+00:00","author":{"name":"FoodchainDrugs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/800633788216832000\/7W7yEc5K_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"FoodchainDrugs","tweeter_id":"799209282533203968","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5},"tweet_id":"887947012787843072"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mrsawatch\/statuses\/887950500615700480","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22214020],"posted_on":"2017-07-20T08:21:11+00:00","author":{"name":"MRSA Watch","url":"http:\/\/tahilla.typepad.com\/mrsawatch","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1222035691\/MRSA_9_normal.jpg","description":"MRSA News","id_on_source":"mrsawatch","tweeter_id":"41137185","geo":{"lt":48.85341,"ln":2.3488,"country":"FR"},"followers":1127},"tweet_id":"887950500615700480"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mrsainfection\/statuses\/887950489475727360","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22214020],"posted_on":"2017-07-20T08:21:08+00:00","author":{"name":"MRSA INFECTION","url":"http:\/\/www.mrsainfection.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1222048374\/MRSA_6_normal.jpg","description":"MRSA Information","id_on_source":"mrsainfection","tweeter_id":"36626253","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":723},"tweet_id":"887950489475727360"}]}}
