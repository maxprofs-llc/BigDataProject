Total 25(OH)D, 25(OH)D3, and C3-epi-25(OH)D3displayed similar demographic patterns and were strongly correlated (Spearman'sr> 0.70). Concentrations of 25(OH)D2(90th percentile) were much higher in persons aged \u226560 y (17.3 nmol\/L) than in younger age groups (\u22644.88 nmol\/L). We noted significant race-ethnicity differences in mean total 25(OH)D [non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs), Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites (NHWs): 46.6, 57.2, and 75.2 nmol\/L, respectively] and in the prevalence of total 25(OH)D <30 nmol\/L overall (24% of NHBs, 6.4% of Hispanics, and 2.3% of NHWs) as well as stratified by season (winter months: 30% of NHBs, 7.5% of Hispanics, and 3.8% of NHWs; summer months: 17% of NHBs, 4.4% of Hispanics, and 1.6% of NHWs). Persons with higher vitamin D intakes (diet, supplements, or both) and those examined during May-October had significantly higher total 25(OH)D. Significant race-ethnicity interactions in a multiple linear regression model confirmed the necessity of providing race-ethnicity-specific estimates of total 25(OH)D.\nRace-ethnicity differences in the prevalence of low total 25(OH)D remained strong even after adjustment for season to account for the NHANES design imbalance between season, latitude, and race-ethnicity. The strong correlation between C3-epi-25(OH)D3and 25(OH)D3may be because the epimer is a metabolite of 25(OH)D3.The presence of 25(OH)D2mainly in older persons is likely a result of high-dose prescription vitamin D2.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8d","authors":["Rosemary L Schleicher","Maya R Sternberg","Anne C Looker","Elizabeth A Yetley","David A Lacher","Christopher T Sempos","Christine L Taylor","Ramon A Durazo-Arvizu","Khin L Maw","Madhulika Chaudhary-Webb","Clifford L Johnson","Christine M Pfeiffer","Schleicher, Rosemary L","Sternberg, Maya R","Looker, Anne C","Yetley, Elizabeth A","Lacher, David A","Sempos, Christopher T","Taylor, Christine L","Durazo-Arvizu, Ramon A","Maw, Khin L","Chaudhary-Webb, Madhulika","Johnson, Clifford L","Pfeiffer, Christine M","R.
