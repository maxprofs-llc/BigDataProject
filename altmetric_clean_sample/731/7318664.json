Here, we demonstrated that a certain concentration of NaB effectively induced MCF-7 cell apoptosis. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to detect cell viability and the apoptosis rate. Western blotting was used to detect changes in the Bcl-2 expression level. We observed cell shape changes with microscopy. Immunofluorescence revealed some apoptotic nuclei. Electron microscopy revealed thick nucleoli, chromatin margination, reduced mitochondria, and dramatic vacuoles. Collectively, our findings elucidated the morphological mechanism by which NaB changed the ultrastructure of MCF-7 cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53b3cf058f6100046c4","authors":["Wang, Ying","Hu, Peng-Chao","Ma, Yan-Bin","Fan, Rong","Gao, Fang-Fang","Zhang, Jing-Wei","Wei, Lei"],"doi":"10.3109\/01913123.2016.1170083","endpage":"5","first_seen_on":"2016-05-10T13:50:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-0758","0191-3123"],"journal":"Ultrastructural Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1462877013,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27158913?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27158913","pubdate":"2016-05-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Sodium butyrate-induced apoptosis and ultrastructural changes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7679268,"mean":6.5932591477757,"rank":5807971,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1035082,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7679268,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267538,"mean":11.42916140945,"rank":187344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267538,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133,"mean":1.7256666666667,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":5.0285714285714,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/729981346609659904","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7318664],"posted_on":"2016-05-10T10:28:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"729981346609659904"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/statuses\/729985220762435584","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7318664],"posted_on":"2016-05-10T10:43:33+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
