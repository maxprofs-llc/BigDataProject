The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of NASH as an indication for liver transplantation (LT) in children and young adults and to characterize patient and graft survival. The study included all children and young adult patients (up to the age of 40 years) who underwent LT in the U.S. for NASH cirrhosis from the 1987-2012 United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess patient and graft survival. A total of 330 patients were included, 68% were Caucasian, and the mean BMI was 33.6 \u00b1 6.3. Age at time of LT ranged between 4 and 40 years (mean 33.9 \u00b1 6.6 years). 14 subjects were < 18 years of age at time of LT and 20 were between the ages of 18-25 years. Median follow-up after 1(st) LT was 45.8 months [10.7, 97.3]. During this time 30% of subjects (n = 100) died and 11.5% (n = 38) were re-transplanted including 13 for NASH recurrence. In conclusion, NASH can progress to end-stage liver disease requiring LT in childhood and early adulthood. A significant number of young patients transplanted for NASH cirrhosis required re-transplantation. This article is protected by copyright.
