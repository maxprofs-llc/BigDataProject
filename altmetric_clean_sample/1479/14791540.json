Quantum chemical calculations predict that proton shared between a ketone and the Lewis basic solvent molecule (dioxane or THF) activates carbonyl carbon to the point of enabling a facile heterolytic splitting of H2. Proton-catalyzed hydrogenation of a ketone in Lewis basic solvent is the result. The mechanism is that interaction of H2 with the enhanced Lewis acidity of carbonyl carbon and the free Lewis basic solvent molecule polarizes H2 and enables the hydride-type attack on carbonyl carbon which is very strongly influenced by a proton shared between a ketone and solvent. The hydride-type attack on carbon is reminiscent of the splitting of H2 by singlet carbenes except that in our case a Lewis base from environment (solvent) is necessary for polarization of H2 and acceptance of the proton resulting from the heterolytic splitting of H2.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Heshmat, Mojgan","Privalov, Timofei"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201605443","first_seen_on":"2016-12-16T10:49:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-3765"],"journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1481885357,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201605443\/abstract;jsessionid=91B8A2245DE8C8DB9B72B9910709688C.f01t02?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+17th+December+2016+at+09%3A00+GMT%2F+04%3A00+EST%2F+17%3A00+SGT+for+4hrs+due+to+essential+maintenance.Apologies+for+the+inconvenience"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201605443\/pdf","pmid":"27883245","pubdate":"2016-12-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"A Prediction of Proton-Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Ketones in Lewis Basic Solvent via Facile Splitting of Hydrogen Molecule","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prediction-protoncatalyzed-hydrogenation-ketones-lewis-basic-solvent-through-facile-splitting-hydrog"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7896890,"mean":6.6848881279648,"rank":6837677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7896890,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251977,"mean":12.39112073372,"rank":205588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251977,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5701,"mean":3.1112954385965,"rank":4071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5701,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":683,"mean":3.3594897360704,"rank":422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":683,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
