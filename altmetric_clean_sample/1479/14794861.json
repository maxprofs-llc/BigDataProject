Given that predators need to sample aposematic prey to learn that they are unprofitable, prey with similar warning signals share the cost of predator learning. This reduction in predation risk drives evolutionary convergence of warning signals among chemically defended prey (M\u00fcllerian mimicry). Whether such warning signal convergence is associated to similar defence levels among co-mimics is still an open question that has rarely been tested in wild populations. We quantified variation in cyanide-based (CN) chemical protection in wild caught individuals of eight aposematic Heliconius butterfly species belonging to four sympatric mimicry rings. We then tested for correlations between chemical protection and ecological species-specific traits.\nWe report significant differences in CN concentrations both within and between sympatric species, even when accounting for the phylogeny, and within and between mimicry rings, even after considering inter-specific variation. We found significant correlations between CN concentration and both hostplant specialization and gregarious behaviour in adults and larvae. However, differences in CN concentrations were not significantly linked to mimicry ring abundance, although the two most toxic species did belong to the rarest mimicry ring.\nOur results suggest that mimicry can explain the variation in the levels of chemical defence to a certain extent, although other ecological factors are also relevant to the evolution of such variability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b5","authors":["M\u00f3nica Arias","Aimilia Meichanetzoglou","Marianne Elias","Neil Rosser","Donna Lisa de-Silva","Bastien Nay","Violaine Llaurens"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12862-016-0843-5","first_seen_on":"2016-12-16T13:01:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2148"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Evolutionary Biology","last_mentioned_on":1501161785,"links":["https:\/\/bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12862-016-0843-5","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s12862-016-0843-5","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27978820?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12862-016-0843-5?site=bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC5160018","pmid":"27978820","pubdate":"2016-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"272","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Variation in cyanogenic compounds concentration within a Heliconius butterfly community: does mimicry explain everything?","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/variation-cyanogenic-compounds-concentration-within-heliconius-butterfly-community-mimicry-explain-e"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.3,"score_history":{"1y":5.3,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":1540924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6737787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273491,"mean":12.175292010676,"rank":68978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":204195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273491,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2001,"mean":9.236575,"rank":671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":1330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2001,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":9.3660952380952,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
