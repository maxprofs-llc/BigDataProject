A microcavity array with a high density three-dimensional cell culture\u00a0served as a functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) phantom for sodium multi quantum (MQ) spectroscopy. Direct contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI revealed the homogenous distribution of biochemical substances inside the bioreactor. NMR experiments using advanced bioreactors have advantages with respect to having full control over a variety of physiological parameters such as temperature, gas composition and fluid flow. Simultaneous detection of single quantum (SQ) and triple quantum (TQ) MR signals improves accuracy and was achieved by application of a pulse sequence with a\u00a0time proportional phase increment (TQTPPI). The time course of the Na-\/K-ATPase inhibition in the cell culture was demonstrated by the corresponding alterations of sodium TQ\/SQ MR signals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Andreas Neubauer","Cordula Nies","Victor D.
