However, acquired resistance to sorafenib has been found in some HCC patients, resulting in poor prognosis. It is reported that PD-L1 and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) contribute to drug resistance. In this study, by inducing sorafenib-resistant HCC cell lines, we investigated their molecular and functional characteristics. Our data indicated that highly upregulated DNMT1 was positively correlated with PD-L1 overexpression in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. We demonstrate that PD-L1 regulate DNMT1 through STAT3 signaling pathway. Knockdown of PD-L1 induced DNMT1-dependent DNA hypomethylation and restored the expression of methylation-silenced CDH1. Moreover, inactivation of NF\u03baB blocked PD-L1\/STAT3\/DNMT1 pathway in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. Functionally, genetic or pharmacological disruption of PD-L1 or\/and DNMT1 sensitize HCC resistance to sorafenib. Importantly, dual inactivation of PD-L1 and DNMT1 by their inhibitor synergistically disrupts the colony formation of sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. These results demonstrate that targeting NF\u03baB\/PDL1\/STAT3\/DNMT1 axis is a new therapeutic strategy for preventing or overcoming the acquired resistance to sorafenib in HCC patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000837e","authors":["Liu, Jianhua","Liu, Yahui","Meng, Lingyu","Liu, Kai","Ji, Bai"],"doi":"10.3892\/or.2017.5722","first_seen_on":"2017-06-21T10:14:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1021-335X","1791-2431"],"journal":"Oncology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1498040045,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28627705?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28627705","pubdate":"2017-06-21T22:15:22+00:00","publisher":"Spandidos Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Targeting the PD-L1\/DNMT1 axis in acquired resistance to sorafenib in human hepatocellular carcinoma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeting-pdl1dnmt1-axis-acquired-resistance-sorafenib-human-hepatocellular-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":7263534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237167,"mean":12.9308699139,"rank":194033,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237167,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1639,"mean":1.6363431013431,"rank":961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1639,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":0.48421052631579,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/immuno_onc\/statuses\/877469664527302657","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21216728],"posted_on":"2017-06-21T10:14:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Immuno-Oncology","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"immuno_onc","tweeter_id":"826136789677174785","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":42},"tweet_id":"877469664527302657"}]}}
