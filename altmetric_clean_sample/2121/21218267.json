The present study aimed to assess whether passive transmission of non-viral vectors to the surrounding areas of chicken embryos could be an alternate mechanism in chicken sperm-mediated gene transfer. First, the presence of nucleases in rooster seminal plasma was evaluated. Semen ejaculates from five roosters were centrifuged and the supernatant was incubated with pBL2 for 1\u2005h. A robust nuclease cocktail was detected in the rooster semen. To overcome these nucleases, plasmid-TransIT combinations were incubated with semen for 1\u2005h. Incubation of exogenous DNA in the lipoplex structure could considerably bypass the semen nuclease effect. Then, intravaginal insemination of 1 \u00d7 10(9) sperm mixed with lipoplexes (40 \u00b5g pBL2:40 \u00b5l TransIT) was carried out in 15 virgin hens. Neither the epithelial tissue from the inseminated female reproductive tracts nor the produced embryos following artificial insemination showed the transgene. To remove any bias in the transgene transmission possibility, the plasmid-TransIT admixture was directly injected in close vicinity of the embryos in newly laid eggs. Nonetheless, none of the produced fetuses or chicks carried the transgene. In conclusion, the results of the present study revealed a nuclease admixture in rooster seminal plasma, and passive\/active transmission of the non-viral vector into close vicinity of the chicken embryo was inefficient for producing transgenic chicks.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e2e","authors":["Shahram CHAPARIAN","Ahad ABDULAHNEJAD","Farzad RASHIDI","Majid TOGHYANI","Abbasali GHEISARI","Shahin EGHBALSAIED"],"doi":"10.1262\/jrd.2015-176","first_seen_on":"2017-06-21T11:45:07+00:00","issns":["0916-8818","1348-4400"],"journal":"Journal of Reproduction and Development","last_mentioned_on":1498045493,"links":["https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/jrd\/62\/3\/62_2015-176\/_article"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/jrd\/62\/3\/62_2015-176\/_pdf","pmid":"26935324","pubdate":"2016-06-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"THE SOCIETY FOR REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Is passive transmission of non-viral vectors through artificial insemination of sperm-DNA mixtures sufficient for chicken transgenesis?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/passive-transmission-nonviral-vectors-through-artificial-insemination-spermdna-mixtures-sufficient-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":4487451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2339249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237168,"mean":12.930810964426,"rank":131921,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":83210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237168,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165,"mean":1.3538414634146,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
