To establish a light and portable prokaryotic genome annotation pipeline for use in individual laboratories, we developed a Shiny app package designated as \"P-CAPS\" (Prokaryotic Contig Annotation Pipeline Server). The package is composed of R and Python scripts that integrate publicly available annotation programs into a server application. P-CAPS is not only a browser-based interactive application but also a distributable Shiny app package that can be installed on any personal computer. The final annotation is provided in various standard formats and is summarized in an R markdown document. Annotation can be visualized and examined with a public genome browser. A benchmark test showed that the annotation quality and completeness of P-CAPS were reliable and compatible with those of currently available public pipelines.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d25","authors":["ParkByeonghyeok","BaekMin-Jeong","MinByoungnam","ChoiIn-Geol"],"doi":"10.1089\/cmb.2017.0066","first_seen_on":"2017-06-21T03:18:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1066-5277","1557-8666"],"journal":"Journal of Computational Biology","last_mentioned_on":1498015513,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/cmb.2017.0066?ai=su&mi=cjwv&af=R"],"pmid":"28632399","pubdate":"2017-06-21T22:02:17+00:00","publisher":" Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.  140 Huguenot Street, 3rd Floor New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA  ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Mathematics","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","computationalbiology"],"title":"Prokaryotic Contig Annotation Pipeline Server: Web Application for a Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline Based on the Shiny App Package","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prokaryotic-contig-annotation-pipeline-server-web-application-prokaryotic-genome-annotation-pipeline"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":6377705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1140295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237167,"mean":12.930950026563,"rank":168363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237167,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":451,"mean":2.4091955555556,"rank":285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":451,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.5492,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
