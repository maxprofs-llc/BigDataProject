Therefore, attentional selection is modulated by expectations regarding behavior of others (Perez-Osorio, M\u00fcller, Wiese, & Wykowska, 2015). In this article, we examined-using the ERPs of the EEG signal-which stages of processing are influenced by expectations about others' action steps. We used a paradigm in which a gaze-cueing procedure was embedded in successively presented naturalistic photographs composing an action sequence. Our results showed (a) behavioral gaze-cueing effects modulated by whether the observed agent gazed at an object that was expected to be gazed at, according to the action sequence; (b) the N1 component locked to the onset of a target was modulated both by spatial gaze validity and participants' expectations about where the agent would gaze to perform an action; (c) a more positive amplitude, locked to the shift of gaze direction for action-congruent gaze, relative to incongruent and neutral conditions-over parieto-occipital areas in the time window between 280 and 380 ms. Taken together, these findings revealed that confirmation or violation of expectations concerning others' goal-oriented actions modulate attentional selection processes, as indexed by early ERP components.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033eb","authors":["Perez\u2010Osorio, Jairo","M\u00fcller, Hermann J.","Wykowska, Agnieszka"],"doi":"10.1111\/psyp.12854","first_seen_on":"2017-03-28T16:07:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0048-5772","1469-8986","1540-5958"],"journal":"Psychophysiology","last_mentioned_on":1491064988,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/psyp.12854\/abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/psyp.12854"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/psyp.12854\/pdf","pmid":"28370027","pubdate":"2017-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["psychophysiology"],"title":"Expectations regarding action sequences modulate electrophysiological correlates of the gaze-cueing effect","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expectations-regarding-action-sequences-modulate-electrophysiological-correlates-gazecueing-effect"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":2.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":3636556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4772251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249018,"mean":13.261201845657,"rank":103398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":143561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249018,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":993,"mean":6.5269899193548,"rank":449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":993,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":3.8035744680851,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
