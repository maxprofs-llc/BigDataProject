Abnormalities in these proteins are also implicated in different cardiovascular disorders. However, specific roles of the cavin-1 protein in cardiac and coronary responses to mechanical\/metabolic perturbation remain unclear. We characterised cardiovascular impacts of cavin-1 deficiency, comparing myocardial and coronary phenotypes and responses to stretch and ischaemia-reperfusion in hearts from cavin-1 (+\/+) and cavin-1 (-\/-) mice. Caveolae and caveolins 1 and 3 were depleted in cavin-1 (-\/-) hearts. Cardiac ejection properties in situ were modestly reduced in cavin-1 (-\/-) mice. While peak contractile performance in ex vivo myocardium from cavin-1 (-\/-) and cavin-1 (+\/+) mice was comparable, intrinsic beating rate, diastolic stiffness and Frank-Starling behaviour (stretch-dependent diastolic and systolic forces) were exaggerated in cavin-1 (-\/-) hearts. Increases in stretch-dependent forces were countered by NOS inhibition (100\u00a0\u00b5M L-NAME), which exposed negative inotropy in cavin-1 (-\/-) hearts, and were mimicked by 100\u00a0\u00b5M nitroprusside. In contrast, chronotropic differences appeared largely NOS-independent. Cavin-1 deletion also induced NOS-dependent coronary dilatation, \u22653-fold prolongation of reactive hyperaemic responses, and exaggerated pressure-dependence of coronary flow. Stretch-dependent efflux of lactate dehydrogenase and cardiac troponin I was increased and induction of brain natriuretic peptide and c-Fos inhibited in cavin-1 (-\/-) hearts, while ERK1\/2 phospho-activation was preserved. Post-ischaemic dysfunction and damage was also exaggerated in cavin-1 (-\/-) hearts. Diverse effects of cavin-1 deletion reveal important roles in both NOS-dependent and -independent control of cardiac and coronary functions, together with governing sarcolemmal fragility and myocardial responses to stretch and ischaemia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000238b","authors":["Kaakinen, Mika","Reichelt, Melissa E","Ma, Zhibin","Ferguson, Charles","Martel, Nick","Porrello, Enzo R","Hudson, James E","Thomas, Walter G","Parton, Robert G","Headrick, John P","Mika Kaakinen","Melissa E.
