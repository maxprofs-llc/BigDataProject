We have therefore studied the genetic diversity and phylogeny of root nodule bacteria isolated from V. cracca, V. hirsuta, V. sepium, V. tetrasperma and V. sylvatica growing in different locations in Sweden as well as an isolate each from V. cracca in Troms\u00f8, Norway, and V. multicaulis in Siberia, Russia. Out of 25 isolates sampled from the six Vicia species in 12 different locations, there were 14 different genotypes based on the atpD, recA and nodA gene phylogenies. All isolates were classified into Rhizobium leguminosarum sv. viciae group based on the concatenated atpD and recA phylogeny and the nodA phylogeny.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f610006756","authors":["Osei Yaw Ampomah","Kerstin Huss-Danell"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.syapm.2016.02.002","first_seen_on":"2017-03-28T14:05:32+00:00","issns":["07232020"],"journal":"Systematic & Applied Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1490709918,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26924220?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26924220","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Genetic diversity of rhizobia nodulating native Vicia spp. in Sweden","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0723202016000217","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-diversity-rhizobia-nodulating-native-vicia-spp-sweden"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":7280588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248318,"mean":13.254442410306,"rank":205605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248318,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":491,"mean":2.6875306122449,"rank":412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":491,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":3.1964285714286,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
