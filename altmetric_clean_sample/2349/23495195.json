Cardinal symptoms of this disease included root rot and wilting leaves. A fungus was isolated from diseased tissues consistently. Based on the morphological features and molecular analysis of the ITS-5.8S rDNA and D1\/D2 domain of the 28S rRNA gene, it was identified as Plectosphaerella cucumerina. This is the first report of P. cucumerina causing cabbage root rot in China and the world.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000424c","authors":["Li, Pan-Liang","Chai, A-Li","Shi, Yan-Xia","Xie, Xue-Wen","Li, Bao-Ju"],"doi":"10.5941\/myco.2017.45.2.110","first_seen_on":"2017-08-07T17:36:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1229-8093","2092-9323"],"issue":"2","journal":"Mycobiology","last_mentioned_on":1502127365,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28781545?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5541146","pmid":"28781545","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Mycobiology (KAMJE)","title":"First Report of Root Rot Caused by Plectosphaerella cucumerina on Cabbage in China","type":"article","volume":"45"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":7208005,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175858,"mean":12.089495885862,"rank":143839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175858,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":1.436752293578,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BrassicaPapers\/statuses\/894613129912393728","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23495195],"posted_on":"2017-08-07T17:36:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Brassica Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/777279358180261889\/b9HC9dcZ_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot for papers on #Brassica pulled from @ncbi_pubmed and @biorxivpreprint.
