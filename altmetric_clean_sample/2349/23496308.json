Molecular testing was performed using PCR based techniques to define the variant and to analyse other interacting mutations in either \u03b1 or \u03b2 globin genes.\nOf 94 subjects, molecular analysis confirmed the Hb FB variant in 55 samples (38 non-cord and 17 cord blood). A total of 36\/38 non-cord samples were heterozygous for the variant, while all 17 cord blood samples were heterozygotes. A total of 43\/55 individuals had a concomitant \u03b1 and\/or \u03b2 globin gene mutation.\nHb FB is the the most common \u03b1 variant in the Omani population. We report the different HPLC profiles of this variant that we observed, with and without other haemoglobinopathies in non-cord and cord blood samples. This is the first report describing the HPLC profiles of this \u03b1 globin chain variant on 1\u2009year follow-up testing of cord blood samples. With careful analysis by HPLC, it is possible not only to identify Hb FB but also to predict any concomitant \u03b1 and\/or \u03b2 globin gene mutations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d02","authors":["Shahina Daar","Shoaib Al Zadjali","Salam Alkindi","Yasser Wali","Abdulhakeem Al-Rawas","Humood Al-Haddabi","Arwa Z Al-Riyami"],"doi":"10.1136\/jclinpath-2017-204617","first_seen_on":"2017-08-07T18:46:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1472-4146"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1502131596,"links":["http:\/\/jcp.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2017\/08\/07\/jclinpath-2017-204617?rss=1&hootPostID=541877ae003bf18af23d889839e2f8f4"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jcp.bmj.com\/content\/jclinpath\/early\/2017\/08\/07\/jclinpath-2017-204617.full.pdf","pmid":"28784617","pubdate":"2017-08-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"jclinpath-2017-204617","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Haemoglobin Fontainebleau (HBA2: c. 64G&gt;C) in Oman: molecular and haematological characteristics and interaction with various haemoglobinopathies","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":6326391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1128791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175877,"mean":12.088229650436,"rank":124172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":32028,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175877,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1869,"mean":4.3163468950749,"rank":1509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1869,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":1.5150943396226,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JClinPath_BMJ\/statuses\/894630876193193984","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23496308],"posted_on":"2017-08-07T18:46:36+00:00","author":{"name":"JClinPath_BMJ","url":"http:\/\/jcp.bmj.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/784395304313425921\/s8koXCTc_normal.jpg","description":"Journal of Clinical Pathology (JCP) is a leading international journal covering all aspects of pathology.","id_on_source":"JClinPath_BMJ","tweeter_id":"143021205","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1355},"tweet_id":"894630876193193984"}]}}
