The treatment of this pathogen is often difficult due to its innate and acquired resistance to almost all commercially available antibiotics. Infections with carbapenem-associated multidrug resistant A. baumannii is the most problematic. Glutathione is a tripeptide thiol-antioxidant and antibacterial activity of exogenous glutathione was reported in some bacteria. However, clinical relevance and molecular details of the antibacterial activity of glutathione are currently unclear. Seventy clinical isolates of A. baumannii including 63 carbapenem-associated multidrug resistant isolates and a type strain A. baumannii ATCC 19606 were used to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) and time-killing activity with meropenem and\/or glutathione were also determined in the carbapenem-associated multidrug resistant isolates. In addition, the roles of exogenous glutathione in multidrug efflux pumps and \u03b2-lactamase production were examined. Levels of MIC and MBC were ranged from 10 to 15mM of exogenous glutathione. All tested carbapenem-associated multidrug resistant isolates were sensitized by all tested antibiotics in combination with subinhibitory concentrations of glutathione. FIC levels of glutathione with carbapenem (meropenem) were all<0.5 and the carbapenem-associated multidrug resistant isolates were killed by subinhibitory concentrations of both glutathione and meropenem at>2log10 within 12h, suggesting glutathione synergistically interacts with meropenem. The roles of multidrug efflux pumps and \u03b2-lactamase production were excluded for the glutathione-mediated antibiotic susceptibility. Overall results demonstrate that the antibacterial activity of glutathione is clinically relevant and its synergism on antibiotics sensitizes clinical isolates of A. baumannii regardless of their resistance or susceptibility to antibiotics. This finding suggests that exogenous glutathione alone and\/or in combination with existing antibiotics may be applicable to treat infections with carbapenem-associated multidrug resistant A. baumannii.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006586","authors":["Alharbe, Roaa","Almansour, Ayidh","Kwon, Dong H."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijmm.2017.07.009","first_seen_on":"2017-08-07T17:49:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1438-4221","1618-0607"],"journal":"International Journal of Medical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1502178155,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28781060?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28781060","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Antibacterial activity of exogenous glutathione and its synergism on antibiotics sensitize carbapenem-associated multidrug resistant clinical isolates of  Acinetobacter baumannii","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antibacterial-activity-exogenous-glutathione-synergism-antibiotics-sensitize-carbapenemassociated-mu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":6331006,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1129900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179017,"mean":12.230480962596,"rank":126536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":32523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179017,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":390,"mean":3.0970077120823,"rank":277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":390,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.9884615384615,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/A_baumannii\/statuses\/894616403428360192","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23495479],"posted_on":"2017-08-07T17:49:06+00:00","author":{"name":"A. baumannii","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/789866501184585728\/5gMV-dsG_normal.jpg","description":"bot that pushes A. baumannii pubs from PubMed","id_on_source":"A_baumannii","tweeter_id":"789292797044064256","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":16},"tweet_id":"894616403428360192"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ndm1bacteria\/statuses\/894826156456681472","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23495479],"posted_on":"2017-08-08T07:42:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Dave Roberts","url":"http:\/\/www.ndm1bacteria.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1294321879\/713px-EscherichiaColi_NIAID_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"ndm1bacteria","tweeter_id":"177368473","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":545},"tweet_id":"894826156456681472"}]}}
