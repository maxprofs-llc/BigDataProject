Pancreatic fistulas and leaks are primarily managed conservatively. Overall, conservative measures are successful in more than half of cases. Whenever conservative treatment is not efficient, surgery is usually considered the treatment of choice. Nowadays however, endoscopic treatment is being increasingly considered and employed in many cases, as a surgery sparing intervention.\nTo introduce a classification of pancreatic fistulas according to the location of the leak and ductal anatomy and finally propose the best suited endoscopic method to treat the leak according to current literature.\nWe performed an extensive review of the literature on pancreatic fistulae and leaks.\nIn this paper, we review the various types of leaks and propose a novel endoscopic classification of pancreatic fistulas in order to standardize and improve endoscopic treatment.\nA proper and precise diagnosis should be made before embarking on endoscopic treatment for pancreatic leaks in order to obtain prime therapeutic results. A multidisciplinary team of interventional endoscopists, pancreatic surgeons, and interventional radiologists is best suited to care for these patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002709","authors":["Mutignani, Massimiliano","Dokas, Stefanos","Tringali, Alberto","Forti, Edoardo","Pugliese, Francesco","Cintolo, Marcello","Manta, Raffaele","Dioscoridi, Lorenzo","Massimiliano Mutignani","Stefanos Dokas","Alberto Tringali","Edoardo Forti","Francesco Pugliese","Marcello Cintolo","Raffaele Manta","Lorenzo Dioscoridi"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10620-017-4697-5","first_seen_on":"2017-08-07T17:22:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0163-2116","1573-2568"],"journal":"Digestive Diseases & Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1506949193,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28780610?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10620-017-4697-5?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10620-017-4697-5.pdf","pmid":"28780610","pubdate":"2017-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hepatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Transplant Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Pancreatic Leaks and Fistulae: An Endoscopy-Oriented Classification","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pancreatic-leaks-fistulae-endoscopyoriented-classification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":1.25,"1w":1.25,"6d":1.25,"5d":1.25,"4d":1.25,"3d":1.25,"2d":1.25,"1d":1.25,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8459245,"mean":7.1062594182092,"rank":4020859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4250546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8459245,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226069,"mean":12.67878760373,"rank":104541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":114661,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226069,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1677,"mean":3.6005381861575,"rank":811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1677,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":3.6075,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/894609728185053184","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23494927],"posted_on":"2017-08-07T17:22:34+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":384},"tweet_id":"894609728185053184"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UpperGIResearch\/statuses\/914767937994727424","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23494927],"posted_on":"2017-10-02T08:24:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Roux Library","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/887770360858517510\/EZgWCK-P_normal.jpg","description":"Virtual Twitter library curating the latest upper gastrointestinal surgery research. #UpperGIResearch #HPB #Bariatrics #OG #FOAMed #EBM #SurgicalResearch","id_on_source":"UpperGIResearch","tweeter_id":"887766412558815233","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":535},"tweet_id":"914767937994727424"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rebgross\/statuses\/914837341545607169","license":"gnip","rt":["UpperGIResearch"],"citation_ids":[23494927],"posted_on":"2017-10-02T12:59:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Rebecca Grossman","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/844662747841413120\/qhwG0mR__normal.jpg","description":"Specialist Registrar in General #Surgery. @MedicalWomenUK Regional Representative.
