CTCs are considered to be the precursor of cancer metastasis. As a critical component of liquid biopsies, CTCs are a unique tool to understand the formation of metastasis and a valuable source of information on intratumor heterogeneity. Much effort has been invested in technologies for the detection of CTCs because they are rare cells among the vast number of blood cells. Studies in various cancers have repeatedly demonstrated that increased CTC counts prior to or during treatment are significantly associated with poor outcomes. In the new era of precision medicine, the study of CTCs reaches far beyond detection and counting. The rapidly growing field of analytical platforms for rare-cell analysis allows in-depth characterization of CTCs at the bulk cell and single-cell level. Genetic profiling of CTCs may provide an insight into the real-time tumor status, may allow the monitoring and evaluation of treatment response in clinical routine, and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic targets as well.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9253cf058f61000dcdd","authors":["Shukun Chen","Amin El-Heliebi","Thomas Kroneis"],"book":[],"doi":"10.1016\/bs.acc.2017.06.001","first_seen_on":"2017-08-07T14:40:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00652423","0065-2423"],"journal":"Advances in clinical chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1502116803,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S006524231730032X"],"pmid":"28939214","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistryclinical"],"title":"Biological and Molecular Characterization of Circulating Tumor Cells: A Creative Strategy for Precision Medicine?","type":"chapter","volume":"82","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biological-molecular-characterization-circulating-tumor-cells-creative-strategy-precision-medicine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":6326374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1128755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175816,"mean":12.092182851292,"rank":124158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175816,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":1.6997064220183,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
