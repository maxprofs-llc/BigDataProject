In this study we explored the contribution of added functionalities of benzenesulfonamide inhibitors to the intrinsic binding affinity, enthalpy, and entropy for recombinant human carbonic anhydrases (CA) CA\u2005I, CA\u2005II, CA\u2005VII, CA\u2005IX, CA\u2005XII, and CA\u2005XIII. The binding enthalpies of compounds possessing similar chemical structures and affinities were found to be very different, spanning a range from -90 to +10\u2005kJ\u2009mol(-1) , and are compensated by a similar opposing entropy contribution. The intrinsic parameters of binding were determined by subtracting the linked protonation reactions. The sulfonamide group pKa values of the compounds were measured spectrophotometrically, and the protonation enthalpies were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Herein we describe the development of meta- or ortho-substituted fluorinated benzenesulfonamides toward the highly potent compound 10\u2009h, which exhibits an observed dissociation constant value of 43\u2005pm and an intrinsic dissociation constant value of 1.1\u2005pm toward CA\u2005IX, an anticancer target that is highly overexpressed in various tumors. Fluorescence thermal shift assays, ITC, and X-ray crystallography were all applied in this work.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e5f","authors":["Zubrien\u0117, Asta","Smirnov, Alexey","Dudutien\u0117, Virginija","Timm, David D.","Matulien\u0117, Jurgita","Michailovien\u0117, Vilma","Zak\u0161auskas, Audrius","Manakova, Elena","Gra\u017eulis, Saulius","Matulis, Daumantas","Asta Zubrien\u0117","Alexey Smirnov","Virginija Dudutien\u0117","David D.
