In experimental animals, benzodiazepine (BZ) withdrawal syndrome includes anorexia and acute weight loss. The literature shows several sex-based differences in the expression of BZ dependence; however, the authors did not find studies dealing with the influence of gonadal hormones on BZ withdrawal-induced weight loss. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the effects of castration on diazepam (DZ) withdrawal-induced weight loss in rats. 2. Male (260-330 g) or female (220-260 g) Wistar rats were anesthetized with ether and submitted to surgical castration or sham-operation. Seven days later, recovered from the surgery, the animals were injected i.p. with DZ (4 mg kg-1 day-1) or appropriate vehicle (VEH; 2 ml kg-1 kg-1 day-1) for 28 days. In the next 7 days, the rats received the same doses of DZ (four groups) or VEH (eight groups). Weights of all animals were recorded daily to the nearest gram at 09:00 h. To assess the degree of weight loss and make statistical comparisons, weights over days 29-34 were expressed as percentage of those recorded in the morning of day 28. 3. Sham-operated female rats from the group DZ-VEH showed a small but statistically significant weight loss on days 29 and 30 (P < 0.05) when compared with groups VEH-VEH and DZ-DZ. Ovariectomized rats, however, did not show any significant change in body weight from days 29-34. 4. Sham-operated male rats did not exhibit any significant weight loss after DZ withdrawal. Orchidectomized animals, however, showed a small but statistically significant weight loss on day 31 (P < 0.05) when compared with groups VEH-VEH and DZ-DZ. 5. These results show a gonadal influence on DZ withdrawal-induced weight loss in Wistar rats; in particular, they also suggest that female hormones (progesterone and\/or estrogen) facilitate whilst male hormones inhibit this phenomenon.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033b5","authors":["Pires, J G","Monteiro, K C","Alvarenga, S O","Costa, M G","Gomes, M A","Futuro-Neto, H A"],"first_seen_on":"2016-12-21T15:06:14+00:00","issns":["0278-5846"],"issue":"2","journal":"Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1482274200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9608611"],"pmid":"9608611","pubdate":"1998-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology","psychiatry"],"title":"Evidence suggesting that gonadal hormones influence benzodiazepine withdrawal-induced weight loss in rats.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidence-suggesting-gonadal-hormones-influence-benzodiazepine-withdrawalinduced-weight-loss-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.328,"score_history":{"1y":7.328,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.328},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7912542,"mean":6.6949158185663,"rank":1073872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":6838222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7912542,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250827,"mean":12.400777686523,"rank":51199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":199627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250827,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1120,"mean":4.395145665773,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1120,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":5.2058823529412,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
