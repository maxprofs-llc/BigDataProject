The dog was subsequently evaluated for signs of dull mentation, anxiety, ptyalism and ataxia, thought to be a result of loperamide intoxication. The dog was treated with a 1.5 mL\/kg IV bolus of 20% ILE solution followed by 0.25 mL\/kg\/min of the same solution for 2 hours. The dog's mentation improved rapidly following ILE infusion, and he was neurologically normal 3 hours after initiation of ILE treatment. The dog was subsequently found to be homozygous for the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene (ABCB1-1\u2206) mutation. There were no adverse effects noted during or following ILE infusion.\nILE was successful in the treatment of loperamide toxicosis in a Collie with the ABCB1-1\u2206 mutation. ILE may be of benefit for treatment of other intoxications in dogs with ABCB1-1\u0394 mutations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ce3cf058f610000650","authors":["Long, Whitney M.","Sinnott, Virginia B.","Bracker, Kiko","Thomas, Danielle"],"doi":"10.1111\/vec.12562","first_seen_on":"2016-12-21T14:28:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-4431"],"journal":"Journal of Veterinary Emergency & Critical Care","last_mentioned_on":1485097224,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vec.12562\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vec.12562\/abstract?campaign=wolsavedsearch&utm_content=buffer86dad&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vec.12562\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vec.12562\/pdf","pmid":"27992655","pubdate":"2016-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"subjects":["criticalcare","emergencymedicine"],"title":"Use of 20% intravenous lipid emulsion for the treatment of loperamide toxicosis in a Collie homozygous for the ABCB1-1\u2206 mutation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/20-intravenous-lipid-emulsion-treatment-loperamide-toxicosis-collie-homozygous-abcb11-mutation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.7,"score_history":{"1y":3.7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088508,"mean":6.8823654995833,"rank":1850770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6222453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088508,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260466,"mean":12.387636726623,"rank":81259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":178220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260466,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":613,"mean":1.805045751634,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":613,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.825,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":4,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":6}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":3},"mendeley":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Albinovet\/statuses\/811579105103716352","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14910079],"posted_on":"2016-12-21T14:28:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefano Cattaneo DVM","url":"http:\/\/veterinarialbino.com\/\/twitter_en.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1673372763\/vet_tweet_normal.png","description":"Daily updates about pet health covering the last articles published in veterinary journals.","id_on_source":"Albinovet","tweeter_id":"418669767","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2115},"tweet_id":"811579105103716352"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lipidchronicles\/statuses\/814194209280364544","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14910079],"posted_on":"2016-12-28T19:40:01+00:00","author":{"name":"The Lipid Chronicles","url":"http:\/\/www.thelipidchronicles.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/732491728234516480\/ATilq-y-_normal.jpg","description":"Feed of new #lipid #research covering both structure and signalling.
