It obtains the carbon and other nutrients from the roots of surrounding autotrophic trees through the associated mycorrhizal fungi. In order to understand the evolutionary changes in the plant genome associated with transition to a heterotrophic lifestyle, we performed de novo transcriptomic analysis of M. hypopitys using next-generation sequencing. We obtained the RNA-Seq data from flowers, flower bracts and roots with haustoria using Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. The raw data obtained in this study can be available in NCBI SRA database with accession number of SRP069226. A total of 10.3\u00a0GB raw sequence data were obtained, corresponding to 103,357,809 raw reads. A total of 103,025,683 reads were filtered after removing low-quality reads and trimming the adapter sequences. The Trinity program was used to de novo assemble 98,349 unigens with an N50 of 1342\u00a0bp. Using the TransDecoder program, we predicted 43,505 putative proteins. 38,416 unigenes were annotated in the Swiss-Prot protein sequence database using BLASTX. The obtained transcriptomic data will be useful for further studies of the evolution of plant genomes upon transition to a non-photosynthetic lifestyle and the loss of photosynthesis-related functions.","altmetric_jid":"5216115b3cf058827c00001c","authors":["Beletsky, Alexey V","Filyushin, Mikhail A","Gruzdev, Eugeny V","Mazur, Alexander M","Prokhortchouk, Egor B","Kochieva, Elena Z","Mardanov, Andrey V","Ravin, Nikolai V","Skryabin, Konstantin G"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gdata.2016.11.020","endpage":"61","first_seen_on":"2016-12-21T16:01:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2213-5960","22135960"],"journal":"Genomics Data","last_mentioned_on":1482336055,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27995074"],"pmcid":"PMC5154972","pmid":"27995074","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"60","title":"De novo transcriptome assembly of the mycoheterotrophic plant Monotropa hypopitys","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novo-transcriptome-assembly-mycoheterotrophic-plant-monotropa-hypopitys"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7917108,"mean":6.6979661075636,"rank":6854485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7917108,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251087,"mean":12.400145854408,"rank":205599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251087,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":475,"mean":1.6296708860759,"rank":363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":475,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.7707272727273,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Ph.
