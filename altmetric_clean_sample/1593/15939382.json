In this study, we aimed to evaluate the radiological changes observed in the ankles after total knee arthroplasty.\nBetween May 2012 and June 2013, 80 knees of 78 patients with varus deformity over 10\u00b0 underwent total knee arthroplasty. For each patient, full-leg standing radiographs were obtained pre- and post-operatively. Mechanical and anatomical axes (HKA and AA), lateral distal femoral angle, medial proximal tibial angle, lateral distal tibial angle (LDTA), ankle joint line orientation angle (AJOA), tibial plafond talus angle (PTA) and talar shift were measured for each patient both pre- and post-operatively.\nPre-operatively, the mean HKA was 16.6\u00b0 and the mean AA was 10.41\u00b0, both in favour of varus alignment. Post-operatively, the mean HKA decreased to 3.6\u00b0 and the mean AA to -2.1. The mean LDTA was 87.3\u00b0. Before the operation, the mean AJOA was -7.6\u00b0, opening to the medial aspect of the ankle, and it was 0.04\u00b0 after the operation and opening to the lateral aspect (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nOur study reveals the changes occurring in the ankle after acute correction of long-standing varus deformity of the knee using total knee arthroplasty. In cases undergoing knee arthroplasty, effect of the acute change in the alignment of the knee on the ankle should be taken into consideration and the amount of correction should be calculated carefully in order not to damage the alignment of the ankle.\nIV.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fc1","authors":["Sarper Gursu","Hakan Sofu","Peter Verdonk","Vedat Sahin","Gursu, Sarper","Sofu, Hakan","VERDONK, PETER","Sahin, Vedat"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00167-015-3883-2","endpage":"2475","first_seen_on":"2017-01-30T08:05:46+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-8504362","handles":["1854\/LU-8504362"],"issns":["0942-2056","1433-7347"],"issue":"8","journal":"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy","last_mentioned_on":1500415256,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s00167-015-3883-2","https:\/\/biblio.ugent.be\/publication\/8504362"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00167-015-3883-2.pdf","pmid":"26590564","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2470","subjects":["generalsurgery","sportsmedicine"],"title":"Effects of total knee arthroplasty on ankle alignment in patients with varus gonarthrosis: Do we sacrifice ankle to the knee?","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s00167-015-3883-2","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-total-knee-arthroplasty-ankle-alignment-patients-varus-gonarthrosis-we-sacrifice-ankle-knee"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229472,"mean":6.9710874477773,"rank":7121641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229472,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267507,"mean":12.788562649062,"rank":221544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267507,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1182,"mean":4.630050804403,"rank":1028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1182,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":5.1980769230769,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
