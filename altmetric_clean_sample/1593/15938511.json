The objectives of the present study were to determine whether HIV risk perception was associated with greater injection and sexual risk-taking behaviors among PWIDs.\nWe surveyed 460 PWID in Kermanshah regarding their demographic characteristics, sexual risk behaviors, HIV risk perception, and drug-related risk behaviors in the month prior to the study. Three classes of HIV risk perception were identified using ordinal regression to determine factors associated with HIV risk perception.\nStudy participants were categorized as follows: \"low\" (n\u00a0=\u00a0100, 22%), \"moderate\" (n\u00a0=\u00a0150, 32%), and \"high\" (n\u00a0=\u00a0210, 46%) risk perception for becoming infected with HIV. The odds of categorizing as \"high\" risk for HIV was significantly greater in PWID that reported unprotected sex (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.4, p value 0.02), receptive syringe sharing (AOR 1.8, p value 0.01), and multiple sex partners (AOR 1.4, p value 0.03). PWID who reported unprotected sex had 2.7 times the odds of \"high\" risk perception when compared to PWID with \"low\" risk perception.\nFindings show that PWID could rate their HIV risk with acceptable accuracy. Additionally, perceived HIV risk was associated with many risk factors for transmission of HIV, emphasizing the importance of developing targeted prevention and harm reduction programs for all domains of risk behaviors, both sexual and drug-related use.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b23","authors":["Mehdi Noroozi","Elahe Ahounbar","Salah eddin Karimi","Sina Ahmadi","Mohammad Najafi","Ali Bazrafshan","Zahra Jorjoran Shushtari","Mohammad Hassan Farhadi","Peter Higgs","Fatemeh Rezaei","Hesam Ghiasvand","Asaad Sharhani","Bahram Armoon","Katherine Waye"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12529-017-9634-7","first_seen_on":"2017-01-30T07:53:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1070-5503","1532-7558"],"journal":"International Journal of Behavioral Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1487360114,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28124192"],"pmid":"28124192","pubdate":"2017-01-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"General Practice \/ Family Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"HIV Risk Perception and Risky Behavior Among People Who Inject Drugs in Kermanshah, Western Iran","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s12529-017-9634-7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hiv-risk-perception-risky-behavior-among-people-inject-drugs-kermanshah-western-iran"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":4373703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2283007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267102,"mean":12.796255468905,"rank":152249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":88211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267102,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":430,"mean":5.478372960373,"rank":239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":81,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":430,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.2277777777778,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":4}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Prison_Health\/statuses\/825973122021064704","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15938511],"posted_on":"2017-01-30T07:45:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Prison_Health","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/492953414\/Prison_normal.jpg","description":"Jail, Prison, Criminology, Corrections, et al Also @Hlth_Literacy @HIV_Insight, @Sex_Worker_Hlth","id_on_source":"Prison_Health","tweeter_id":"85601740","geo":{"lt":21.30694,"ln":-157.85833,"country":"US"},"followers":13694},"tweet_id":"825973122021064704"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Hlth_Literacy\/statuses\/825973122734096385","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15938511],"posted_on":"2017-01-30T07:45:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Health Literacy","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/731064960\/LiteracyII_normal.jpg","description":"Eclectic health info, Health Literacy  Also @HIV_Insight @Prison_Health, @Why_We_Do_That, @Sex_Worker_Hlth","id_on_source":"Hlth_Literacy","tweeter_id":"77314206","geo":{"lt":21.30694,"ln":-157.85833,"country":"US"},"followers":6036},"tweet_id":"825973122734096385"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Sex_Worker_Hlth\/statuses\/825973122302091265","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15938511],"posted_on":"2017-01-30T07:45:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Sex_Worker_Hlth","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/781973423\/ruth-palmer-deep-purple-mist_normal.jpg","description":"Commercial Sex Worker Health Information.
