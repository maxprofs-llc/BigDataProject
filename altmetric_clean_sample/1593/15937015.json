A survey underpinned by AT legislations and established guidelines for practice was completed by 318 certified AT providers. More than 30% of the providers reported their education and training as inadequate to fulfil four of the seven primary roles of ATS. Nearly 90% of providers expressed awareness of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) domains for interdisciplinary communication. However, only 45% felt that they could effectively utilize the ICF in their documentation. About 75% of the providers acknowledged the lack of a recognized standard for the provision of services. Prevailing inadequacies in funding were negatively impacting the quality of ATS, as expressed by 88% of respondents. Translation of evidence to practice was identified as a major challenge by 41% of service providers. Providers were predominantly documenting outcomes through informal interviews (54%) or non-standard instruments (26%). Findings support the need for strengthening professional curriculum, pre-service and in-service training and an established standard to support effective, interdisciplinary AT services and data collection to support public policy decisions. Implications for Rehabilitation This study validates the need to strengthen education and training of AT service providers by enhancing professional curriculum as well as their engagement in pre-service and in-service training activities. This study draws attention to health care funding policies and practices that critically impact the quality of AT services. This study signifies the need for an established interdisciplinary standard among AT professionals to support effective communication, service coordination and outcomes measurement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005890","authors":["Sajay Arthanat","Linda-Jeanne Elsaesser","Stephen Bauer"],"doi":"10.1080\/17483107.2016.1265015","endpage":"15","first_seen_on":"2017-01-30T06:30:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1748-3107","1748-3115"],"journal":"Disability & Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology","last_mentioned_on":1485771591,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17483107.2016.1265015?utm_content=bufferdfeec&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17483107.2016.1265015?utm_content=bufferdfeec&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer&"],"pmid":"28125297","pubdate":"2017-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"A survey of assistive technology service providers in the USA","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17483107.2016.1265015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/survey-assistive-technology-service-providers-usa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154593,"mean":6.8923629076653,"rank":3644955,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4419583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154593,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262670,"mean":12.80994888624,"rank":117839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":140472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262670,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256,"mean":2.410737254902,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.6142857142857,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Sports and Recreations":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EmilySteelOT\/statuses\/825954229361770496","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15937015],"posted_on":"2017-01-30T06:30:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Emily Steel","url":"https:\/\/au.linkedin.com\/in\/emilysteel","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/814657183140888577\/r4mKXh55_normal.jpg","description":"Senior Lecturer, USQ School of Health & Wellbeing.
