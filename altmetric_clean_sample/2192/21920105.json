Currently, network meta-analyses are undertaken either within the Bayesian hierarchical linear models or frequentist generalized linear mixed models. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a statistical method originally developed for modeling causal relations among observed and latent variables. As random effect is explicitly modeled as a latent variable in SEM, it is very flexible for analysts to specify complex random effect structure and to make linear and nonlinear constraints on parameters. The aim of this article is to show how to undertake a network meta-analysis within the statistical framework of SEM.\nWe used an example dataset to demonstrate the standard fixed and random effect network meta-analysis models can be easily implemented in SEM. It contains results of 26 studies that directly compared three treatment groups A, B and C for prevention of first bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis. We also showed that a new approach to network meta-analysis based on the technique of unrestricted weighted least squares (UWLS) method can also be undertaken using SEM.\nFor both the fixed and random effect network meta-analysis, SEM yielded similar coefficients and confidence intervals to those reported in the previous literature. The point estimates of two UWLS models were identical to those in the fixed effect model but the confidence intervals were greater. This is consistent with results from the traditional pairwise meta-analyses. Comparing to UWLS model with common variance adjusted factor, UWLS model with unique variance adjusted factor has greater confidence intervals when the heterogeneity was larger in the pairwise comparison. The UWLS model with unique variance adjusted factor reflects the difference in heterogeneity within each comparison.\nSEM provides a very flexible framework for univariate and multivariate meta-analysis, and its potential as a powerful tool for advanced meta-analysis is still to be explored.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007c6","authors":["Yu-Kang Tu","Yun-Chun Wu"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12874-017-0390-9","first_seen_on":"2017-07-15T10:07:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1471-2288"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Medical Research Methodology","last_mentioned_on":1500332291,"links":["https:\/\/bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12874-017-0390-9","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s12874-017-0390-9"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12874-017-0390-9?site=bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28709406","pubdate":"2017-07-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"104","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Using structural equation modeling for network meta-analysis","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/using-structural-equation-modeling-network-metaanalysis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223669,"mean":6.9683210333815,"rank":6245130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1106855,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223669,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184786,"mean":11.50151879211,"rank":130754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":33938,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184786,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":837,"mean":6.3195023923445,"rank":676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":837,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":4.9892857142857,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
