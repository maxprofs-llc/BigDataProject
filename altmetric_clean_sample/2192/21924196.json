The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) utilizes a minimization\/denial (MD) scale to denote potential under-reporters of trauma, yet MD scores are infrequently reported and validations of the scale are lacking in the literature.\nElucidate differences in MD between patients with severe mental disorders to healthy individuals, and secondly, investigate if MD influences reports of childhood trauma between the groups. Methods: We included 621 patients with a DSM-schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar spectrum diagnosis, or major depression disorder with psychotic features and 299 healthy controls as part of the NORMENT study in Oslo, Norway. History of childhood trauma was obtained using the CTQ. Clinical diagnoses were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders. Results: A significantly greater proportion of healthy controls (42.8%) had a positive MD score compared to patients (26.7%). When controlling for MD, the patient group still exhibited elevated reports of childhood trauma compared to controls (Cohen's d = 1.27), concordant with reports of childhood trauma being more frequently reported in a population of severe mental disorders. Conclusion: Elevated MD in the healthy control group could suggest an enhanced self-serving bias, potentially attenuated in the psychiatric group. Clinicians and researchers would benefit from including the MD component of CTQ when assessing retrospective information on childhood trauma to rule out potential effect of MD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc1b","authors":["Church, Chelsea","Andreassen, Ole A","Lorentzen, Steinar","Melle, Ingrid","Aas, Monica","Andreassen, Ole A.","Chelsea Church","Ole A.
