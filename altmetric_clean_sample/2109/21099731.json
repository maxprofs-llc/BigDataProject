Others have shown that administration a TH2 cytokine, IL-13 is sufficient to cause mucus hypersecretion in vivo and in vitro. Asthma therapy often utilizes \u03b22-adrenoceptor (\u03b22AR) agonists, which are effective acutely as bronchodilators, however chronic use may lead to a worsening of asthma symptoms. In this study, we asked whether \u03b22AR signaling in normal human airway epithelial (NHBE) cells affected mucin production in response to IL-13. This cytokine markedly increased mucin production, but only in the presence of epinephrine. Mucin production was blocked by ICI-118,551, a preferential \u03b22AR antagonist, but not by CGP-20712A, a preferential \u03b21AR antagonist. Constitutive \u03b22AR activity was not sufficient for IL-13 induced mucin production and \u03b2-agonist-induced signaling is required. A clinically important long-acting \u03b2-agonist, formoterol, was as effective as epinephrine in potentiating IL-13 induced MUC5AC transcription. IL-13 induced mucin production in the presence of epinephrine was significantly reduced by treatment with selective inhibitors of ERK1\/2 (FR180204), p38 (SB203580) and JNK (SP600125). Replacement of epinephrine with forskolin + IBMX resulted in a marked increase in mucin production in NHBE cells in response to IL-13, and treatment with the inhibitory cAMP analogue Rp-cAMPS decreased mucin levels induced by epinephrine + IL-13. Our findings suggest that \u03b22AR signaling is required for mucin production in response to IL-13, and that mitogen activated protein kinases and cAMP are necessary for this effect. These data lend support to the notion that \u03b22AR-agonists may contribute to asthma exacerbations by increasing mucin production via activation of \u03b22ARs on epithelial cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Nour Al-Sawalha","Indira Pokkunuri","Ozozoma Omoluabi","Hosu Kim","Vaidehi J.
