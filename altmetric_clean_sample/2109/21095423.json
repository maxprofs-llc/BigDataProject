Survival analysis was conducted through the Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank testing.\nA total of 38,264 patients with T1a kidney cancer were identified in the period from 2004-2013. Five-year kidney cancer-specific survival rates show a progressive decline with increasing tumor size. Moreover, kidney cancer-specific survival has been compared according to the initial local treatment modality (observation, ablation, partial or radical nephrectomy) across different size categories (<1 cm, 1-2 cm, 2-3 cm and 3-4 cm). Survival curves of different treatment modalities were almost overlapping for patients with renal mass <1cm. For patients with tumor size 1-2 cm, treatment modalities were overlapping at the first 60 months, then the curve of observation diverged (P <0.0001). For patients with tumor size 2-3 cm and 3-4 cm, the curve of observation diverged early in the time course (P <0.0001).\nPrimary tumor size is an important factor that should be taken into consideration when evaluating the different treatment options for patients with small kidney cancers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073cb","authors":["Omar Abdel-Rahman"],"doi":"10.1080\/14737140.2017.1340838","first_seen_on":"2017-06-16T00:51:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-7140","1744-8328"],"journal":"Expert Review of Anticancer Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1497574279,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/14737140.2017.1340838?ai=1ps5q&mi=ianpxd&af=R"],"pmid":"28593803","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Impact of tumor size on the outcome of patients with small renal cell carcinoma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-tumor-size-outcome-patients-small-renal-cell-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":7244346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":219740,"mean":13.128703325309,"rank":180478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":219740,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":586,"mean":3.0461777777778,"rank":419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":586,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.86363636363636,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ERJournals\/statuses\/875516103258189824","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21095423],"posted_on":"2017-06-16T00:51:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Expert Reviews","url":"http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/page\/ExpertReviews","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000496751182\/2258702d67dd42cedd317fb79fc5212a_normal.jpeg","description":"Expert Reviews is a leading series of 16 journals providing commentary and analysis on modern healthcare","id_on_source":"ERJournals","tweeter_id":"1886949961","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1286},"tweet_id":"875516103258189824"}]}}
