The intent is to extend McNemar's test for 1-to-2 matching (instead of 1-to-1 matching) when evaluating binary predictors and outcomes.\nWe review McNemar's approach for analyzing matched data, demonstrate the Mantel-Haenszel approach for integrating two overlapping McNemar's estimates, review conditional logistic regression as an alternative analytic approach, and introduce a new method that yields a visual display and easy verification.\nWe illustrate the new approach with real data testing the association between overcast weather and the risk of a life-threatening traffic crash (n = 6,962). We show that results from the new approach agree closely with conditional logistic regression and are sufficiently simple as to be computed on a hand-held calculator. We further validate the approach by conducting simulations when a positive association was pre-defined and when a null association was pre-defined.\nThe new approach provides a feasible, simple, and efficient method for analyzing matched designs with double controls.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cfd","authors":["Donald A.
