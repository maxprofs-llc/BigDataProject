EHV-1 strain KyA is attenuated in the mouse and equine, whereas wild-type strain RacL11 induces severe inflammation of the lung, causing infected mice to succumb at 4 to 6 days post-infection. Our previous results showed that KyA immunization protected CBA mice from pathogenic RacL11 challenge at 2 and 4 weeks post-immunization, and that the KyA infection elicited protective humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. To investigate the protective mechanisms of KyA by innate immune responses, KyA-immunized mice were challenged with RacL11 at various times post-vaccination. KyA immunization protected mice from RacL11 challenge at 1 to 7 days post-immunization. Immunized mice lost less than 10% of their body weight and rapidly regained weight. Lung virus titers in KyA-immunized mice were 1,000-fold lower at 2 days post-RacL11 challenge than titers in lungs of non-immunized mice, indicative of accelerated virus clearance. Affymetrix microarray analysis revealed that IFN-\u03b3 and 16 antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were upregulated 3.1 to 48.2-fold at 8 h post-challenge in the lungs of RacL11-challenged mice that had been immunized with KyA. Murine IFN-\u03b3 inhibited EHV-1 infection of murine alveolar macrophage cells and protected mice against lethal EHV-1 challenge, suggesting that IFN-\u03b3 expression is important in mediating protection elicited by KyA immunization. These results suggest that EHV-1 KyA may be used as a live attenuated EHV-1 vaccine as well as a prophylactic agent in horses.\nViral infection of cells initiates a signal cascade of events that ultimately attempts to limit viral replication and prevent infection through the expression of host antiviral proteins. Here, we show that EHV-1 KyA immunization effectively protected CBA mice from pathogenic RacL11 challenge at 1 to 7 days post-vaccination, and increased expression of IFN-\u03b3 and 16 antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISG). The administration of IFN-\u03b3 blocked EHV-1 replication in murine alveolar macrophages and mouse lungs and protected mice from lethal challenge. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an attenuated EHV-1 vaccine that protects the animal at 1 to 7 days post-immunization by innate immune responses. Our findings suggested that IFN-\u03b3 serves as a novel prophylactic agent and may offer new strategies for the development of anti-EHV-1 agents in the equine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Seong K.
