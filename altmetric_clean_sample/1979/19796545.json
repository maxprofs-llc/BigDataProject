Complete diagnosis requires information about the chemical composition as well as the morphological structure of a sample. We report on the development of an opto-mechanical probe that combines Raman spectroscopy (RS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), two methods that provide all the crucial information needed for a non-invasive diagnosis. The aim of this paper is to introduce the technical design, construction and optimization of a dual opto-mechanical probe combining two in-house developed devices for confocal RS and OCT. The unique benefit of the probe is a gradual acquisition of OCT and RS data, which allows to use the acquired OCT images to pinpoint locations of interest for RS measurements. The parameters and the correct functioning of the probe were verified by RS scanning of various samples (silicon wafer and ex vivo tissue) based on their OCT images - lateral as well as depth scanning was performed. Both the OCT and RS systems were developed, optimized and tested with the ultimate aim of verifying the functionality of the probe. Picture: Schematic illustration and visualization of the developed RS-OCT probe.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007ba3","authors":["Klemes, Jan","Kotzianova, Adela","Pokorny, Marek","Mojzes, Peter","Novak, Jindrich","Sukova, Lada","Demuth, Jaroslav","Vesely, Jaroslav","Sasek, Ladislav","Velebny, Vladimir"],"doi":"10.1002\/jbio.201600284","first_seen_on":"2017-05-03T00:41:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1864-0648"],"journal":"Journal of Biophotonics","last_mentioned_on":1493740824,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/jbio.201600284&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jbio.201600284\/pdf","pmid":"28464557","pubdate":"2017-05-02T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Non\u2010invasive diagnostic system and its opto\u2010mechanical probe for combining confocal Raman spectroscopy and optical coherence tomography","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/noninvasive-diagnostic-system-optomechanical-probe-combining-confocal-raman-spectroscopy-optical-coh"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161493,"mean":6.8965394462124,"rank":7066945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161493,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235328,"mean":12.55675363218,"rank":191210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235328,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":843,"mean":2.9389881235154,"rank":656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":843,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":0.86625,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
