The case group included 23 boys with ADHD, who were combined type, treatment-naive, and with normal intelligence without comorbidities. The control group (n = 30) were age and gender matched. After three months on methylphenidate, the ADHD children were retested. The control group was also retested after three months.\nBefore treatment, ADHD children had lower scores than the control group on the tests (p \u2264 0.001) and after methylphenidate had fewer test errors than before (p \u2264 0.001).\nMethylphenidate treatment improves the working memory, inhibitory control and mental flexibility of ADHD boys.","authors":["Bolfer, Cristiana","Pacheco, Sandra Pasquali","Tsunemi, Miriam Harumi","Carreira, Walter Souza","Casella, Beatriz Borba","Casella, Erasmo Barbante","Bolfer, Cristiana","Pacheco, Sandra Pasquali","Tsunemi, Miriam Harumi","Carreira, Walter Souza","Casella, Beatriz Borba","Casella, Erasmo Barbante"],"doi":"10.1590\/0004-282x20170030","first_seen_on":"2017-05-02T22:06:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1678-4227","0004-282X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria","last_mentioned_on":1493762755,"links":["http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0004-282X2017000400204#.WQkCZAgtWCQ.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/pdf\/anp\/v75n4\/0004-282X-anp-75-04-0204.pdf","pmid":"28489138","pubdate":"2017-05-11T22:02:28+00:00","publisher":"Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria","subjects":["psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder: the impact of methylphenidate on working memory, inhibition capacity and mental flexibility","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transtorno-d%C3%A9ficit-aten%C3%A7%C3%A3ohiperatividade-tdah-o-impacto-metilfenidato-na-mem%C3%B3ria-operacional-capacid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DoctorRichels\/statuses\/859529412408209409","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19794720],"posted_on":"2017-05-02T22:05:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Corrin G.
