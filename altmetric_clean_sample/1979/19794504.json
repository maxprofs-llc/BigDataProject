This study aimed to investigate the effect of pure microcystin-LR on activity and transcript level of immune-related enzymes in the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. After exposed to varying concentrations of pure microcystin-LR (MC-LR) for 30 days, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), lysozyme (LZM), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), peroxidase (POD), acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and transcript level of cMn-sod, lzm, gpx were investigated in the hepatopancreas of white shrimp (L. vannamei). Immune-related enzyme activities responded differently to MC-LR exposure. SOD, GPx, and POD activity in the hepatopancreas were activated in a concentration-dependent manner while LZM activity was significantly inhibited in the treatment groups. ACP and AKP activity showed an increase, followed by a decrease. The transcript levels of cMn-sod, lzm, and gpx were consistent with changes in their encoding enzyme activity. These results demonstrated that sub-chronical exposure to MC-LR induced the alteration of immune-related enzymes and corresponding genes in the hepatopancreas, which may help explain the presence of detoxification mechanisms in crustaceans and how they were protected from MC-LR stress for a long period of time.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f6100065da","authors":["Yanyan Chen","Xianghu Huang","Jianzhu Wang","Changling Li"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10646-017-1802-7","first_seen_on":"2017-05-02T21:49:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-3017"],"journal":"Ecotoxicology","last_mentioned_on":1493769584,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10646-017-1802-7"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10646-017-1802-7.pdf","pmid":"28466205","pubdate":"2017-05-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Effect of pure microcystin-LR on activity and transcript level of immune-related enzymes in the white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei)","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":1.1,"6m":1.1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161493,"mean":6.8965394462124,"rank":4305502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3828190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161493,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235448,"mean":12.57521211143,"rank":129257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":104605,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235448,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":729,"mean":2.6266153846154,"rank":288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":729,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":1.1256756756757,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"EC":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ecotoxicology\/statuses\/859525193403944960","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19794504],"posted_on":"2017-05-02T21:49:09+00:00","author":{"name":"ecotoxicology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/499652563751280642\/9Yw-u5dW_normal.png","description":"Ecotoxicology and Environmental Pollution  Publications Feed.
