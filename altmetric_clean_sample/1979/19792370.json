The performance of the two kinds of silk fibroin was compared to that of collagen. DSF exhibited as high a cell attachment and growth as collagen did. The cells attached to DSF were extensively spread out and their filopodia were visible in the SEM pictures. WSF, which contains the tripeptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (believed to be a specific interaction site for cell-attachment), displayed much higher cell attachment and growth compared to DSF. The cells attached on WSF became virtually flat and their filopodia could be seen, indicating that the cells were very strongly held on the surface.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Minoura, N","Aiba, S","Higuchi, M","Gotoh, Y","Tsukada, M","Imai, Y"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-02T19:58:07+00:00","issns":["0006-291X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1493685032,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7695601"],"pmid":"7695601","pubdate":"1995-03-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Attachment and growth of fibroblast cells on silk fibroin.","type":"article","volume":"208","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/attachment-growth-fibroblast-cells-silk-fibroin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161363,"mean":6.8964925866473,"rank":2063207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4968592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161363,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235445,"mean":12.575664557177,"rank":78482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":154727,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235445,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8697,"mean":2.7521501839926,"rank":673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":3559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8697,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290,"mean":1.2701730103806,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
