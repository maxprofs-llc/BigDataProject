Whether this high fat intake is associated with dyslipidaemia is unknown. We described the lipid profile and dietary intake in paediatric patients with CF.\n110 fasting lipid concentrations of 110 Dutch patients with CF were studied, along with 86 measurements of dietary intake. For the total group and for boys and girls separately, the lipid profile and the dietary intake were investigated. The cross-sectional relationship between the lipid concentrations and dietary intake was determined.\nThe mean dietary fat intake was \u226535% of the total energy intake, along with a considerable consumption of saturated fat. We found lower concentrations of cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased concentrations of triglyceride and triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios. Lipid concentrations were not associated with dietary fat intake.\nThis study lacks variation in dietary fat intake to exclude an effect on lipid concentrations as the distribution of dietary fat intake remained constant at a high level. Elevated triglyceride concentrations and triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios suggest an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Any negative consequences of a high dietary fat intake on the overall lipid profile later in life cannot be excluded.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d49","authors":["Janna W.
