Some advantages of water immersion are demonstrated, but others remain uncertain, and particularly, few studies have examined the financial impact of such a device on hospitals. This study simulated what could be the extra cost of water immersion for hospitals.\nClinical outcomes were drawn from the results of systematic reviews already published, and cost units were those used in the Quebec health network. A decision tree was used with microsimulations of representative laboring women. Sensitivity analyses were performed as regards analgesic use and labor duration.\nMicrosimulations indicated an extra cost between $166.41 and $274.76 (2014 Canadian dollars) for each laboring woman as regards the scenario considered. The average extra cost was $221.12 (95% confidence interval, 219.97-222.28).\nWhile water immersion allows better clinical outcomes, implementation and other costs are higher than the savings generated, which leads to a small extra cost to allow women to potentially have more relaxation and less pain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f33cf058f610002d91","authors":["Poder, Thomas G.","Poder, Thomas G"],"doi":"10.1111\/jep.12636","first_seen_on":"2016-09-08T10:01:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2753"],"journal":"Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice","last_mentioned_on":1473858998,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jep.12636\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/jep.12636"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jep.12636\/pdf","pmid":"27592846","pubdate":"2016-09-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"Water immersion during labor and birth: is there an extra cost for hospitals?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/water-immersion-during-labor-birth-extra-cost-hospitals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":19.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":19.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":458250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7921511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252909,"mean":12.486319887073,"rank":23437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":229450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252909,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":733,"mean":6.9304153005465,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":733,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":3.1473684210526,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Nursing and Health Professions":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":2,"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AETSA_\/statuses\/773823369238183936","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11894048],"posted_on":"2016-09-08T10:00:42+00:00","author":{"name":"AETSA","url":"http:\/\/www.aetsa.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/450360727912468480\/CzyPgjrt_normal.png","description":"\u2014\u2014Agencia de Evaluaci\u00f3n de Tecnolog\u00edas Sanitarias de Andaluc\u00eda\u2014\u2014 Ayudando a la toma de decisiones en salud","id_on_source":"AETSA_","tweeter_id":"720656903","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1292},"tweet_id":"773823369238183936"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PiCuida\/statuses\/773829429286039552","license":"gnip","rt":["AETSA_"],"citation_ids":[11894048],"posted_on":"2016-09-08T10:24:47+00:00","author":{"name":"PiCuida","url":"http:\/\/www.picuida.es","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/608015152953311232\/xWw1QDHT_normal.png","description":"Estrategia de Cuidados de Andaluc\u00eda. \u00bfConoces nuestra Red?
