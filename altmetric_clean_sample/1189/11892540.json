Insightful: Tonuk et al (2016) Medicine 95(35):e4660"],"citation":{"abstract":"To investigate the effects of physical agents on the levels of stress hormones in patients with osteoarthritis (OA).Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, hot packs, and therapeutic ultrasound were applied to the lumbar region and knees of patients with OA. Blood samples were taken for the measurement of the serum levels of glucose, insulin (INS), growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), cortisol (COR), and plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) immediately before and after the 1st session, to investigate the acute effects of those physical agents on the endocrine system. The hormone levels were also measured every 5 sessions in a total of 10 sessions. The treatment response was also evaluated by using the visual analogue scale (VAS), Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) throughout the therapy period.After the 1st session, there was a decrease in INS levels and a mild decrease in PRL levels (P\u200a=\u200a0.001 and P\u200a<\u200a0.05, respectively). Throughout the 10-session therapy period, the INS levels increased, whereas the ACTH and COR levels decreased (P\u200a<\u200a0.05 for all). The VAS-spine, RMDQ, VAS-knee, and WOMAC scores decreased (P\u200a=\u200a0.001 for VAS-spine and P\u200a<\u200a0.001 for all others). A positive correlation was detected between the changes in serum COR and WOMAC-pain score (P\u200a<\u200a0.05).Although the combination therapy caused changes in INS level accompanied with steady glucose levels, the application of physical agents did not adversely affect the hormone levels. The decrease in ACTH and COR levels may be attributed to the analgesic effect of agents and may be an indicator of patient comfort through a central action.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b27","authors":["T\u00f6n\u00fck, S\u00fckr\u00fc Burak","Serin, Erdinc","Ayhan, Fikriye Figen","Yorgancioglu, Zeynep Rezan"],"doi":"10.1097\/md.0000000000004660","first_seen_on":"2016-09-08T07:52:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-5964","0025-7974"],"issue":"35","journal":"Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1473403132,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/Abstract\/2016\/08300\/The_effects_of_physical_therapeutic_agents_on.48.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/2016\/08300\/The_effects_of_physical_therapeutic_agents_on.48.pdf","pmid":"27583888","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"e4660","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The effects of physical therapeutic agents on serum levels of stress hormones in patients with osteoarthritis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/Fulltext\/2016\/08300\/The_effects_of_physical_therapeutic_agents_on.48.aspx","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-physical-therapeutic-agents-serum-levels-stress-hormones-patients-osteoarthritis-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":1721640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6623579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252680,"mean":12.464756358858,"rank":68485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":183947,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252680,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4187,"mean":2.9531433349259,"rank":443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":3742,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4187,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":338,"mean":4.8698160237389,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":338,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":4},"mendeley":{"DK":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ElectroTim\/statuses\/773790919023788032","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11892540],"posted_on":"2016-09-08T07:51:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Tim Watson","url":"http:\/\/www.electrotherapy.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/666582602552369152\/3mSOhAqe_normal.jpg","description":"Professor of Physiotherapy, University of Hertfordshire.
