The prospective study included 93 patients with invasive breast cancer. The largest tumor diameters measured by B-mode US, B-mode US with CI, SE and 3-D US were compared in Bland-Altman plots versus pathology as reference. A general linear model repeated measures (GLM Rep) was applied to investigate factors influencing tumor sizing. All methods underestimated pathologic size, with SE (-0.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.7\u00a0mm) and 3-D US (-1.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.5\u00a0mm) having the smallest mean differences from pathology. Bland-Altman plots revealed that B-mode US, B-mode US with CI and 3-D US systematically underestimated large tumor sizes, and only SE was technically comparable to pathology. The study indicates that sonographic underestimation of tumor size occurs mainly in tumors >20\u00a0mm; in this subgroup, SE is superior to other ultrasound methods.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036d2","authors":["Stachs, Angrit","Pandjaitan, Alexander","Martin, Annett","Stubert, Johannes","Hartmann, Steffi","Gerber, Bernd","Glass, \u00c4nne"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ultrasmedbio.2016.06.026","first_seen_on":"2016-09-08T10:29:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-291X"],"journal":"Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1473330525,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27600473?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27600473","pubdate":"2016-09-08T22:10:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Accuracy of Tumor Sizing in Breast Cancer: A Comparison of Strain Elastography, 3-D Ultrasound and Conventional B-Mode Ultrasound with and without Compound Imaging.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/accuracy-tumor-sizing-breast-cancer-comparison-strain-elastography-3d-ultrasound-conventional-bmode"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8348788,"mean":7.0413328717018,"rank":7218012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8348788,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252659,"mean":12.463872214614,"rank":210802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252659,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":585,"mean":2.5611643835616,"rank":453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":585,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":0.90454545454545,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/773830425219248128","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11894690],"posted_on":"2016-09-08T10:28:45+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":716},"tweet_id":"773830425219248128"}]}}
