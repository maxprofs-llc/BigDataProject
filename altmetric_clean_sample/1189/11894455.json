Evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) has highlighted several potential novel loci. Here, the authors report the first GWAS of CP among a large community-based sample of Hispanics\/Latinos. The authors interrogated a quantitative trait of CP (mean interproximal clinical attachment level determined by full-mouth periodontal examinations) among 10,935 adult participants (mean age: 45 y, range: 18 to 76 y) from the Hispanic Community Health Study \/ Study of Latinos. Genotyping was done with a custom Illumina Omni2.5M array, and imputation to approximately 20 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms was based on the 1000 Genomes Project phase 1 reference panel. Analyses were based on linear mixed models adjusting for sex, age, study design features, ancestry, and kinship and employed a conventional P < 5 \u00d7 10(-8) statistical significance threshold. The authors identified a genome-wide significant association signal in the 1q42.2 locus (TSNAX-DISC1 noncoding RNA, lead single-nucleotide polymorphism: rs149133391, minor allele [C] frequency = 0.01, P = 7.9 \u00d7 10(-9)) and 4 more loci with suggestive evidence of association (P < 5 \u00d7 10(-6)): 1q22 (rs13373934), 5p15.33 (rs186066047), 6p22.3 (rs10456847), and 11p15.1 (rs75715012). We tested these loci for replication in independent samples of European-American (n = 4,402) and African-American (n = 908) participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. There was no replication among the European Americans; however, the TSNAX-DISC1 locus replicated in the African-American sample (rs149133391, minor allele frequency = 0.02, P = 9.1 \u00d7 10(-3)), while the 1q22 locus was directionally concordant and nominally significant (rs13373934, P = 4.0 \u00d7 10(-2)). This discovery GWAS of interproximal clinical attachment level-a measure of lifetime periodontal tissue destruction-was conducted in a large, community-based sample of Hispanic\/Latinos. It identified a genome-wide significant locus that was independently replicated in an African-American population. Identifying this genetic marker offers direction for interrogation in subsequent genomic and experimental studies of CP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f67","authors":["Sanders, A E","Sofer, T","Wong, Q","Kerr, K F","Agler, C","Shaffer, J R","Beck, J D","Offenbacher, S","Salazar, C R","North, K E","Marazita, M L","Laurie, C C","Singer, R H","Cai, J","Finlayson, T L","Divaris, K","A.E.
