High vaccine costs impede, however, implementation in endemic countries. To test single-dose vaccination as a possible alternative, we initiated an observational, longitudinal study in Nicaragua, to assess protective effectiveness and - through challenge vaccination - humoral immune memory response.\n\u2003Following a 2003 serosurvey, 130 originally seronegative children received 2005 one dose virosomal HAV vaccine, followed by yearly serological and clinical assessments until 2012. After 7.5 years, a vaccine booster was administered. Concurrent antibody screening of patients presenting with hepatitis symptoms documented persistent HAV circulation in the communities studied.\n\u2003Between serosurvey and vaccination, 25 children contracted hepatitis A subclinically (>8,000 mIU\/mL anti-HAV). In the remaining 105 children, immunisation resulted in 17-572 mIU\/mL anti-HAV. Under the \u226515% annual infection risk, an estimated 60% of children were exposed to HAV encounters during follow-up. No child presented with hepatitis symptomatology. Serological breakthrough infection (7106 mIU\/mL) was documented in one child, representing an estimated 98.3% (95%CI, 87.9-99.8) protective effectiveness. Boosting elicited an average 29.7-fold increase of anti-HAV levels.\n\u2003In children living in hyperendemic settings, one dose of virosomal HAV vaccine is sufficient to activate immune memory and may provide long-term protection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","authors":["Mayorga, Orlando","B\u00fchler, Silja","Jaeger, Veronika K","Bally, Seraina","Hatz, Christoph","Fr\u00f6sner, Gert","Protzer, Ulrike","Van Damme, Pierre","Egger, Matthias","Herzog, Christian","Orlando Mayorga","Silja B\u00fchler","Veronika K.
