Based on observations that individuals with Gilbert's syndrome (GS; UGT1A1(*)28 promoter mutation) are generally lighter, leaner and healthier than controls, specific inter-group differences in the AMPK pathway regulation were explored. Therefore, a case-control study involving 120 fasted, healthy, age- and gender matched subjects with\/without GS, was conducted. By utilising intra-cellular flow cytometry (next to assessing AMPK\u03b11 gene expression), levels of functioning proteins (phospho-AMPK \u03b11\/\u03b12, PgC 1 \u03b1, Ppar \u03b1 and \u03b3) were measured in PBMCs (peripheral blood mononucleated cells). In GS individuals, rates of phospho-AMPK \u03b11\/\u03b12, -Ppar \u03b1\/\u03b3 and of PgC 1\u03b1 were significantly higher, attesting to a boosted fasting response in this condition. In line with this finding, AMPK\u03b11 gene expression was equal between the groups, possibly stressing the post-translational importance of boosted fasting effects in GS. In reflection of an apparently improved health status, GS individuals had significantly lower BMI, glucose, insulin, C-peptide and triglyceride levels. Herewith, we propose a new theory to explain why individuals having GS are leaner and healthier, and are therefore less likely to contract metabolic diseases or die prematurely thereof.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["M\u00f6lzer, Christine","Wallner, Marlies","Kern, Carina","Tosevska, Anela","Schwarz, Ursula","Zadnikar, Rene","Doberer, Daniel","Marculescu, Rodrig","Wagner, Karl-Heinz"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep30051","first_seen_on":"2016-07-25T02:40:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1469414390,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27444220?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4956769","pmid":"27444220","pubdate":"2016-07-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetic linkage study","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Genetics research","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"30051","subjects":["science"],"title":"Features of an altered AMPK metabolic pathway in Gilbert\u2019s Syndrome, and its role in metabolic health","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/features-altered-ampk-metabolic-pathway-gilberts-syndrome-role-metabolic-health"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082038,"mean":6.8946982576228,"rank":6993707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082038,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257841,"mean":11.950643538628,"rank":218096,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257841,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33555,"mean":14.904648149252,"rank":28340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33555,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3244,"mean":16.156342275671,"rank":2728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3244,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
