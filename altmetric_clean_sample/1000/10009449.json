Long-term epidemiological effectiveness and cost-effectiveness were predicted by simulation of the model.\nCompared with the control group, strategies starting at 40, 45, 50 and 55 year-old had saved life-years of 629.51, 769.88, 738.98 and 533.21 years per 100 000 people, respectively, of which the strategy starting at 45 year-old saved the maximum life years. All strategies were cost-effective and starting at 40 year-old cost the most per life-year saved. Among all alternatives, strategies starting age at 45 year-old and 50 year-old were incremental cost-effective, and the incremental cost-effective ratios were 34 962.87 and 3 346.43 RMB per life year saved, respectively.\nThe strategy starting at 40 year-old implemented at present and other strategies were cost-effective in high-risk areas of rural China. However, the 45-year-old group is more aligned with the principle of cost-effectiveness. Considering the cost-effectiveness of different strategies and social economic status, 45 year-old is regarded as the optimal starting age of esophageal cancer once-in-a-lifetime endoscopic screening and is recommended in areas lacking health resources. The strategy of starting age at 40 year-old which could obtain better screening effects would be preferable in wealthy regions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd32","authors":["Feng, Hao","Song, Guohui","Yang, Juan","Hao, Changqing","Wang, Meng","Li, Bianyun","Zhao, Deli","Liu, Zhicai","Wei, Wenqiang","Qiao, Youlin"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-25T02:40:49+00:00","issns":["0253-3766"],"issue":"6","journal":"Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi Chinese journal of oncology","last_mentioned_on":1469414393,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26463155?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26463155","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"[Cost-effectiveness analysis of esophageal cancer once-in-a-lifetime endoscopic screening in high-risk areas of rural China].","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/costeffectiveness-analysis-esophageal-cancer-onceinalifetime-endoscopic-screening-highrisk-areas-rur"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082038,"mean":6.8946982576228,"rank":6993706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082038,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257842,"mean":11.95059815933,"rank":218095,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257842,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154,"mean":0.81111111111111,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.42647058823529,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
