The patients were divided into MWA group (n = 50) and resection group (n = 72), and the resection group was matched by MWA group based on clinical parameters. The survival and complications in the two groups were compared.\nThe overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 100.0%, 73.0% and 62.0%, respectively, in the MWA group, and 80.0%,56.0%, and 41.0%, respectively, in the resection group (P < 0.05). The corresponding recurrence-free survival rates were 88.0%, 63.0%, and 52.0% in the MWA group, and 68.0%, 45.0%, and 36.0%, respectively, in the resection group (P < 0.05). The multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that albumin level, performance status, treatment modality, and tumor size were independent prognostic factors.\nCompared with hepatectomy, percutaneous microwave ablation is a minimally invasive and reproducible procedure, and can improve the survival in patients with multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd32","authors":["Li, Sheng","Wang, Yiqi","Dong, Jun","Wu, Peihong"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-25T03:03:49+00:00","issns":["0253-3766"],"issue":"4","journal":"Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi Chinese journal of oncology","last_mentioned_on":1469415792,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26462897?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26462897","pubdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"[Comparison of the effectiveness of percutaneous microwave ablation versus hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma].","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-effectiveness-percutaneous-microwave-ablation-versus-hepatectomy-hepatocellular-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082038,"mean":6.8946982576228,"rank":6993656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082038,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257842,"mean":11.950547158908,"rank":218076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257842,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154,"mean":0.81111111111111,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.42647058823529,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/757410844846100484","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10009838],"posted_on":"2016-07-25T03:03:12+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"757410844846100484"}]}}
