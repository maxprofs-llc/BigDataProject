The PEI modified upconversion nanoparticles were prepared directly with a simple one-pot hydrothermal method, which provides high quality amino-group functionalized UCNPs with uniform morphology and strong upconversion luminescence. Two single-stranded DNA strands, which were partially complementary to each other, were then conjugated with NH2-UCNPs and Au NPs. When DNA conjugated NH2-UCNPs and Au NPs are mixed together, the hybridization between complementary DNA sequences on UCNPs and Au NPs will lead to the quenching of the upconversion luminescence due to the FRET process. Meanwhile, upon the addition of target DNA, Au NPs will leave the surface of the UCNPs and the upconversion luminescence can be restored because of the formation of the more stable double-stranded DNA on the UCNPs. The sensor we fabricated here for target DNA detection shows good sensitivity and high selectivity, which has the potential for clinical applications in the analysis of HBV and other DNA sequences.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002247","authors":["Zhu, Hao","Lu, Feng","Wu, Xing-Cai","Zhu, Jun-Jie"],"doi":"10.1039\/c5an01634g","endpage":"7628","first_seen_on":"2016-07-25T02:37:22+00:00","issns":["1364-5528","0003-2654"],"issue":"22","journal":"Analyst","last_mentioned_on":1469414225,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26421323?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26421323","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"7622","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"An upconversion fluorescent resonant energy transfer biosensor for hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA hybridization detection","type":"article","volume":"140","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/upconversion-fluorescent-resonant-energy-transfer-biosensor-hepatitis-b-virus-hbv-dna-hybridization-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082038,"mean":6.8946982576228,"rank":6993712,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082038,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257842,"mean":11.950604364705,"rank":218098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257842,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2078,"mean":2.9253933558016,"rank":1682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2078,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134,"mean":1.5646616541353,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
