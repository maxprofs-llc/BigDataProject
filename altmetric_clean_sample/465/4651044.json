Despite knowledge of time-dependent killing with \u00df-lactam antibiotics, most hospitals in Canada currently administer \u00df-lactam antibiotics by intermittent rather than extended infusions.\nTo determine clinical outcomes, microbiological outcomes, total hospital costs, and infection-related costs for patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia who received intermittent IV administration of antipseudomonal \u00df-lactam antibiotics in a tertiary care institution.\nFor this retrospective descriptive study, data were collected for patients who were admitted between March 1, 2005, and March 31, 2013, who had P. aeruginosa bacteremia during their admission, and who received at least 72 h of treatment with ceftazidime, meropenem, or piperacillin-tazobactam. Clinical and microbiological outcomes were determined, and total and infection-related hospital costs were calculated.\nA total of 103 patients were included in the analysis, of whom 79 (77%) experienced clinical cure. In addition, bacterial eradication was achieved in 41 (87%) of the 47 patients with evaluable data for this outcome. Twenty-eight (27%) of the 103 patients died within 30 days of discontinuation of antipseudomonal \u00df-lactam antibiotic therapy. The median total cost of the hospital stay was $121 718, and the median infection-related cost was $29 697.\nP. aeruginosa bacteremia is a clinically significant nosocomial infection that continues to cause considerable mortality and health care costs. To the authors' knowledge, no previous studies have calculated total and infection-related hospital costs for treatment of P. aeruginosa bacteremia with intermittent infusion of antipseudomonal \u00df-lactam antibiotics, with characterization of cost according to site of acquisition of the infection. This study may provide important baseline data for assessing the impact of implementing extended-infusion \u00df-lactam therapy, antimicrobial stewardship, and infection control strategies targeting P. aeruginosa infection in hospitalized patients.","authors":["Kwee, Francine","Walker, Sandra A N","Elligsen, Marion","Palmay, Lesley","Simor, Andrew","Daneman, Nick"],"first_seen_on":"2015-10-20T11:46:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1920-2903"],"issue":"5","journal":"The Canadian journal of hospital pharmacy","last_mentioned_on":1445379052,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26478584?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26478584?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26478584","pubdate":"2015-10-20T22:00:42+00:00","title":"Outcomes in Documented Pseudomonas aeruginosa Bacteremia Treated with Intermittent IV Infusion of Ceftazidime, Meropenem, or Piperacillin-Tazobactam: A Retrospective Study.","type":"article","volume":"68","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outcomes-documented-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-bacteremia-treated-intermittent-iv-infusion-ceftazidime-m"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
