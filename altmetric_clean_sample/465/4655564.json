Little is known about the correlates of new AP drug use following admission to long-term care (LTC) settings. This study investigated the frequency and correlates of new AP drug use among newly admitted LTC residents.\nThis longitudinal, retrospective study used data from the interRAI - Nursing Home Minimum Data Set version 2.0 (MDS 2.0) instrument. Data about demographic, clinical and social characteristics, and medication use, were collected in Ontario, Canada, from 2003-2011 by trained nurses. Residents with complete admission and 3-6 month follow-up data were included (N\u2009=\u200947,768). Multivariate logistic regression analyses, stratified by gender, explored correlates of new AP drug use upon admission to LTC.\nNew AP drug users comprised 7\u00a0% of the final cohort. Severe cognitive impairment, dementia, and motor agitation were significantly associated with new AP drug use among both sexes. Additionally, behavioural problems, conflicts with staff and reduced social engagement were strong correlates of new AP drug use.\nSocial factors were as strongly associated with new AP drug use after LTC admission as clinical factors. Strategies to prevent the potential misuse of AP drugs upon LTC admission should consider the social determinants of such prescribing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ba","authors":["Foebel, Andrea","Ballokova, Anna","Wellens, Nathalie Ih","Fialova, Daniela","Milisen, Koen","Liperoti, Rosa","Hirdes, John P"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12877-015-0127-8","first_seen_on":"2015-10-21T12:31:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2318"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Geriatrics","last_mentioned_on":1449146000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26482028","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2318\/15\/128"],"pmid":"26482028","pubdate":"2015-10-21T22:01:45+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Aging","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Geriatrics\/Gerontology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rehabilitation","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"A retrospective, longitudinal study of factors associated with new antipsychotic medication use among recently admitted long-term care residents","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retrospective-longitudinal-study-factors-associated-new-antipsychotic-medication-among-recently-admi-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6644977,"mean":6.1548448788946,"rank":2350665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4256589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6644977,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236071,"mean":9.3400290168169,"rank":78749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":155372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236071,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":700,"mean":6.2340572246066,"rank":363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":700,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":6.7404210526316,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
