The aim of this study was to identify the molecular mechanism underlying hypoxia-induced increases in invasive ability of human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs). Herein, we show that the expression levels of hypoxia-inducible factor l\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) and \u03b2-catenin were greater in ectopic endometriotic tissue compared with eutopic tissue from controls. Exposure of eutopic endometrial stromal cells under hypoxic conditions or treated with desferrioxamine (DFO, chemical hypoxia) resulted in a time-dependent increase in \u03b2-catenin expression and its dephosphorylation. Hypoxia\/HIF-1\u03b1 also activated the \u03b2-catenin\/T-cell factor (TCF) signaling pathway and the expression of target genes, vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase 9, and knockdown of HIF-1\u03b1 or \u03b2-catenin abrogated hypoxia-induced increases in HESC invasiveness. These results suggest that HIF-1\u03b1 interacting with \u03b2-catenin\/TCF signaling pathway, which is activated by hypoxia, may provide new insights into the etiology of endometriosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f61000345f","authors":["Xiong, Wenqian","Zhang, Ling","Xiong, Yao","Liu, Hengwei","Liu, Yi"],"doi":"10.1177\/1933719115607999","first_seen_on":"2015-10-21T22:46:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1933-7205"],"journal":"Reproductive Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1445467562,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26482209?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26482209","pubdate":"2015-10-22T22:02:36+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Hypoxia Promotes Invasion of Endometrial Stromal Cells via Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1\u03b1 Upregulation-Mediated \u03b2-Catenin Activation in Endometriosis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypoxia-promotes-invasion-endometrial-stromal-cells-via-hypoxiainducible-factor-1%CE%B1-upregulationmedia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6356958,"mean":5.9827593932131,"rank":5413325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6356958,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197213,"mean":10.347323479302,"rank":154839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197213,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":412,"mean":2.423795620438,"rank":255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":412,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":6.8776,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/656964691294482432","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4658487],"posted_on":"2015-10-21T22:46:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":409},"tweet_id":"656964691294482432"}]}}
