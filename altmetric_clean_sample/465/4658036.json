We describe the case of a 51year old male with persistent T1 glottic carcinoma. At initial diagnosis, he had been referred for curative radiotherapy as laryngeal access was not sufficient for TLS. For treatment of his recurrence, we describe the technique of performing a midline mandibular osteotomy to improve access to the larynx allowing for safe and effective transoral endoscopic laser microsurgery. Surgical access to the larynx was greatly improved, and we were able to perform TLS in a case that would have otherwise not been amenable to TLS. An intraoral midline mandibulotomy can improve access to the larynx and allow for successful transoral resection of laryngeal cancer in patients with otherwise inaccessible tumors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005712","authors":["Saini, Alok T","Parasher, Arjun K","Kass, Jason I","Altman, Kenneth W","Miles, Brett A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjoto.2015.10.005","first_seen_on":"2015-10-21T19:23:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0196-0709","1532-818X","01960709"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal of Otolaryngology","last_mentioned_on":1457944165,"links":["http:\/\/www.amjoto.com\/article\/S0196-0709(15)00215-X\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26954859?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.amjoto.com\/article\/S019607091500215X\/pdf","pmid":"26954859","pubdate":"2016-03-10T22:02:22+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Intraoral Midline Mandibulotomy Improves Laryngeal Access for Transoral Resection of Laryngeal Cancer","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intraoral-midline-mandibulotomy-improves-laryngeal-access-transoral-resection-laryngeal-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7391940,"mean":6.4229753378604,"rank":3359110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3867667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7391940,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239252,"mean":9.468894550075,"rank":102216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":128536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239252,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":410,"mean":1.8948166259169,"rank":103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":410,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.7368421052632,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/708084547305414657","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4658036],"posted_on":"2016-03-11T00:18:06+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"708084547305414657"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/discussionsclub\/statuses\/709295355062431745","license":"gnip","rt":["OTO_docs"],"citation_ids":[4658036],"posted_on":"2016-03-14T08:29:25+00:00","author":{"name":"let's discuss it!","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/637661013643386880\/DyIahhoq_normal.jpg","description":"If you tweet full copy of any our tweet (include text, link and hashtags) then we'll retweet you! #rt4copy #retweet4copy #retweetforcopy","id_on_source":"discussionsclub","tweeter_id":"311884997","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3187},"tweet_id":"709295355062431745"}]}}
