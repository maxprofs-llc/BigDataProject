Recessive mutations in COL25A1 are a recently reported cause, but the associated ophthalmic phenotypes have not been detailed. We highlight phenotypes of the 4 affected children from the 2 reported families: isolated congenital ptosis (one unilateral, one bilateral) and Duane syndrome (one unilateral, one bilateral) with synergistic divergence. Further study is needed to understand how frequently recessive COL25A1 mutations underlie these specific ocular phenotypes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b5b","authors":["Khan, Arif O","Al-Mesfer, Saleh"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jaapos.2015.04.011","first_seen_on":"2015-10-20T17:49:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["10918531","1528-3933"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of AAPOS (Journal of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus)","last_mentioned_on":1445363365,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1091853115005091&_version=1&md5=62e9f831906b6c1a3435fb1a9160aab3"],"pmid":"26486031","pubdate":"2015-10-22T22:01:07+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics","ophthalmology"],"title":"Recessive COL25A1 mutations cause isolated congenital ptosis or\u00a0exotropic Duane syndrome with synergistic divergence ","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recessive-col25a1-mutations-cause-isolated-congenital-ptosis-exotropic-duane-syndrome-synergistic-di"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6348733,"mean":5.9808086398984,"rank":5405073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6348733,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197700,"mean":10.343949509102,"rank":155152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197700,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":392,"mean":2.7609820971867,"rank":247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":392,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":2.80625,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eyecenterllc\/statuses\/656527653873303553","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4652820],"posted_on":"2015-10-20T17:49:25+00:00","author":{"name":"Eye Center","url":"http:\/\/eyecenterllc.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/355341300\/apple-touch-icon_normal.png","description":"Ophthalmologists - Eye Physicians and Surgeons.
