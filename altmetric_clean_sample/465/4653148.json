We recruited community-dwelling adults seeking treatment for \u2265monthly bowel leakage from specialty clinics within a VA medical center and university affiliate. An online versus paper version was evaluated at baseline, 2 weeks later, and 3 months after nonsurgical treatments per usual care. We assessed test-retest reliability (Pearson correlations) at 2 weeks, internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), and convergent validity (Pearson correlations). Sensitivity to change was the difference between the baseline and post-treatment (3-month) scores.\nMean age was 58.0\u2009\u00b1\u200911.9; 36% Veterans, 52% women. At baseline, 2 weeks, and 3 months, we found no differences in the online vs paper scores for the bowel control and quality of life domains. The ICIQ-B demonstrated fair internal consistency for the bowel pattern domain (Cronbach's \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.36-0.54). Internal consistency on the bowel pattern domain was better with the paper version than the online version at 2 weeks (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and 3 months (P\u2009<\u20090.01) with no difference at baseline. All other domains had good internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1\u2009>\u20090.80), good retest reliability (r\u2009\u2265\u20090.70, P\u2009<\u20090.001), domain-specific convergent validity for stool consistency (P\u2009<\u20090.05), incontinence severity (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.002), and quality of life impact (P\u2009<\u20090.05). After nonsurgical treatments, we found a reasonable response to change (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05).\nOnline and paper versions had robust psychometric data for use among U.S. men and women, including Veterans.
