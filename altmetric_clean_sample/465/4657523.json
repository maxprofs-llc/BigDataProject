However, studies on miR-29c function in heart development are scarce. We investigated the role of miR-29c in P19 cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation and the underlying mechanisms. We evaluated proliferation and cell cycle progression, detected morphological changes; apoptosis rate; BAX, BCL2, GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), and myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) expression; and caspase-3, -8, and -9 activity in miR-29c-overexpressing P19 cells, and investigated whether WNT4 was a miR-29c target. MiR-29c-overexpressing cells had decreased proliferation, increased G1 cells, and significantly higher apoptotic rate than the controls. Expression of the apoptosis-related BAX and BCL2 genes and caspase-3, -8, and -9 activity were significantly increased in miR-29c-overexpressing cells. Expression of the cardiac-specific markers GATA4, cTnT, and MEF2C revealed promoted differentiation in miR-29c-overexpressing cells compared to the controls. Luciferase assay confirmed that WNT4 is a miR-29c target. Wnt4 and \u03b2-catenin expression was decreased in miR-29c-overexpressing cells. MiR-29c inhibits P19 cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis and differentiation, possibly by suppressing Wnt4 signaling, whose deregulation contributes to congenital heart disease development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002932","authors":["Liu, Ming","Chen, Yumei","Song, Guixian","Chen, Bin","Wang, Lihua","Li, Xing","Kong, Xiangqing","Shen, Yahui","Qian, Lingmei"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gene.2015.10.038","first_seen_on":"2015-10-21T17:02:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0038"],"journal":"Gene","last_mentioned_on":1445446923,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26484393?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0378111915012469&_version=1&md5=b547ef513bd40d2129323c17d7f8cc08"],"pmid":"26484393","pubdate":"2015-10-21T22:00:45+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"MicroRNA-29c overexpression inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis and differentiation in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna29c-overexpression-inhibits-proliferation-promotes-apoptosis-differentiation-p19-embryonal-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6356958,"mean":5.9827593932131,"rank":5413309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6356958,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197213,"mean":10.347358213496,"rank":154834,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197213,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3927,"mean":2.4228843606724,"rank":3380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3927,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":1.6949666666667,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
