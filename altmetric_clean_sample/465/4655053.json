Given Ponticelli = std of care 2\/2"],"citation":{"abstract":"Patients with primary membranous nephropathy (MN) and persistent nephrotic syndrome have a high risk of progression to end-stage renal disease. The Ponticelli protocol (steroids with alkylating agents) is the most effective immunosuppressive therapy for this condition, but it has severe adverse effects. Tacrolimus and rituximab have demonstrated efficacy for remission of nephrotic syndrome in MN with a safer profile. However, the published evidence is largely based on small or short-term observational studies, historical cohorts, comparisons with conservative therapy or clinical trials without appropriate control groups, and there is no head-to-head comparison with the Ponticelli protocol.\nThe STARMEN randomized clinical trial will compare the efficacy of sequential tacrolimus-rituximab therapy with a modified Ponticelli protocol (steroids plus cyclophosphamide). The trial will also evaluate the role of antibodies against the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (anti-PLA2R) and other antibodies as markers of response to treatment and long-term prognosis.\nThe trial has already started with 23 patients having been enrolled as of 1 April 2015, an estimated 21.7% of the estimated sample.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa7ed3cf058f61000b622","authors":["Jorge Rojas-Rivera","Gema Fern\u00e1ndez-Ju\u00e1rez","Alberto Ortiz","Julia Hofstra","Loreto Gesualdo","Vladimir Tesar","Jack Wetzels","Alfons Segarra","Jesus Egido","Manuel Praga"],"doi":"10.1093\/ckj\/sfv075","endpage":"510","first_seen_on":"2015-10-21T11:58:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2048-8505","2048-8513"],"issue":"5","journal":"Clinical Kidney Journal","last_mentioned_on":1483020379,"links":["http:\/\/ckj.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/8\/5\/503.full.pdf%20html","http:\/\/m.ckj.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/8\/5\/503","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26413273\/","http:\/\/ckj.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/8\/5\/503","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4581392\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ckj.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/8\/5\/503.full.pdf","pmid":"26413273","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","startpage":"503","title":"A European multicentre and open-label controlled randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of Sequential treatment with TAcrolimus-Rituximab versus steroids plus cyclophosphamide in patients with primary MEmbranous Nephropathy: the STARMEN study.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/european-multicentre-openlabel-controlled-randomized-trial-evaluate-efficacy-sequential-treatment-ta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7953275,"mean":6.7183323059095,"rank":1678907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6217978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7953275,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242482,"mean":9.5630278248604,"rank":60992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":180623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242482,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":421,"mean":4.5695619047619,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":421,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":4.9695348837209,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Computer Science":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CKJsocial\/statuses\/656801685445197824","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4655053],"posted_on":"2015-10-21T11:58:19+00:00","author":{"name":"CKJsocial","url":"http:\/\/ckj.oxfordjournals.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/677421949929287681\/9LcVJFsp_normal.jpg","description":"Clinical Kidney Journal: Clinical Translational Nephrology, an official online only, open access journal of the @ERAEDTA, publishing bimonthly.
