HSFs, originally defined as classical transcription factors, strikingly appeared to play a central and often pioneering role in reshaping the epigenetic landscape. In this review, we describe how HSFs are able to sense the epigenetic environment, and review recent data that support their role as sculptors of the chromatin landscape through their complex interplay with chromatin remodellers, histone modifying enzymes and non-coding RNAs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e5c","authors":["Miozzo, Federico","Sab\u00e9ran-Djoneidi, D\u00e9lara","Mezger, Val\u00e9rie"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jmb.2015.10.007","first_seen_on":"2015-10-21T10:37:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1089-8638"],"journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1445464145,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26482101?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26482101","pubdate":"2015-10-21T22:01:43+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"HSFs, stress-sensors and sculptors of transcription compartments and epigenetic landscapes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hsfs-stress-sensors-sculptors-transcription-compartments-epigenetic-landscapes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6356958,"mean":5.9827593932131,"rank":4698898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":943851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6356958,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197213,"mean":10.347324493439,"rank":133933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":42375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197213,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3592,"mean":3.0235945419103,"rank":3148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3592,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":2.462037037037,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
