Response patterns were created and bivariate and multivariate analyses were applied to assess the possible determinants of overall public choice of plastic surgeons as experts in the plastic surgery-related scenarios.\nBoth \"plastic surgeons\" and \"plastic surgeons alone\" were the main response patterns (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in ten (83.3\u00a0%) aesthetic interventions-related scenarios. \"Plastic surgeons\" and \"plastic surgeons alone\" were significantly (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) more identified as experts in ten (47.6\u00a0%) and eight (38.1\u00a0%) general\/reconstructive-related scenarios, respectively. There were positive (health care professionals and prior plastic surgery interaction) and negative (\"high-familiarity\" viewers, \"high-influence\" viewers, \"high-confidence\" viewers, and \"high-similarity\" viewers) significant (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) determinants of response plastic surgeons in the bivariate and multivariate analyses.\nAesthetic surgery \"reality television\" viewing negatively influences the public perception of the broad scope of plastic surgery.\nThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.
