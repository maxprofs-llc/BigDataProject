To better preserve the intestinal graft viability and decrease ischemia-reperfusion injury, a device for extracorporeal perfusion was developed. We present the results for the first series of perfused human intestine with an intestinal perfusion unit (IPU).\nFive human intestines were procured for the protocol. (1) An experimental segment was perfused by the IPU delivering cold preservation solution to the vascular and luminal side continually at 4\u2009\u00baC for 8\u00a0h. (2) Control (jejunum and ileum) segments were preserved in static cold preservation. Tissue samples were obtained for histopathologic grading according to the Park\/Chiu scoring system (0\u2009=\u2009normal, 8\u2009=\u2009transmural infarction).\nJejunal experimental segments scored 2.2 with the Park\/Chiu system compared to the control segments, which averaged 3.2. Overall scoring for ileum experimental and control segments was equal with 1.6.\nThis data presents proof of concept that extracorporeal intestinal perfusion is feasible. The evidence shows that the IPU can preserve the viability of human intestine, and histopathologic evaluation of perfused intestine is favorable. Our early results can eventually lead to expanding the possibilities of intestinal preservation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db8","authors":["Armando Salim Mu\u00f1oz-Abraham","Roger Patr\u00f3n-Lozano","Raja R.
