After 5 or 6 days of plaque accumulation on the tip of the electrode, the subjects rinsed with a 15 ml 10% sucrose solution, followed by no subsequent rinsing or rinsing with either 15 ml of water, 0.25%, 0.50% or 1.00% urea solution, for 2 min. The plaque pH was continuously recorded for 120 min.\nWithout subsequent rinsing, the plaque pH decreased at 10 min to 4.39 and stayed below the critical pH of 5.7 for 80 min following a sucrose rinse. Subsequent water rinse showed little effects on the sucrose-induced decrease in plaque pH, whereas subsequent urea rinses all immediately and effectively neutralised sucrose-induced decrease in plaque pH, and remained above the critical pH of 5.7 until the end of data collection.\nUrea rinse could effectively counteract the pH fall following sucrose administration. These results strongly suggested that the regular use of low-concentration urea rinse after carbohydrate consumption may help prevent caries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008b15","authors":["Wang, Xiao Ling","Cheng, Chuo Yue","Ge, Chun Ling","Wang, Bing","Gan, Ye Hua"],"first_seen_on":"2015-10-21T11:26:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1462-6446"],"issue":"3","journal":"The Chinese Journal of Dental Research","last_mentioned_on":1445442085,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26485511"],"pmid":"26485511","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Urea Rinse effectively Neutralises Sucrose-induced Decrease in Plaque pH.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/urea-rinse-effectively-neutralises-sucroseinduced-decrease-plaque-ph"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6356958,"mean":5.9827593932131,"rank":2994440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1900239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6356958,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197214,"mean":10.347318422214,"rank":104657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":72360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197214,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.9,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"LV":1,"CL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sergiouribe\/statuses\/656793544376631296","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4654644],"posted_on":"2015-10-21T11:25:58+00:00","author":{"name":"Sergio Uribe","url":"http:\/\/sergiouri.be","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/484721046281412608\/xMDkYeVP_normal.jpeg","description":"Evidence Based Dentistry | PhD, MSc, DDS |  #PUQ | Skeptic | #Rstats | #Dentistry | #OralRadiology | Reinheitsgebot | Data science","id_on_source":"sergiouribe","tweeter_id":"72413277","geo":{"lt":56.946,"ln":24.10589,"country":"LV"},"followers":1417},"tweet_id":"656793544376631296"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cartesvelasquez\/statuses\/656857832013344768","license":"gnip","rt":["sergiouribe"],"citation_ids":[4654644],"posted_on":"2015-10-21T15:41:25+00:00","author":{"name":"Ricardo Cartes V","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Ricardo_Cartes_Velasquez","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1311934020\/Dr.Cartes.PhD_normal.JPG","description":"MD student.
