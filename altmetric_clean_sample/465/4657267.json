This is partially because of the absence of options in the management of maternal to neonatal transmission and the perceived low prevalence of HCV in pregnancy. Vertical transmission rates of HCV have been reported to be as high as 8%. Reducing maternal viremia may be beneficial given its role as a requirement for vertical transmission. Recent advances in HCV infection combination therapy have made high rates of sustained virologic response and HCV-RNA clearance in non-pregnant adults achievable. Currently, there are no therapies to prevent HCV vertical transmission. However, certain direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) may have substantially more favorable profiles in pregnancy in comparison to past medications. Given that maternal viremia has been linked to vertical neonatal transmission the use of DAAs may considerably lower HCV vertical transmission in pregnancy and warrants future studies.
