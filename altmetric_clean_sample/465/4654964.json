This study explored older families' perceptions of the future.\nSemi-structured interviews were conducted with nine older parents and three adults with intellectual disabilities and analysed to produce an explanatory thematic framework.\n'Tolerating uncertainty' was the major theme in participants' attempts to manage anxieties about the future, encompassing sub-themes of 'accepting the parenting role', 'facing challenges', 'being supported\/isolated', 'positive meaning making', 're-evaluating as time moves on' and 'managing future thinking'. Some participants expressed preferences for their future which were in contrast to their parents' views, and provide a unique perspective that has often been neglected in prior research.\nThis research has found commonalities in how families tolerate the uncertainty of the future, but also unique differences that require tailored interventions and prospective action by services.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002c9c","authors":["Pryce, Laura","Tweed, Alison","Hilton, Amanda","Priest, Helena M."],"doi":"10.1111\/jar.12221","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2015-10-21T11:54:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1468-3148"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities","last_mentioned_on":1481736512,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/jar.12221","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jar.12221\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jar.12221\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jar.12221\/pdf","pmid":"26487335","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Tolerating Uncertainty: Perceptions of the Future for Ageing Parent Carers and Their Adult Children with Intellectual Disabilities","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tolerating-uncertainty-perceptions-future-ageing-parent-carers-adult-children-intellectual-disabilit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.3,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8337162,"mean":7.0294654527998,"rank":1347386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6986387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8337162,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245858,"mean":9.6939105414935,"rank":49412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":196291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245858,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":461,"mean":4.581547826087,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":461,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":4.7690476190476,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":7,"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/656706560467427328","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4654964],"posted_on":"2015-10-21T05:40:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":981},"tweet_id":"656706560467427328"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/StaffsPsych\/statuses\/664759576915415041","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4654964],"posted_on":"2015-11-12T11:00:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Staffs Psychology","url":"http:\/\/www.staffs.ac.uk\/academic_depts\/pse\/psychology.jsp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/421204282956726272\/f1U3_FPb_normal.jpeg","description":"News, Events & Research (#StaffsPsyRes) from the Psychology Dept @StaffsUni.
