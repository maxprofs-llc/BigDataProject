Especially, mannanase has been a growing interest in industrial applications due to its importance in the bioconversion. In this study, an extracellular endo-\u03b2-1, 4-D-mannanase was produced by Streptomyces sp. CS147 (Mn147) and purified 8.5-fold with a 43.4% yield using Sephadex G-50 column. The characterization of Mn147 was performed, and the results were as follows: molecular weight of \u223c25 kDa with an optimum temperature of 50 \u00b0C and pH of 11.0. The effect of metal ion and various reagents on Mn147 was strongly activated by Ca(+2) but inhibited by Mg(+2) , Fe(+2) , hydrogen peroxide, EDTA and EGTA. Km and Vmax values of Mn147 were 0.13 mg\/mL and 294 \u03bcmol\/min mg, respectively, when different concentrations (3.1 to 50 mg\/mL) of locust bean gum galactomannan were used as substrate. In enzymatic hydrolysis of heterogeneous substrate (spent coffee grounds), Mn147 shows a similar conversion compared to commercial enzymes. In addition, lignocellulosic biomass can be hydrolyzed to oligosaccharides (reducing sugars), which can be further utilized for the production of biomaterials. These results showed that Mn147 is attractive in quest of potential bioindustrial applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006ca7","authors":["Yoo, Hah Young","Pradeep, G.
