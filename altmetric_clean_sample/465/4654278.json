The control group comprised 42 nonsmoking individuals.\nThe ages, refractions, and axial length measurements of the cases were recorded. Central macular thickness and choroidal thickness at the fovea and at 500 \u03bcm intervals from the foveal center in both temporal and nasal directions were measured using spectral domain optical coherence tomography.\nAlthough the smoking period of the smokers was mean 32.4 \u00b1 9 years (range: 20-60), the mean pack-years of cigarettes was 35.1 \u00b1 23.8 (range: 10-120). No significant difference was observed regarding refraction value and axial length between smokers and nonsmokers group. In addition, no significant difference was observed for central macular thickness and choroidal thickness values at 500, 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 \u03bcm nasal and temporal part of the fovea, between 2 groups.\nMacular and choroidal thicknesses in long-term smokers were observed to be similar to those of healthy individuals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6363cf058f610008765","authors":["Kantarci, Feride A","Tatar, Mehmet G","Colak, Hatice N","Uslu, Hasim","Yildirim, Aydin","Goker, Hasan","Gurler, Bulent","Karaca, Emine Esra"],"doi":"10.1097\/iae.0000000000000815","first_seen_on":"2015-10-21T11:03:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0275-004X","1539-2864"],"issue":"5","journal":"Retina","last_mentioned_on":1445418058,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/retinajournal\/9000\/00000\/A_PILOT_STUDY_OF_CHOROIDAL_THICKNESS_IN_LONG_TERM.97746.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/retinajournal\/9000\/00000\/A_PILOT_STUDY_OF_CHOROIDAL_THICKNESS_IN_LONG_TERM.97746.pdf","pmid":"27115859","pubdate":"2015-10-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"A PILOT STUDY OF CHOROIDAL THICKNESS IN LONG-TERM SMOKERS.","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pilot-study-choroidal-thickness-longterm-smokers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6356958,"mean":5.9827593932131,"rank":4698898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":943858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6356958,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197212,"mean":10.347420569847,"rank":133935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":42383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197212,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1254,"mean":1.1230486831604,"rank":564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1254,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":1.039837398374,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
