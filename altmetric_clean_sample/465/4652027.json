However, little is known about its ability to bioconvert polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from plant oils into long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs). In this study, special attention has been given to the fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) which is commonly described to be a rate-limiting enzyme of the LC-PUFA biosynthesis. This work reports on the cloning, tissue expression and functional characterization of the Eurasian perch fads2, but also on the cloning of two alternative splicing transcripts named fads2-AS1 and fads2-AS2. The fads2 cDNA cloned is composed of an open reading frame (ORF) of 1338 nucleotides (nt) and encodes a protein of 445 amino acids. This deduced amino acid sequence displays the typical structure of microsomal FADS2 including two transmembrane domains and a N-terminal cytochrome b5 domain with the \"HPGG\" motif. Quantitative real-time PCR assay of fads2, fads2-AS1and fads2-AS2 expressions revealed that the fads2 transcript was mainly expressed in liver and intestine and exhibited a typical gene expression pattern of freshwater species while fads2-AS1and fads2-AS2 genes were highly expressed in brain, followed by liver and intestine. Functional characterization of Eurasian perch FADS2 in transgenic yeast showed a fully functional \u03946 desaturation activity toward C18 PUFA substrates, without residual \u03945 and \u03948 desaturase activities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100025b4","authors":["Geay, F","Tinti, E","Mellery, J","Michaux, C","Larondelle, Y","Perp\u00e8te, E","Kestemont, P"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cbpb.2015.10.004","first_seen_on":"2015-10-20T14:15:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1107"],"journal":"Comparative Biochemistry & Physiology Part B","last_mentioned_on":1445350506,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26478265?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26478265","pubdate":"2015-10-20T22:00:50+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Cloning and functional characterization of \u22066 fatty acid desaturase (FADS2) in Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cloning-functional-characterization-%CE%B46-fatty-acid-desaturase-fads2-eurasian-perch-perca-fluviatilis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6348733,"mean":5.9808086398984,"rank":5405048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6348733,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197700,"mean":10.343957855123,"rank":155150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197700,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201,"mean":1.86462,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.428125,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
