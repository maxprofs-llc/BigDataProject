Some well-defined markers of undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are glycoconjugates, such as SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-81. However, Comprehensive GSL profiles of hiPSCs have not yet been elucidated. The global images of GSLs from the parental cells, hiPSCs, and differentiated cells revealed that there are parental cell-independent specific glycolipids, including Globo H (fucosyl-Gb5Cer) and H type1 antigen (fucosyl-Lc4Cer) that are novel markers for undifferentiated hiPSCs. Interestingly, undifferentiated hiPSCs expressed H type 1 antigen, specific for blood type O, regardless of the cells' genotypes. Thus, in this study, we defined the dynamics of GSL remodeling during reprogramming from parental cell sets to iPSC sets and thence to iPSC-neural cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Takuma Ojima","Eri Shibata","Shiho Saito","Masashi Toyoda","Hideki Nakajima","Mayu Yamazaki-Inoue","Yoshitaka Miyagawa","Nobutaka Kiyokawa","Jun-ichiro Fujimoto","Toshinori Sato","Akihiro Umezawa"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep14988","first_seen_on":"2015-10-21T23:05:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1471746228,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep14988","http:\/\/www.readcube.com\/articles\/10.1038\/srep14988"],"pmid":"26477663","pubdate":"2015-10-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Glycosides","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Induced pluripotent stem cells","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"14988","subjects":["science"],"title":"Glycolipid dynamics in generation and differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glycolipid-dynamics-generation-differentiation-induced-pluripotent-stem-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":950017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7255747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244451,"mean":9.7180034117406,"rank":38616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":205436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244451,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35327,"mean":14.789239200589,"rank":7343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":27952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35327,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2305,"mean":14.680118055556,"rank":480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":1822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2305,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
