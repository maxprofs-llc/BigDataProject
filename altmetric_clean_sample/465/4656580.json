In China, as one of the currently worst areas for antibiotics abuse, the annual prescription of antibiotics, including both clinical and veterinary treatment, has approaching 140 gram per person and been roughly estimated to be 10 times higher than that in the United Kingdom, which is considered to be a potential area for the emergence of \"Super Bugs\". Based on the integrons surveillance in Guangzhou, China in the past decade, this review thus aimed at summarizing the role of integrons in the perspective of both clinical setting and environment, with the focus on the occurrence and prevalence of class 1, 2 and 3 integrons.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000793","authors":["Yang Deng","Xuerui Bao","Lili Ji","Lei Chen","Junyan Liu","Jian Miao","Dingqiang Chen","Huawei Bian","Yanmei Li","Guangchao Yu"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12941-015-0100-6","first_seen_on":"2015-10-21T14:25:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-0711"],"issue":"1","journal":"Annals of Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobials","last_mentioned_on":1498462211,"links":["http:\/\/www.ann-clinmicrob.com\/content\/14\/1\/45","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26487554?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26487554?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/ann-clinmicrob.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12941-015-0100-6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ann-clinmicrob.com\/content\/pdf\/s12941-015-0100-6.pdf","pmid":"26487554","pubdate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"45","subjects":["microbiology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Resistance integrons: class 1, 2 and 3 integrons.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resistance-integrons-class-1-2-3-integrons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":3663535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4641109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246279,"mean":9.7027351448361,"rank":92254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":149446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246279,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275,"mean":3.6045693430657,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.8892857142857,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
