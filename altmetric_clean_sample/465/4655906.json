S100B, a suggested protein biomarker for cerebral injury, has been shown to correlate to extracranial injury as well. Using serum levels of S100B, we aimed to investigate how S100B could be used when assessing injuries in patients suffering from bicycle trauma injury. As a secondary aim, we investigated how hospital length of stay and injury severity score (ISS) were correlated to S100B levels.\nWe performed a retrospective, database study including all patients admitted for bicycle trauma to a level 1 trauma center over a four-year period with admission samples of S100B (n\u00a0=\u00a0127). Computerized tomography (CT) scans were reviewed and remaining data were collected from case records. Univariate- and multivariate regression analyses, linear regressions and comparative statistics (Mann-Whitney) were used where appropriate.\nBoth intra- and extracranial injuries were correlated with S100B levels. Stockholm CT score presented the best correlation of an intracranial parameter with S100B levels (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), while the presences of extremity injury, thoracic injury, and non-cervical spinal injury were also significantly correlated (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, respectively). A multivariate linear regression revealed that Stockholm CT score, non-cervical spinal injury, and abdominal injury all independently correlated with levels of S100B. Patients with a ISS\u00a0>\u00a015 had higher S100 levels than patients with ISS\u00a0<\u00a016 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Patients with extracranial, as well as intracranial- and extracranial injuries, had significantly higher levels of S100B than patients without injuries (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, respectively). The admission serum levels of S100B (log, \u00b5g\/L) were correlated with ISS (log) (r\u00a0=\u00a00.53) and length of stay (log, days) (r\u00a0=\u00a00.45).\nS100B levels were independently correlated with intracranial pathology, but also with the extent of extracranial injury. Length of stay and ISS were both correlated with the admission levels of S100B in bicycle trauma, suggesting S100B to be a good marker of aggregated injury severity. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007375","authors":["E. P. Thelin","E. Zibung","L. Riddez","C.
