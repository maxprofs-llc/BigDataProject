Of the 2362 surveys provided, 1374 were returned, resulting in a response rate of 58.2%. Only responders listing birthdays between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2007 were included in the analysis, resulting in 1165 qualifying responders. Asthma diagnosis was based on previous physician diagnosed asthma and\/or self-reported presence of wheeze in the past 12\u2005months (current wheeze). Severity of asthma, medication usage, environmental exposures, physician and emergency department visits were compared among respondents.\nThe prevalence of wheezing in the past year was 30.5\u00b11.8%, and of these 68.4% were previously diagnosed with asthma. Of the current wheeze participants, 39.9\u00b19.2% reported moderate to severe asthma symptoms and increased exposure to cigarette smoke, excessive dust, burning brush and landfills. Carriacou and Petite Martinique, the two smaller islands, had a lower incidence of current wheeze (14.1\u00b17.7%) and exposure rates to cigarette smoke and burning brush as compared to the larger, denser island of Grenada. Although 65.7% of respondents diagnosed with asthma reported taking medication, the number of annual doctor and emergency department visits were high (2.82 and 0.86, respectively). Respondents with the most severe asthma symptoms reported the most emergency department visits with an average of 1.05 visits annually, whereas respondents with moderate asthma symptoms had the most doctor visits with an average of 3.33 visits annually.\nThis study indicates that the prevalence of childhood asthma in Grenada is very high and warrants policy consideration in public health and education to decrease its morbidity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Thongkham, D","Tran, J","Clunes, M T","Brahim, F"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2015-008557","first_seen_on":"2015-10-21T10:40:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"10","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1470145113,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26482772?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/5\/10\/e008557.full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26482772?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26482772","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Prevalence and severity of asthmatic symptoms in Grenadian school children: the Grenada National Asthma Survey.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-severity-asthmatic-symptoms-grenadian-school-children-grenada-national-asthma-survey"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155605,"mean":6.9067370031636,"rank":1712868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6431695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155605,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243881,"mean":9.6988134492372,"rank":59328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":184072,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243881,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5920,"mean":16.91429565805,"rank":2619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5920,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":354,"mean":14.3128101983,"rank":154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":354,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Mathematics":1,"Environmental Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GD":4}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ACNPed\/statuses\/656775472307507200","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4653652],"posted_on":"2015-10-21T10:14:09+00:00","author":{"name":"ACNP","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1687251577\/logo_normal.png","description":"Asociaci\u00f3n Colombiana de Neumolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica","id_on_source":"ACNPed","tweeter_id":"434250807","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":157},"tweet_id":"656775472307507200"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nowgrenada\/statuses\/656793028976320512","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4653652],"posted_on":"2015-10-21T11:23:55+00:00","author":{"name":"nowgrenada.com","url":"http:\/\/www.nowgrenada.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000054477321\/3db825e707e5752676afd4c7050aeed7_normal.png","description":"Grenada News And Information Online\n\u2022 Telephone 1 473 444 2869   info@nowgrenada.com\n\u2022 http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/NowGrenada","id_on_source":"nowgrenada","tweeter_id":"1247105898","geo":{"lt":12.11667,"ln":-61.66667,"country":"GD"},"followers":2505},"tweet_id":"656793028976320512"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NewsofGrenada\/statuses\/656795076585234432","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4653652],"posted_on":"2015-10-21T11:32:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Grenada News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1605026253\/grenada_normal.jpg","description":"Comprehensive News of #Grenada #Caribbean","id_on_source":"NewsofGrenada","tweeter_id":"397583061","geo":{"lt":"12.1360374","ln":"-61.6904045","country":"GD"},"followers":4992},"tweet_id":"656795076585234432"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/asthma_papers\/statuses\/656797482970574848","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4653652],"posted_on":"2015-10-21T11:41:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Asthma Papers","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439482171208646656\/OWe4b0kE_normal.jpeg","description":"RSS feed for #asthma papers in #Pubmed.
