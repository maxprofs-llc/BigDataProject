A total of 20 ED triage nurses, 10 in each arm of the study, were recruited. The paper-based questionnaire contained nine simulated MCI vignettes. An expert panel arrived at consensuses on the wording of the vignettes and created a standard triage score from which to compare the study participants. Linear regression and chi-squared test were used to examine the time to triage and accuracy of triage, respectively.\nThe mean triage time for computerized CTAS (cCTAS) and START were 138 seconds\/patient and 33 seconds\/patient, respectively. The effect size due to triage method was 108 seconds\/patient (95% CI 83-134 seconds\/patient). The cumulative triage accuracy for the cCTAS and START tools were 70\/90 (77.8%) and 65\/90 (72.2%), respectively. The percent difference between cumulative triage was 6% (95% CI -19-8%).\nTriage nurses completed START triage 105 seconds\/patient faster when compared to cCTAS triage and a similar level of accuracy between the two methods was achieved. However, when the typing time is taken into consideration cCTAS took 45 seconds\/patient longer. The use of either CTAS or START in the ED during a MCI may be reasonable but choosing one method over another is not justified from this investigation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002534","authors":["Gwynn Curran-Sills","Jeffrey M.
