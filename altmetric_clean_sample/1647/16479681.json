Injury after MI by T1 rho CMR"],"citation":{"abstract":"The evolution of T1\u03c1 and of other endogenous contrast methods (T2, T1) in the first month after reperfused myocardial infarction (MI) is uncertain. We conducted a study of reperfused MI in pigs to serially monitor T1\u03c1, T2 and T1 relaxation, scar size and transmurality at 1 and 4\u00a0weeks post-MI.\nTen Yorkshire swine underwent 90\u00a0min of occlusion of the circumflex artery and reperfusion. T1\u03c1, T2 and native T1 maps and late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data were collected at 1\u00a0week (n\u2009=\u200910) and 4\u00a0weeks (n\u2009=\u20095). Semi-automatic FWHM (full width half maximum) thresholding was used to assess scar size and transmurality and compared to histology. Relaxation times and contrast-to-noise ratio were compared in healthy and remote myocardium at 1 and 4\u00a0weeks. Linear regression and Bland-Altman was performed to compare infarct size and transmurality.\nRelaxation time differences between infarcted and remote myocardial tissue were \u2206T1 (infarct-remote)\u2009=\u2009421.3\u2009\u00b1\u2009108.8 (1\u00a0week) and 480.0\u2009\u00b1\u200933.2\u00a0ms (4\u00a0week), \u2206T1\u03c1\u2009=\u200968.1\u2009\u00b1\u200911.6 and 74.3\u2009\u00b1\u200914.2, and \u2206T2\u2009=\u200951.0\u2009\u00b1\u200910.1 and 59.2\u2009\u00b1\u200911.4\u00a0ms. Contrast-to-noise ratio was CNRT1\u2009=\u20097.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5 (1\u00a0week) and 6.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4 (4\u00a0week), CNRT1\u03c1\u2009=\u200912.0\u2009\u00b1\u20096.2 and 12.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2, and CNRT2\u2009=\u20098.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.6 and 10.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8. Infarct size was not significantly different for T1\u03c1, T1 and T2 compared to LGE (p\u2009=\u20090.14) and significantly decreased from 1 to 4\u00a0weeks (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Individual infarct size changes were \u2206T1\u03c1\u2009=\u2009-3.8%, \u2206T1\u2009=\u2009-3.5% and \u2206LGE\u2009=\u2009-2.8% from 1 - 4\u00a0weeks, but there was no observed change in infarct size for T2 or histologically.\nT1\u03c1 was highly correlated with alterations left ventricle (LV) pathology at 1 and 4\u00a0weeks post-MI and therefore it may be a useful method endogenous contrast imaging of infarction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f90","authors":["Rutger H.
