Because no clinical and pathological studies had previously compared features of these diseases, we undertook this comparison with clinical and histological data.\nNine patients had IgG4-L (high levels of serum IgG4 and of IgG4(+) cells in lung specimens; typical extrapulmonary manifestations). Fifteen patients had iMCD-L (polyclonal yperimmunoglobulinemia, elevated serum interleukin-6 levels, and polylymphadenopathy with typical lymphadenopathic lesions). Mean values for age, serum haemoglobin levels, and IgG4\/IgG ratios were higher in the IgG4-L group, and C-reactive protein levels were higher in the iMCD-L group. All IgG4-RD lung lesions showed myxomatous granulation-like fibrosis (active fibrosis), with infiltration of lymphoplasmacytes and scattered eosinophils within the perilymphatic stromal area such as interlobular septa and pleura with obstructive vasculitis. All 15 lung lesions of iMCD, however, had marked accumulation of polyclonal lymphoplasmacytes in lesions with lymphoid follicles and dense fibrosis, mainly in the alveolar area adjacent to interlobular septa and pleura without obstructive vasculitis.\nAlthough both lesions had lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, lung lesions of IgG4-RD were characterized by active fibrosis with eosinophilic infiltration within the perilymphatic stromal area with obstructive vasculitis, whereas lung lesions of iMCD had lymphoplasmacyte proliferating lesions mainly in the alveolar area adjacent to the perilymphatic stromal area. These clinicopathological features may help differentiate the two diseases. This article is protected by copyright.
