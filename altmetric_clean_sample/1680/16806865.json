The results showed that MOx promoted the CO oxidation of Pt-Au\/CeO\u2082, but only the TiO\u2082 could enhance co-oxidation of CO and H\u2082 over Pt-Au\/CeO\u2082. Related characterizations were conducted to clarify the promoting effect of MOx. Temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen (H\u2082-TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results suggested that MOx could improve the charge transfer from Au sites to CeO\u2082, resulting in a high concentration of Ce(3+) and cationic Au species which benefits for the CO oxidation. In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (In-situ DRIFTS) results indicated that TiO\u2082 could facilitate the oxidation of H\u2082 over the Pt-Au\/TiO\u2082-CeO\u2082 catalyst.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Xiaowei Hong","Ye Sun","Tianle Zhu","Zhiming Liu"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules22030351","first_seen_on":"2017-02-27T12:23:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"3","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1488198185,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/3\/351?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/3\/351\/pdf","pmid":"28264456","pubdate":"2017-02-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Pt-Au\/MOx-CeO2 (M = Mn, Fe, Ti) Catalysts for the Co-Oxidation of CO and H2 at Room Temperature","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ptaumoxceo2-m-mn-fe-ti-catalysts-cooxidation-co-h2-room-temperature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":7162702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242396,"mean":13.659550659048,"rank":201877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242396,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3883,"mean":2.1573760947965,"rank":2642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3883,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":437,"mean":1.0693348623853,"rank":277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":437,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Chemistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/836189914316210177","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16806865],"posted_on":"2017-02-27T12:23:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/891043583511470080\/FfBKDjay_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
