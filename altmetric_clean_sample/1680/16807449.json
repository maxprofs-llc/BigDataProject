Knowing what basic conditions and opportunities in communities advance or impede improvement of community health can inform public health practice and policy. This article describes the methods for conducting systematic literature reviews of three community interventions to promote healthy social environments: early childhood development programs, programs to promote affordable family housing in safe neighborhoods, and interventions to increase the cultural and linguistic competence of healthcare systems. Existing methods, established for conducting systematic reviews for the Guide to Community Preventive Services, were applied to these interventions to promote healthy social environments.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002215","authors":["Laurie M Anderson","Jonathan E Fielding","Mindy T Fullilove","Susan C Scrimshaw","Vilma G Carande-Kulis"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0749-3797(02)00654-2","first_seen_on":"2017-02-27T13:00:41+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["07493797","0749-3797"],"issue":"3 Suppl","journal":"American Journal of Preventive Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1199145600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0749-3797(02)00654-2"],"pmid":"12668196","pubdate":"2003-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Methods for conducting systematic reviews of the evidence of effectiveness and economic efficiency of interventions to promote healthy social environments","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0749379702006542","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/methods-conducting-systematic-reviews-evidence-effectiveness-economic-efficiency-interventions-promo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8090406,"mean":6.8927529187899,"rank":1318779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6705251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8090406,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235665,"mean":13.758850414149,"rank":60149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":175177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235665,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2645,"mean":22.763963691377,"rank":1076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2645,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":69.42295049505,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
