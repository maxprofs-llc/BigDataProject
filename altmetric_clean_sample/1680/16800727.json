The inclusion criteria were (randomized) controlled clinical trials, participants \u226518\u00a0years and papers evaluating the effect of a TFTB compared to an ERTB. Data were extracted for dental plaque index (PI), bleeding scores (BS), gingival index scores (GI) and gingival abrasion scores (GA). A descriptive analysis and a meta-analysis were performed when appropriate.\nAn independent screening of 33 unique papers resulted in seven eligible publications, which included eight comparisons. Meta-analysis did not show a significant difference between TFTB and ERTB with respect to PI scores. The meta-analysis of the GI scores showed a significant mean difference in favour of the TFTB (DiffM=-0.12 [95% CI: -0.17; -0.07]). Of the three comparisons evaluating GA, no differences were found.\nWith respect to plaque removal, evidence that supports the recommendation for usage of a TFTB over an ERTB is lacking. Regarding GI, there is minimal evidence favouring a TFTB over an ERTB and the clinical relevance of this difference is probably negligible. Therefore, based on the collective evidence emerging from this systematic review, the strength and direction of the recommendation, there appears to be no firm evidence for a dental healthcare professional to advise the use of a TFTB over the use of an ERTB.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f61000599f","authors":["FCR Hoogteijling","NL Hennequin-Hoenderdos","GA Van der Weijden","DE Slot"],"doi":"10.1111\/idh.12272","first_seen_on":"2017-02-27T08:07:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["16015029"],"journal":"International Journal of Dental Hygiene","last_mentioned_on":1488175200,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28173609"],"pmid":"28173609","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"The effect of tapered toothbrush filaments compared to end-rounded filaments on dental plaque, gingivitis and gingival\u00a0abrasion: a systematic review and meta-analysis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/idh.12272","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-tapered-toothbrush-filaments-compared-endrounded-filaments-dental-plaque-gingivitis-gingival"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":1641641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6605483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242396,"mean":13.659535394707,"rank":68723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":173327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242396,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":309,"mean":5.0340844155844,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":309,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":3.5333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Toothbrushes: are tapered or end-rounded filaments best?","url":"https:\/\/www.nationalelfservice.net\/dentistry\/oral-health-other-health-conditions\/toothbrushes-tapered-end-rounded-filaments-best\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[16800727],"posted_on":"2017-02-27T06:00:00+00:00","summary":"This review of the effect of tapered or end-rounded filament toothbrushes on clinical parameters included just 5 RCTs providing inconclusive evidence to recommend one type over another. \nThe post Toothbrushes: are tapered or end-rounded filaments best? app","author":{"name":"The Dental Elf","url":"http:\/\/www.thedentalelf.net\/","description":"Keeping you up to date with reliable dental health research, policy &amp; guidance"}}]}}
