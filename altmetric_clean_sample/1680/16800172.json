Promising results have been obtained in the evaluation of renal perfusion in health and disease, both in human and veterinary medicine. Renal scintigraphy using 99mTc-Mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) is another non-invasive technique that can be used to evaluate renal perfusion. However, no data are available on the ability of CEUS or 99mTc- MAG3 scintigraphy to detect small changes in renal perfusion in cats. Therefore, both techniques were applied in a normal feline population to evaluate detection possibilities of perfusion changes by angiotensin II (AT II). Contrast-enhanced ultrasound using a bolus injection of commercially available contrast agent and renal scintigraphy using 99mTc-MAG3 were performed in 11 healthy cats after infusion of 0,9% NaCl (control) and AT II. Angiotensin II induced changes were noticed on several CEUS parameters. Mean peak enhancement, wash-in perfusion index and wash-out rate for the entire kidney decreased significantly after AT II infusion. Moreover, a tendency towards a lower wash-in area-under-the curve was present. Renal scintigraphy could not detect perfusion changes induced by AT II. This study shows that CEUS is able to detect changes in feline renal perfusion induced by AT II infusion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Emmelie Stock","Katrien Vanderperren","Tim Bosmans","Andr\u00e9 Dobbeleir","Luc Duchateau","Myriam Hesta","Lien Lybaert","Kathelijne Peremans","Eva Vandermeulen","Jimmy Saunders","Douglas Thamm","Stock, Emmelie","Vanderperren, Katrien","Bosmans, Tim","Dobbeleir, Andr\u00e9","Duchateau, Luc","Hesta, Myriam","Lybaert, Lien","Peremans, Kathelijne","Vandermeulen, Eva","Saunders, Jimmy"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0164488","first_seen_on":"2017-02-27T08:01:59+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-8115441","handles":["1854\/LU-8115441"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"10","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1497996057,"links":["https:\/\/biblio.ugent.be\/publication\/8115441","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0164488"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/biblio.ugent.be\/publication\/8115441\/file\/8115442.pdf","pmid":"27736928","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0164488","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Evaluation of Feline Renal Perfusion with Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasonography and Scintigraphy","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0164488","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-feline-renal-perfusion-contrastenhanced-ultrasonography-scintigraphy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":7258198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244619,"mean":13.713119868529,"rank":204715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244619,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115810,"mean":10.64496498545,"rank":97613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115810,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4389,"mean":11.559679124886,"rank":3651,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4389,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
