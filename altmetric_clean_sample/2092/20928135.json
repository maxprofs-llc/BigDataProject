While it is largely recognized as an effective treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the existence of non-learners has also been reported. The present study explored pre-training assessment indices that could predict learners prior to NF training.\nTwenty-two children with ADHD participated in slow cortical potential (SCP) NF training and completed pre- and post-training assessments. Participants were classified into learners or non-learners based on their progress in the SCP regulation, and pre-training indices that differentiate the two groups were examined by decision tree analysis.\nThe learner rate in NF training was 45.5%. Learners were predicted by pre-training cognitive and neurophysiological measures regarding Stroop tasks, which suggested relatively intact executive function as their characteristics. Given that NF training is not universally effective for children with ADHD, further studies are necessary to establish application criteria.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5233cf058f610003b80","authors":["Okumura, Yasuko","Kita, Yosuke","Omori, Mikimasa","Suzuki, Kota","Yasumura, Akira","Fukuda, Ayako","Inagaki, Masumi"],"doi":"10.1080\/17518423.2017.1326183","first_seen_on":"2017-06-09T12:42:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1751-8423","1751-8431"],"journal":"Developmental Neurorehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1497012108,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28594254?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28594254","pubdate":"2017-06-09T22:03:12+00:00","publisher":"Informa UK Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine","neurology","pediatrics"],"title":"Predictive factors of success in neurofeedback training for children with ADHD","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predictive-factors-success-neurofeedback-training-children-adhd-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":7212872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242112,"mean":12.571406313633,"rank":197480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242112,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211,"mean":3.7323714285714,"rank":188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":3.85,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":2,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IT":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/gag4all\/statuses\/873158186513178625","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20928135],"posted_on":"2017-06-09T12:41:48+00:00","author":{"name":"Andrea Gaggioli","url":"http:\/\/www.positivetechnology.it","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/851782358642688001\/RZltRHSH_normal.jpg","description":"Researcher.
