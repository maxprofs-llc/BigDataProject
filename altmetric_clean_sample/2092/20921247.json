This syndrome causes long-term metabolic issues as well as increase the risk of diabetes type 2, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. The current research aimed to study the effect of green tea on weight and hormonal changes of women suffering from PCOS.\nThis two group, double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted in Isfahan city. Overweight women suffering from PCOS (n = 60) were randomly divided into two groups. Green tea was prescribed to the experimental group, and placebo was prescribed to the control group. Free testosterone hormones and fasting insulin were compared in both groups at the beginning and 12 weeks after the study commencement. The weight of participants of both groups was also measured before and after the study. The statistical data were analyzed by SPSS software and paired t-test.\nThe paired t-test showed that there was no significant difference in the mean weight of both groups before the intervention (P = 0.812), but the difference was significant after the intervention (P = 0.031). There was no significant difference in the mean fasting insulin of both groups before the intervention (P = 0.352), but the difference was significant after the intervention (P < 0.0001). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the mean free testosterone level of both groups before the intervention (P = 0.638), but the difference was significant after the intervention (P < 0.0001).\nThe consumption of green tea by overweight and obese women suffering from PCOS leads to weight loss, a decrease in fasting insulin, and a decrease in the level of free testosterone.","altmetric_jid":"56e1a36e2a83eefd1f8b45bc","authors":["HatavGasemi Tehrani","Maryam Allahdadian","Farzane Zarre","Hanie Ranjbar","Fateme Allahdadian"],"doi":"10.4103\/jehp.jehp_67_15","first_seen_on":"2017-06-09T03:32:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2277-9531"],"journal":"Journal of Education and Health Promotion","last_mentioned_on":1496984493,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28584836"],"pmcid":"PMC5441188","pmid":"28584836","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Effect of green tea on metabolic and hormonal aspect of polycystic ovarian syndrome in overweight and obese women suffering from polycystic ovarian syndrome: A clinical trial","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-green-tea-metabolic-hormonal-aspect-polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-overweight-obese-women-suffer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":6331013,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1129847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242110,"mean":12.571590705013,"rank":171265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242110,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":2.720962962963,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HealthyFellow\/statuses\/873020007474647041","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20921247],"posted_on":"2017-06-09T03:32:44+00:00","author":{"name":"J P Fanton","url":"http:\/\/www.healthyfellow.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/480798063091392513\/5Zz0mSUG_normal.jpeg","description":"I'm an IIN Integrative Nutrition Health Coach, natural health consultant, researcher & writer.
