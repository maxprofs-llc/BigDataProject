Eighteen bulls were fed a total mixed ration based on maize silage and concentrate (40:60) and randomly allocated to one of three experimental diets: a basal diet with no urea (UC, 0%), a basal diet supplemented with low urea levels (UL, 0.8% dry matter (DM) basis), and a basal diet supplemented with high urea levels (UH, 2% DM basis). All treatments were iso-nitrogenous (14% crude protein, DM basis) and iso-metabolic energetic (ME\u00a0=\u00a011.3\u00a0MJ\/kg, DM basis). After a 12-week feeding trial, DNA was isolated from ruminal samples and used for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. For bacteria, the most abundant phyla were Firmicutes (44.47%) and Bacteroidetes (41.83%), and the dominant genera were Prevotella (13.17%), Succiniclasticum (4.24%), Butyrivibrio (2.36%), and Ruminococcus (1.93%). Urea supplementation had no effect on most phyla (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05), while there was a decreasing tendency in phylum TM7 with increasing urea levels (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0914). Compared to UC, UH had lower abundance of genera Butyrivibrio and Coprococcus (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0092 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.0222, respectively). For archaea, the most abundant phylum was Euryarchaeota (99.81% of the sequence reads), and the most abundant genus was Methanobrevibacter (90.87% of the sequence reads). UH increased the abundance of genus Methanobrevibacter and Methanobacterium (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0299 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.0007, respectively) and decreased the abundance of vadinCA11 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0151). These findings suggest that urea-supplemented diets were associated with a shift in archaeal biodiversity and changes in the bacterial community in the rumen.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022dc","authors":["Zhou, Zhenming","Meng, Qingxiang","Li, Shengli","Jiang, Lan","Wu, Hao"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00253-017-8323-4","first_seen_on":"2017-06-09T10:02:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0175-7598","1432-0614"],"journal":"Applied Microbiology & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1497004313,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28593336?dopt=Abstract&http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fentrez%2Feutils%2Ferss.cgi%3Frss_guid=12auu1PYsGCNpo6akauPh2r5KY5WDOs2B1hbPBXflIdOhD8YA8","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28593336?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28593336","pubdate":"2017-06-09T22:05:36+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology"],"title":"Effect of urea-supplemented diets on the ruminal bacterial and archaeal community composition of finishing bulls","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":6331014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1129858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242112,"mean":12.571439975879,"rank":171263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242112,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2178,"mean":2.1253752870923,"rank":1292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2178,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":3.1409565217391,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FeOM_Research\/statuses\/873117744958394368","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20925800],"posted_on":"2017-06-09T10:01:06+00:00","author":{"name":"FeOM Research","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/673283149602775041\/BEzKexFN_normal.jpg","description":"RSS bot that tweets from PubMed literature searches about iron-oxidizing microorganisms from the domains Bacteria and Archaea.
