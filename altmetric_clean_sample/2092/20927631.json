Two different seats (seat A, seat B) were used. Three repetitions per ATD and mounting seat were done, resulting in a total of 12 sled crashes. Dummy sensors measured the head tri-axial acceleration and angular rate and the thorax tri-axial acceleration; all acquired at 10,000\u00a0Hz. High-speed video camera recorded the impact at 1,000 frames per second. The 3D kinematics of the head and torso of the ATDs was captured using a high-speed motion capture system (1,000\u00a0Hz). A pair-matched statistical analysis compared the outcomes of the tests using the two different seats.\nStatistically significant differences in the kinematic response of the ATDs associated to the type of seat were observed. The maximum 3\u00a0ms peak of the resultant head acceleration was higher on seat A for the P3 dummy (54.5 \u00b1 1.9\u00a0g vs 44.2 \u00b1 0.5\u00a0g; p value = 0.012) and for the P6 dummy (56.0 \u00b1 0.8\u00a0g vs 51.7 \u00b1 1.2\u00a0g; p-value = 0.015). The peak belt force was higher on the seat A than on the seat B for the P3 dummy (5488.0 \u00b1 198.0\u00a0N vs 4160.6 \u00b1 63.6 N; p-value = 0.008) and for the P6 dummy (7014.0 \u00b1 271.0\u00a0N vs 5719.3 \u00b1 37.4\u00a0N, p-value = 0.015). The trajectory of the ATD head was different between the two seats in the sagittal, transverse and frontal planes.\nThe results suggest that the overall response of the booster-seated occupant exposed to the same impact conditions was different depending on the seat used regardless of the size of the ATD. The differences observed in the response of the occupants between the two seats can be attributed to the differences in cushion stiffness, seat pan geometry and the different belt geometry. However, these results were obtained for two particular seat models and a specific CRS and therefore, it cannot be directly extrapolated to the generality of vehicle seats and CRS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d63cf058f6100010df","authors":["Juste-Lorente, O","Maza, M","Lorente, A I","Lopez-Valdes, F J"],"doi":"10.1080\/15389588.2017.1334119","first_seen_on":"2017-06-09T12:08:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1538-9588","1538-957X"],"journal":"Traffic Injury Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1497010085,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28594247?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28594247","pubdate":"2017-06-09T22:03:13+00:00","publisher":"Informa UK Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Automotive Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Differences in the kinematics of booster-seated pediatric occupants using two different car seats","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":7212872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242112,"mean":12.57141498734,"rank":197480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242112,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":875,"mean":2.8745491990847,"rank":544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":875,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.7128205128205,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tomheston\/statuses\/873149701884747776","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20927631],"posted_on":"2017-06-09T12:08:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom Heston","url":"http:\/\/tomheston.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/452650157050302464\/-kGG7sgd_normal.png","description":"I help people make wise health decisions.
