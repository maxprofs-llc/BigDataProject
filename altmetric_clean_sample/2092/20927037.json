Overall mortality was the end point. Participants were divided into quartiles of %PRED, and mortality risk was estimated using a Cox regression model.\nDuring a median 8.2year follow-up, 167 all-cause deaths occurred. The Wasserman\/Hansen equation provided the highest prognostic value. Mortality rate was lower across increasing quartiles of %PRED. Compared to the first quartile, after adjustment for confounders, the mortality risk decreased for the second, third, and fourth quartiles, with HRs of 0.75 (95% CI 0.44-1.29, p=0.29), 0.67 (95% CI 0.38-1.18, p=0.17), and 0.37 (95% CI 0.10-0.78, p=0.009), respectively (p for trend <0.0001). Each 1% increase in %PRED conferred a 4% improvement in survival.\nThe percent-predicted VO2 peak determined by Wasserman\/Hansen equations applied to the 1k-TWT is inversely and significantly related to survival in cardiac outpatients. The 1k-TWT is a simple and useful tool for stratifying mortality risk in patients participating in secondary prevention programs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e39","authors":["Grazzi, Giovanni","Mazzoni, Gianni","Myers, Jonathan","Codec\u00e0, Luciano","Pasanisi, Giovanni","Mandini, Simona","Piepoli, Massimo","Volpato, Stefano","Conconi, Francesco","Chiaranda, Giorgio"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jsams.2017.06.003","first_seen_on":"2017-06-09T11:23:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1440-2440","14402440","1878-1861"],"journal":"Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport","last_mentioned_on":1497007338,"links":["http:\/\/www.jsams.org\/article\/S1440-2440(17)30450-4\/fulltext?rss=yes"],"pmid":"28645496","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Determining the best percent-predicted equation for estimated VO 2 peak by a 1-Km moderate perceptually-regulated treadmill walk to predict mortality in outpatients with cardiovascular disease","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/determining-best-percentpredicted-equation-estimated-vo2-peak-1km-moderate-perceptuallyregulated-tre"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":7212872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242112,"mean":12.571429237003,"rank":197480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242112,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1325,"mean":10.720397280967,"rank":1162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1325,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":11.165217391304,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Sports and Recreations":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BlackPhysicists\/statuses\/873138176306683904","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20927037],"posted_on":"2017-06-09T11:22:18+00:00","author":{"name":"BlackPhysicists","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/502208695854313472\/mupwPlOC_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"BlackPhysicists","tweeter_id":"46854930","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":16370},"tweet_id":"873138176306683904"}]}}
