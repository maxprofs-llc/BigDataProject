Methods: A total of 674 patients [(45.0\u00b113.7) years, men 341, women 333] admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2000 to 2015 were analyzed. Among them, 222 subjects were with essential hypertension (EH), 28 were with pheochromocytoma (PHEO), 246 were with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) and 178 were with aldosterone producing adenoma (APA). All patients received CCT. 24 h urine sodium was measured in partial patients. Plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (ALD) were detected. Results: Compared with EH [PRA: before 0.5(0.2, 0.9) \u03bcg\u00b7L(-1)\u00b7h(-1,) after 0.8(0.4, 1.5) \u03bcg\u00b7L(-1)\u00b7h(-1;) ALD: before (393\u00b1122) pmol\/L, after (360\u00b197) pmol\/L] and PHEO [PRA: before 0.3(0.1, 0.9) \u03bcg\u00b7L(-1)\u00b7h(-1,) after 0.4(0.1, 1.6) \u03bcg\u00b7L(-1)\u00b7h(-1;) ALD: before (396\u00b1108) pmol\/L, after (374\u00b1114) pmol\/L], lower levels of PRA and higher levels of ALD before and after CCT were observed in PA patients [PRA: before 0.1 (0.1, 0.2) \u03bcg\u00b7L(-1)\u00b7h(-1,) after 0.1 (0.1, 0.2) \u03bcg\u00b7L(-1)\u00b7h(-1;) ALD: before (468\u00b1216) pmol\/L; after (457\u00b1199) pmol\/L]. After CCT, the suppression rate of ALD [2.8% (-8.8%, 15.4%) vs 6.6% (-4.3%, 17.6%)] and increasing rate of PRA [0(0, 50%) vs 50%(0, 200%)] in PA patients were lower than those in EH patients. The ALD\/PRA ratio (ARR) were higher in PA than that in EH or PHEO patients. In the EH subjects, ALD levels of seated posture were higher than those of recumbent posture both before and after receiving captopril, but with no changes in ARR after CCT. No significant differences in ALD and ARR (before and after receiving captopril) were observed between seated and recumbent position in the PA group. The ARR after CCT tended to decrease in EH subjects with elevated urine-sodium compared with those with normal urine-sodium. No changes could be viewed in ALD and PRA levels between normal urine-sodium and elevated urine-sodium groups among APA, IHA and EH patients either before or after CCT. Among patients with APA, the ALD levels before CCT and the ARR after CCT were lower in the patients with Angiotension\u2161(Ang\u2161) reactive than those without. A ROC curve analysis suggested that the optimal cutoff value was 46.2 (ALD unit: ng\/dl; PRA unit: \u03bcg\u00b7L(-1)\u00b7h(-1)) for ARR after challenge in diagnosing PA, with the sensitivity of 88.7% and specificity of 84.8%. Conclusions: ARR after 25 mg captopril had high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of PA with the cutoff of 46.2. Seated CCT could replace recumbent CCT as a more confirmatory test. The PRA increasing rate should be taken into consideration when diagnosis of PA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9233cf058f61000da92","authors":["Chen, S","Zeng, Z P","Song, A L","Zhu, L","Lu, L","Tong, A L","Shi, C","Li, H Z"],"first_seen_on":"2017-06-09T10:19:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0578-1426"],"issue":"6","journal":"Zhonghua nei ke za zhi [Chinese journal of internal medicine]","last_mentioned_on":1504606336,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28592038?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28592038","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"[The application of captopril challenge test in the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism].","type":"article","volume":"56"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366342,"mean":7.0541652571821,"rank":7232210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366342,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243063,"mean":12.623328294838,"rank":198330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243063,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":1.024176,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.85714285714286,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NNTonthefly\/statuses\/873122277335814176","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20926199],"posted_on":"2017-06-09T10:19:07+00:00","author":{"name":"NNTonthefly","url":"https:\/\/bit.ly\/NNTonthefly","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/626661773383479296\/UtJrjxM3_normal.png","description":"A roBOT looking forward to NNT on Pubmed to knowledge translation\u2192 Un roBOT que rastrea valores NNT en Pubmed para transferencia del conocimiento.
