Taking inspiration from behaviour-based robotics and self-organisation principles, we present an interfacing mechanism, with the ability to adapt both towards the user and the robotic morphology. The aim is for a transparent mechanism connecting user and robot, allowing for a seamless integration of control signals and robot behaviours. Instead of the user adapting to the interface and control paradigm, the proposed architecture allows the user to shape the control motifs in their way of preference, moving away from the case where the user has to read and understand an operation manual, or it has to learn to operate a specific device. Starting from a tabula rasa basis, the architecture is able to identify control patterns (behaviours) for the given robotic morphology and successfully merge them with control signals from the user, regardless of the input device used. The structural components of the interface are presented and assessed both individually and as a whole. Inherent properties of the architecture are presented and explained. At the same time, emergent properties are presented and investigated. As a whole, this paradigm of control is found to highlight the potential for a change in the paradigm of robotic control, and a new level in the taxonomy of human in the loop systems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6123cf058f610006f39","authors":["Christos Melidis","Hiroyuki Iizuka","Davide Marocco"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10339-017-0818-5","first_seen_on":"2017-06-09T10:32:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1612-4782","1612-4790"],"journal":"Cognitive Processing","last_mentioned_on":1503196429,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10339-017-0818-5"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10339-017-0818-5.pdf","pmid":"28585090","pubdate":"2017-06-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Artificial Intelligence (incl.
