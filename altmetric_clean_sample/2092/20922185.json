In this work, the intramolecular isotope effect of the H2O(+) + HD reaction is investigated using a seven-dimensional initial state-selected time-dependent wave packet approach as well as a full-dimensional quasi-classical trajectory method on a full-dimensional ab initio global potential energy surface. The calculated branching ratios for the formation of H3O(+) and H2DO(+)via H- and D-transfer agree reasonably well with the experimental values. The preference to the formation of the H3O(+) product observed using the experiment at low collision energies is reproduced by theoretical calculations and explained by a one-dimensional effective potential model.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ee3","authors":["Hongwei Song","Anyang Li","Minghui Yang","Hua Guo"],"doi":"10.1039\/c7cp02889j","first_seen_on":"2017-06-09T05:23:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1463-9076","1463-9084"],"journal":"Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics (PCCP)","last_mentioned_on":1496985811,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2017\/CP\/C7CP02889J"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2017\/cp\/c7cp02889j","pmid":"28650041","pubdate":"2017-06-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Competition between the H- and D-atom transfer channels in the H2O+ + HD Reaction: Reduced-Dimensional Quantum and Quasi-Classical Studies","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/competition-between-h-datom-transfer-channels-h-sub2sub-o-supsup-hd-reaction-reduceddimensional-quan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":7212876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242112,"mean":12.571486029135,"rank":197480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242112,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4241,"mean":2.0772070754717,"rank":2893,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4241,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":413,"mean":1.0066359223301,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":413,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BlackPhysicists\/statuses\/873047885742358528","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20922185],"posted_on":"2017-06-09T05:23:31+00:00","author":{"name":"BlackPhysicists","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/502208695854313472\/mupwPlOC_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"BlackPhysicists","tweeter_id":"46854930","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":16370},"tweet_id":"873047885742358528"}]}}
