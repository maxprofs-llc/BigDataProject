Since no single factor responsible for the development of pancreatic cancer has been identified, it is believed that non-genotoxic factors may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this highly fatal form of cancer. Focal abnormalities of acinar cells, referred to as atypical acinar cell foci or nodules, occur spontaneously in rats and some other species. Their incidence increases with age from zero at birth to about 75% in 2-year-old rats. These spontaneous lesions have a phenotype that cannot be distinguished from the putative, atypical preneoplastic, acinar cell foci induced in rat pancreas by the carcinogen azaserine. Unsaturated fat (corn oil) has been found to increase the incidence of atypical acinar cell nodules and adenomas in the pancreas of non-carcinogen-treated rats without influencing the weight of the pancreas. Furthermore, unsaturated fat has a specific promoting effect on the growth potential of atypical acinar cell foci and nodules induced in rat pancreas by azaserine, resulting in an increase in the number and size of these lesions. Rats fed raw soya flour or trypsin inhibitors develop an enlarged pancreas as a result of hypertrophy and hyperplasia. They also develop acidophilic atypical acinar cell foci and nodules, adenomas and adenocarcinomas after being fed full-fat raw soya flour for 2 years. It may be concluded from the observations in rat pancreas that non-genotoxic compounds or conditions that enhance pancreatic growth may be classified as non-genotoxic pancreatic tumour promoters. The observations with corn oil, however, indicate that there may be non-genotoxic compounds that specifically enhance growth of spontaneous initiated atypical acinar cell foci without causing hyperplasia of the pancreas. The possible mechanisms whereby unsaturated fat and trypsin inhibitors exert their effects on exocrine pancreatic carcinogenesis are discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000821b","authors":["Woutersen, R A","van Garderen-Hoetmer, A","Lamers, C B","Scherer, E"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-26T22:06:51+00:00","issns":["0027-5107"],"issue":"2","journal":"Mutation Research\/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis","last_mentioned_on":1505685660,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2046686"],"pmid":"2046686","pubdate":"1991-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Early indicators of exocrine pancreas carcinogenesis produced by non-genotoxic agents.","type":"article","volume":"248"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425903,"mean":7.0877584607476,"rank":6393273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1145136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425903,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222269,"mean":12.893390816492,"rank":158561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":39603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222269,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1484,"mean":4.0287700606878,"rank":1305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1484,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.85,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/beachvetlbc\/statuses\/909537700990070784","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22570844],"posted_on":"2017-09-17T22:01:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Notorious KGB Aggie","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/beachvetlbc","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/721053199126278144\/NKr8h9uB_normal.jpg","description":"#GMOs Wonkette #journalism watchdog. #UCDavis alumnus  Preventive Veterinary #Medicine  #Agriculture Health #politics #geopolitics Humor","id_on_source":"beachvetlbc","tweeter_id":"1194957349","geo":{"lt":33.76696,"ln":-118.18923,"country":"US"},"followers":2856},"tweet_id":"909537700990070784"}]}}
