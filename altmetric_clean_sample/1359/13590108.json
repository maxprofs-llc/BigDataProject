Burn severity was determined according to total body surface area (TBSA) percentage and degree. Patients were followed up for one year. Multivariate analyses were carried out to determine the factors (burn etiology, time and place of injury, living conditions, hospital type, first-aid treatment methods, and parent\/guardian knowledge of burns, educational level, occupation) affecting burn properties (severity and pigmentation\/scar).\n191\/400 (47.8 %) patients were aged 2-3 years, and scalding was the leading etiology (355\/400, 88.8 %). Burn incidence peaked in May (14.8 %), at 10:00-12:00 and 17:00-20:00. Most burn events occurred indoors (272\/400, 68.0 %), especially in the kitchen (180\/400, 45.0 %). Roughly half of them involved head and neck; 188 (47.0 %) patients had mild burns, 140 (35.0 %) moderate, 44 (11.0 %) extensive, and 28 (7.0 %) critical burns; 184 (46.0 %) patients were treated only with cold-water rinsing or compress; 120 (30.0 %) received no first aid. Only 32 (8.0 %) patients visited a specialized institution. 164 patients underwent surgery. Hospitalization lasted for 14.8\u2009\u00b1\u20098.1 days. Independent risk factors for burn severity were occurrence month, living conditions, occupation of the mother, and first aid. 288 (72.0 %) patients developed pigmentation and scar within a year while no independent risk factors was observed.\nPediatric burns often occurred indoors, especially in the kitchen, and a substantial proportion receives no first aid.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b3","authors":["Shujun Wang","Shujun Wang","Dawei Li","Chuanan Shen","Jiake Chai","Hongjuan Zhu","Yanlu Lin","Congying Liu"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12887-016-0686-7","first_seen_on":"2016-11-14T13:11:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2431"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1479054526,"links":["http:\/\/bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12887-016-0686-7"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12887-016-0686-7?site=bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"27756257","pubdate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"166","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Epidemiology of burns in pediatric patients of Beijing City","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epidemiology-burns-pediatric-patients-beijing-city"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7690302,"mean":6.5973724521265,"rank":6653317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7690302,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228101,"mean":12.906914256905,"rank":184572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228101,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1045,"mean":4.9468850574713,"rank":908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1045,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":4.9937142857143,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
