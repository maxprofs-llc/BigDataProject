An extended-release (XR) formulation has been designed to provide a once-daily (QD) dosing option to patients to achieve comparable pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters to the twice-daily immediate-release (IR) formulation. We conducted two randomized, open-label, Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers. Study\u00a0A characterized single-dose and steady-state PK of tofacitinib XR 11 mg QD and intended to demonstrate equivalence of exposure under single-dose and steady-state conditions to tofacitinib IR 5\u00a0mg twice daily. Study B assessed the effect of a high fat meal on the bioavailability of tofacitinib from the XR formulation. Safety and tolerability were monitored in both studies. In Study A (N = 24), the XR and IR formulations achieved time to maximum plasma concentration at 4 hours and 0.5 hours post-dose, respectively; terminal half-life was 5.9\u00a0hours and 3.2\u00a0hours, respectively. Area under plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ) after single- and multiple-dose administration were equivalent between the XR and IR formulations. In Study B (N = 24), no difference in AUC was observed for fed vs fasted conditions. Cmax increased by 27% under fed state. Upon repeat administration, negligible accumulation (<20%) of systemic exposures was observed for both formulations. Steady state was achieved within 48 hours of dosing with the XR formulation. Tofacitinib administration as an XR or IR formulation was generally well tolerated in these studies. This article is protected by copyright.
