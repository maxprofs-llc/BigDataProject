This survival benefit of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in reducing HIV related deaths has been well studied in the developed world. In resource-poor settings, where such treatment was started recently, there is inadequate information about impact of ART on the survival of patients especially in children. So, this study aims to investigate predictors of mortality of children on ART. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify predictors of mortality among children on HAART.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d8","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2458-13-1047","first_seen_on":"2013-11-06T12:24:19+00:00","issns":["1471-2458"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1392361982,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/13\/1047\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/13\/1047"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2458-13-1047.pdf","pmid":"24517533","pubdate":"2013-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1047","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Predictors of mortality among HIV infected children on anti-retroviral therapy in Mekelle Hospital, Northern Ethiopia: a retrospective cohort study","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predictors-mortality-among-hiv-infected-children-antiretroviral-therapy-mekelle-hospital-northern-et-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230816,"mean":5.9681227261619,"rank":1008051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5219892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230816,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116208,"mean":7.9446678255184,"rank":22731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":93404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116208,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6108,"mean":7.6968819387588,"rank":1635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":4468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6108,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283,"mean":8.7835390070922,"rank":103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
