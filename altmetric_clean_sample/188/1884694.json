Measurements were performed in a flow cell providing excellent baseline stability and fast recovery of the sensor. Improved design of the polymer matrix resulted in a lower detection limit of 200 pmol\/l for adrenaline. The sensor has successfully been applied to the analysis of adrenaline in effluate of isolated rabbit hearts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f7","authors":["J Szeponik","B M\u00f6ller","D Pfeiffer","F Lisdat","U Wollenberger","A Makower","F W Scheller"],"first_seen_on":"2013-11-05T18:15:25+00:00","issns":["0956-5663"],"issue":"9-10","journal":"Biosensors & Bioelectronics","last_mentioned_on":1383675285,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9451785"],"pmid":"9451785","pubdate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Science Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Ultrasensitive bienzyme sensor for adrenaline.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultrasensitive-bienzyme-sensor-adrenaline"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631090,"mean":4.9276517821564,"rank":2015390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":943247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631090,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97641,"mean":7.7169548136013,"rank":50544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":26276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97641,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":783,"mean":2.5078593350384,"rank":426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":783,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":1.7142857142857,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
