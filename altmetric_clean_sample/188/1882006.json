Further elaboration of the contribution of the surface PEGylation pattern to biodistribution is highly desirable. We fabricated a series of polyion complex (PIC) micelles PEGylated with different ratios (PEG2k and PEG550). The plasma protein adsorption, murine macrophage uptake, and in vivo biodistribution with iodine-125 as the tracer were systematically studied to elucidate the impact of PEGylation patterns on the biodistribution of micelles. We demonstrated that the PEGylated micelles with short hydrophilic PEG chains mixed on the surface were cleared quickly by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), and the single PEG2k PEGylated micelles could efficiently prolong the blood circulation time and increase their deposition in tumor sites. The present study extends the understanding of the PEGylation strategy to further advance the development of ideal nanocarriers for drug delivery and imaging applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007966","authors":["Jianfeng Liu","Hongjun Gao","cuihong yang","liping chu","Tangjian Cheng","jinjian liu","Hongyan Xu","Saijun Fan","Linqi Shi","Aimin Meng"],"doi":"10.2147\/ijn.s51566","first_seen_on":"2013-11-04T22:27:50+00:00","issns":["1178-2013"],"journal":"International Journal of Nanomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1383605364,"links":["http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/the-impact-of-pegylation-patterns-on-the-in-vivo-biodistribution-of-mi-peer-reviewed-article-IJN"],"pmid":"24235825","pubdate":"2013-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"4229","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"The impact of PEGylation patterns on the in vivo biodistribution of mixed shell micelles","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-pegylation-patterns-vivo-biodistribution-mixed-shell-micelles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2124045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2228086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103563,"mean":7.8354804658081,"rank":46239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":53015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103563,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1146,"mean":1.8409082969432,"rank":433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1146,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":3.2444166666667,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
