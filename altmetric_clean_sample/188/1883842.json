Three-dimensional chondrogenic differentiation was induced in an alginate matrix, which served to immobilize and potentially protect MSCs at the site of implantation. We show that allogeneic differentiated MSCs lost the ability to inhibit T-cell proliferation in vitro, in association with reduced nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 secretion. Differentiation altered immunogenicity as evidenced by induced proliferation of allogeneic T cells and increased susceptibility to cytotoxic lysis by allo-specific T cells. Undifferentiated or differentiated allo-MSCs were implanted subcutaneously, with and without alginate encapsulation. Increased CD3(+) and CD68(+) infiltration was evident in differentiated and splenocyte encapsulated implants only. Without encapsulation, increased local memory T-cell responses were detectable in recipients of undifferentiated and differentiated MSCs; however, only differentiated MSCs induced systemic memory T-cell responses. In recipients of encapsulated allogeneic cells, only differentiated allo-MSCs induced memory T-cell responses locally and systemically. Systemic alloimmune responses to differentiated MSCs indicate immunogenicity regardless of alginate encapsulation and may require immunosuppressive therapy for therapeutic use.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000311d","authors":["Aideen E Ryan","Paul Lohan","Lisa O|[rsquo]|Flynn","Oliver Treacy","Xizhe Chen","Cynthia Coleman","Georgina Shaw","Mary Murphy","Frank Barry","Matthew D Griffin","Thomas Ritter"],"doi":"10.1038\/mt.2013.261","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-11-05T12:25:55+00:00","issns":["1525-0016","1525-0024"],"journal":"Molecular Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1385175420,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/mt\/journal\/vaop\/naam\/pdf\/mt2013261a.pdf","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24184966"],"pmid":"24184966","pubdate":"2013-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Chondrogenic differentiation increases anti-donor immune response to allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chondrogenic-differentiation-increases-antidonor-immune-response-allogeneic-mesenchymal-stem-cell-tr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.38,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.38},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":609306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":4427456,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109813,"mean":7.9395734710234,"rank":15461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":94351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109813,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":975,"mean":6.4944004106776,"rank":268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":975,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":7.0169696969697,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
