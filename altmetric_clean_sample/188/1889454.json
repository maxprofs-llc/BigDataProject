Presenilin (PS) 1 or 2 is the catalytic component of the \u03b3-secretase complex. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an established phenomenon in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the causes and role of PS1, APP, and APP's cleavage products in this process are largely unknown. We studied the effect of these AD-associated molecules on mitochondrial features. Using cells deficient in PSs expression, expressing human wild-type PS1, or PS1 familial AD (FAD) mutants, we found that PS1 affects mitochondrial energy metabolism (ATP levels and oxygen consumption) and expression of mitochondrial proteins. These effects were associated with enhanced expression of the mitochondrial master transcriptional coactivator PGC-1\u03b1 and its target genes. Importantly, PS1-FAD mutations decreased PS1's ability to enhance PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA levels. Analyzing the effect of APP and its \u03b3-secretase-derived cleavage products A\u03b2 and AICD on PGC-1\u03b1 expression showed that APP and AICD increase PGC-1\u03b1 expression. Accordingly, PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA levels in cells deficient in APP\/APLP2 or expressing APP lacking its last 15 amino acids were lower than in control cells, and treatment with AICD, but not with A\u03b2, enhanced PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA levels in these and PSs-deficient cells. In addition, knockdown of the AICD-binding partner Fe65 reduced PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA levels. Importantly, APP\/AICD increases PGC-1\u03b1 expression also in the mice brain. Our results therefore suggest that APP processing regulates mitochondrial function and that impairments in the newly discovered PS1\/APP\/AICD\/PGC-1\u03b1 pathway may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ad","authors":["Robinson, Ari","Gr\u00f6sgen, Sven","Mett, Janine","Zimmer, Valerie C.","Haupenthal, Viola J.","Hundsd\u00f6rfer, Benjamin","P.
