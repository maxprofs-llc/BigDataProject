At the same time, there is increasing focus on road safety research and policy development in the context of globalisation, sustainability, liveability and health. This special section presents a selection of papers that were presented at the annual ICTCT workshop held on the 8th and 9th of November 2012 in Hasselt, Belgium, and accepted for publication in Accident Analysis and Prevention following the journal's reviewing procedure. The aim of the ICTCT workshop was to analyse road safety facts, data and visions for the future in the wider context of current issues and future challenges in road safety.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000213e","authors":["Stijn Daniels","Ralf Risser"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aap.2013.10.004","first_seen_on":"2013-11-06T03:30:48+00:00","issns":["1879-2057"],"journal":"Accident Analysis & Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1383708606,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24182518?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24182518","pubdate":"2013-10-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Transportation And Freight Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Road safety in a globalised and more sustainable world: Current issues and future challenges.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/road-safety-globalised-more-sustainable-world-current-issues-future-challenges-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627150,"mean":4.9502167410311,"rank":2906656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627150,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97546,"mean":7.7546553693169,"rank":77393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97546,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1124,"mean":3.8717168299199,"rank":636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1124,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":5.3135844155844,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BA":1},"mendeley":{"ID":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tomheston\/status\/397928854573965312","license":"public","citation_ids":[1885846],"posted_on":"2013-11-06T03:30:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom Heston","url":"http:\/\/tomheston.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/452650157050302464\/-kGG7sgd_normal.png","description":"I help people make wise health decisions.
