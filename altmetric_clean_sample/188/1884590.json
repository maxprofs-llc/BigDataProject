In our institution all patients who were admitted with an intracapsular hip fracture and were suitable for a hemi-arthroplasty between April 2010 and July 2012 received an uncemented prosthesis according to our established departmental routine practice. A retrospective analysis of outcome was performed to establish whether the continued use of an uncemented stem was justified. Patient, surgical and outcome data were collected on the National Hip Fracture database. A total of 306 patients received a Cathcart modular head on a Corail uncemented stem as a hemi-arthroplasty. The mean age of the patients was 83.3 years (SD 7.56; 46.6 to 94) and 216 (70.6%) were women. The mortality rate at 30 days was 5.8%. A total of 46.5% of patients returned to their own home by 30 days, which increased to 73.2% by 120 days. The implant used as a hemi-arthroplasty for intracapsular hip fracture provided satisfactory results, with a good rate of return to pre-injury place of residence and an acceptable mortality rate. Surgery should be performed by those who are familiar with the design of the stem and understand what is required for successful implantation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059fd","authors":["B.
