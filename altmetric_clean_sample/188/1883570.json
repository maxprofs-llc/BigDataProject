Get tested for Celiac Disease."],"citation":{"abstract":"Celiac disease is a well-known entity in pediatrics and pediatric gastroenterology that is now also frequently encountered in the adult population. Apart from typical symptoms, celiac disease can present with a wide range of manifestations that are sometimes atypical, scarce or purely extraintestinal. Serologic and genetic testing are useful tools in case of low clinical probability in the early diagnostic algorithm. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy remains the mainstay to confirm the diagnosis especially in atypical clinical presentations. Complications are rare but can be severe. Although gluten-free diet often leads to complete recovery, compliance is not universal and alternative treatment strategies are under investigation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd1b","authors":["S Godat","D Velin","V Aubert","A Nydegger","A M Schoepfer","M H Maillard"],"first_seen_on":"2013-11-05T11:02:30+00:00","issns":["1660-9379"],"issue":"396","journal":"Revue m\u00e9dicale suisse","last_mentioned_on":1386320225,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24066466?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24066466"],"pmid":"24066466","pubdate":"2013-09-04T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[An update on celiac disease].","type":"article","volume":"9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":2494167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2389900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109838,"mean":7.9379131804404,"rank":49910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":56256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109838,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249,"mean":1.0679838709677,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.89285714285714,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/status\/397680154647883776","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1883570],"posted_on":"2013-11-05T11:01:52+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"397680154647883776"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IanLane88\/status\/408882777371582468","license":"public","citation_ids":[1883570],"posted_on":"2013-12-06T08:57:05+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"IanLane88","tweeter_id":"1621645309"},"tweet_id":"408882777371582468"}]}}
