We report successful use of an Airway Scope with a pediatric blade in four children with difficult airways. Difficult tracheal intubation had been predicted in all the children, and two had history of difficult intubation. Tracheal intubation using an Airway Scope was always easy. We conclude that the Airway Scope with a pediatric blade is potentially useful in children with difficult airways.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd0b","authors":["Takero Arai","Mai Nozawa","Maki Yamada","Hiroaki Suzuki","Tomoya Terauchi","Yuichiro Kuno","Yasuhisa Okuda"],"first_seen_on":"2013-11-05T11:21:49+00:00","issns":["0021-4892"],"issue":"7","journal":"Masui The Japanese journal of anesthesiology","last_mentioned_on":1383650467,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23905410?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23905410","pubdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"[Anesthesia for four pediatric patients with difficult airway in whom airway scope was useful for Intubation].","type":"article","volume":"62"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631967,"mean":4.9253635474614,"rank":2898477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631967,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97666,"mean":7.7145406645168,"rank":77232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97666,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":611,"mean":0.57385245901639,"rank":243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":611,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.72352941176471,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/status\/397685000809619456","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1883687],"posted_on":"2013-11-05T11:21:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
