In the non-CRT heart failure population, however, a wide QRS duration is associated with a shorter survival. Relative survival benefit from a therapy, however, is not synonymous with a longer absolute survival. We sought to determine whether baseline QRS duration relates to the absolute survival after CRT.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6083cf058f61000696a","authors":["Maurizio Gasparini","Cristophe Leclercq","Cheuk-Man Yu","Angelo Auricchio","Jonathan S.
