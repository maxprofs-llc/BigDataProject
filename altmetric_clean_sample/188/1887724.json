Decades of research using Sendai-virus or polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated fusion in tissue culture showed that the terminally differentiated state of a cell could be altered. But whether stable non-dividing heterokaryons could occur in animals has remained unclear. Here, we show that green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive bone-marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) contribute to adult mouse Purkinje neurons through cell fusion. The formation of heterokaryons increases in a linear manner over 1.5 years and seems to be stable. The dominant Purkinje neurons caused the BMDC nuclei within the resulting heterokaryons to enlarge, exhibit dispersed chromatin and activate a Purkinje neuron-specific transgene, L7-GFP. The observed reprogrammed heterokaryons that form in brain may provide insights into gene regulation associated with cell-fate plasticity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003163","authors":["James M Weimann","Clas B Johansson","Angelica Trejo","Helen M Blau"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncb1053","first_seen_on":"2013-11-06T20:31:52+00:00","issns":["1465-7392"],"issue":"11","journal":"Nature Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1431408599,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14562057"],"pmid":"14562057","pubdate":"2003-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Stable reprogrammed heterokaryons form spontaneously in Purkinje neurons after bone marrow transplant.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stable-reprogrammed-heterokaryons-form-spontaneously-purkinje-neurons-after-bone-marrow-transplant"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5090501,"mean":6.0303787922621,"rank":1045892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":4037140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5090501,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110638,"mean":7.9006412502147,"rank":25608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":84883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110638,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2202,"mean":8.4220845070422,"rank":703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":1493,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2202,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":25.479043478261,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":24,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
