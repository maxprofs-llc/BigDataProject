With a sample of 542 working adults, the current study examined (a) the degree to which perceiving a calling and living a calling differed according to yearly income and level of educational attainment and (b) potential mediators that may explain the link between perceiving a calling and living a calling. Adults with higher yearly incomes and more education were significantly more likely to endorse living a calling, but no significant group differences were found for perceiving a calling. Additionally, using structural equation modeling, work volition was found to be a significant mediator in the link between perceiving a calling and living a calling, and organizational support was found to be a significant mediator in the link between work volition and living a calling. The strength and significance of these indirect effects were supported by bootstrapping techniques. We suggest that part of the reason people with a calling feel more able to live out that calling is because of increased feelings of control in their career decision making. Implications for research and practice are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d3e","authors":["Ryan D Duffy","Kelsey L Autin","Duffy RD","Autin KL"],"doi":"10.1037\/a0031934","endpage":"227","first_seen_on":"2013-11-05T20:59:03+00:00","issns":["0022-0167","1939-2168"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Counseling Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1474607240,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23438413","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1037\/a0031934"],"pmid":"23438413","pubdate":"2013-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"219","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Disentangling the link between perceiving a calling and living a calling.","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/disentangling-link-between-perceiving-calling-living-calling"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":4001224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4234815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149991,"mean":7.1768739382628,"rank":58540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":87123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149991,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1212,"mean":2.4770090834021,"rank":272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1212,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.15,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":13,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
