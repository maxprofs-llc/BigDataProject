Cucumarioside A(2)-2 is a pentaoside having glucose as a third monosaccahride unit. We compared the effects of frondoside A and A(2)-2 for cell death-inducing capability with close attention paid to structure-activity relationships. Both frondoside A and A(2)-2 strongly induced apoptosis of leukemic cells. Frondoside A-induced apoptosis was more potent and rapid than A(2)-2-induced apoptosis. A(2)-2-induced but not frondoside A-induced apoptosis was caspase-dependent. This suggests that holothurians may induce apoptosis of leukemic cells caspase-dependently or -independently, depending on the holothurian structure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b7","authors":["Jun-O Jin","Valeria V Shastina","Sung-Won Shin","Qi Xu","Joo-In Park","Valery A Rasskazov","Sergey A
