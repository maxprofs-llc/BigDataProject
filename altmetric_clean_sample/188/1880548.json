While deficits in the auditory MMN are robust electrophysiological findings in schizophrenia, little is known about visual mismatch response and its association with social cognitive functions such as emotion recognition in schizophrenia. Our aim was to study the potential deficit in the visual mismatch response to unexpected facial emotions in schizophrenia and its association with emotion recognition impairments, and to localize the sources of the mismatch signals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["G\u00e1bor Csukly","G\u00e1bor Stefanics","Sarolta Koml\u00f3si","Istv\u00e1n Czigler","P\u00e1l Czobor"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0075444","first_seen_on":"2013-11-04T09:14:02+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"10","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1383556418,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0075444"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0075444.pdf","pmid":"24116046","pubdate":"2013-10-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e75444","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Emotion-Related Visual Mismatch Responses in Schizophrenia: Impairments and Correlations with Emotion Recognition","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emotionrelated-visual-mismatch-responses-schizophrenia-impairments-correlations-emotion-recognition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629910,"mean":4.9315517540573,"rank":2900039,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629910,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97105,"mean":7.7564317844788,"rank":76921,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97105,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64081,"mean":8.286084238452,"rank":50250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64081,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3893,"mean":10.789726618705,"rank":3212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3893,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
