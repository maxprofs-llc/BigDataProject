This knowledge reflects the past and present focus on protein-coding genes as the main reservoir of pathogenic variation in the human genome. However, the 'Medical Genome' includes all the functional genomic elements for which genotypic variability is a source of pathogenic phenotypes. This short review focuses on examples of pathogenic variants in non-protein-coding gene regions. It is likely that the evolving methods of DNA sequencing and functional characterization of the genome will enhance our understanding of the contribution by all functional genomic elements in both Mendelian and complex phenotypes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002559","authors":["Makrythanasis, P","Antonarakis, SE"],"doi":"10.1111\/cge.12272","endpage":"428","first_seen_on":"2013-11-06T05:12:54+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1399-0004","0009-9163"],"issue":"5","journal":"Clinical Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1393890696,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cge.12272\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cge.12272\/pdf","pmid":"24007299","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"422","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Pathogenic variants in non\u2010protein\u2010coding sequences","type":"article","volume":"84","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pathogenic-variants-nonproteincoding-sequences"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6712167,"mean":6.1609586696736,"rank":2803917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3755031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6712167,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142727,"mean":6.8914034163364,"rank":52079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":86434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142727,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1046,"mean":3.1331215311005,"rank":626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1046,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":3.589375,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
