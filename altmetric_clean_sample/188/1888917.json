With this in mind, the coordination chemistry of NTPs is critically reviewed and the conditions are defined for studies aiming to describe the properties of monomeric complexes because at higher concentrations (>1 mM) self-stacking may take place. The metal ion (M(2+)) complexes of purine-NTPs are more stable than those of pyrimidine-NTPs; this stability enhancement is attributed, in accord with NMR studies, to macrochelate formation of the phosphate-coordinated M(2+) with N7 of the purine residue and the formation degrees of the resulting isomeric complexes are listed. Furthermore, the formation of mixed-ligand complexes (including also those with buffer molecules), the effect of a reduced solvent polarity on complex stability and structure (giving rise to selectivity), the use of nucleotide analogues as antiviral agents, and the effect of metal ions on group transfer reactions are summarized.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ee","authors":["Helmut Sigel","Rolf Griesser"],"doi":"10.1039\/b505986k","first_seen_on":"2013-11-07T09:08:53+00:00","issns":["1460-4744"],"issue":"10","journal":"Chemical Society Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1383815265,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2005\/cs\/b505986k#.UntX_yHTeKk.facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2005\/cs\/b505986k","pmid":"16172677","pubdate":"2005-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"875","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Nucleoside 5\u2032-triphosphates: self-association, acid\u2013base, and metal ion-binding properties in solution","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nucleoside-5triphosphates-selfassociation-acidbase-metal-ionbinding-properties-solution"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628077,"mean":4.9442940120368,"rank":2904725,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628077,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97625,"mean":7.7387620257316,"rank":77407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97625,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":801,"mean":2.46475,"rank":625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":801,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.91666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
