To date, most of the identified mutations result in disruption of surface expression or altered channel properties of \u03b11-containing GlyRs. Little evidence has emerged to support an involvement of allosteric GlyR modulation in human hyperekplexia. Here, we report that recombinant human GlyRs containing \u03b11 or \u03b11\u03b2 subunits with a missense mutation in the \u03b11 subunit (W170S), previously identified from familial hyperekplexia, caused remarkably reduced potentiation and enhanced inhibition by Zn(2+). Interestingly, mutant \u03b11(W170S)\u03b2 GlyRs displayed no significant changes in potency or maximum response to glycine, taurine, or \u03b2-alanine. By temporally separating the potentiating and the inhibitory effects of Zn(2+), we found that the enhancement of Zn(2+) inhibition resulted from a loss of Zn(2+)-mediated potentiation. The W170S mutation on the background of H107N, which was previously reported to selectively disrupt Zn(2+) inhibition, showed remarkable attenuation of Zn(2+)-mediated potentiation and thus indicated that W170 is an important residue for the Zn(2+)-mediated GlyR potentiation. Moreover, overexpressing the \u03b11(W170S) subunit in cultured rat neurons confirmed the results from heterologous expression. Together, our results reveal a new zinc potentiation site on \u03b11 GlyRs and a strong link between Zn(2+) modulation and human disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Ning Zhou","Chen-Hung Wang","Shu Zhang","Dong Chuan Wu"],"doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.3240-13.2013","first_seen_on":"2013-11-06T18:25:10+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"45","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1383762277,"links":["http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/33\/45\/17675.abstract?etoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/33\/45\/17675.full.pdf","pmid":"24198360","pubdate":"2013-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society for Neuroscience","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"17675","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"The GLRA1 Missense Mutation W170S Associates Lack of Zn2+ Potentiation with Human Hyperekplexia","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glra1-missense-mutation-w170s-associates-lack-zn2-potentiation-human-hyperekplexia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626596,"mean":4.9527436744422,"rank":2907458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":72867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626596,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97502,"mean":7.7599883078123,"rank":77390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97502,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9098,"mean":6.1563856216335,"rank":7440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":421,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9098,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274,"mean":9.715663003663,"rank":224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
