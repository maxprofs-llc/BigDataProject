Wheat stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, is a devastating disease of wheat worldwide. Development of cultivars with effective resistance has been the primary means to control this disease, but the appearance of new virulent strains such as Ug99 has rendered most wheat varieties vulnerable. The stem rust resistance gene SrCad located on chromosome arm 6DS has provided excellent resistance to various strains of Ug99 in field nurseries conducted in Njoro, Kenya since 2005. Three genetic populations were used to identify SNP markers closely linked to the SrCad locus. Of 220 SNP markers evaluated, 27 were found to be located within a 2\u00a0cM region surrounding SrCad. The diagnostic potential of these SNPs was evaluated in a diverse set of 50 wheat lines that were primarily of Canadian origin with known presence or absence of SrCad. Three SNP markers tightly linked proximally to SrCad and one SNP that co-segregated with SrCad were completely predictive of the presence or absence of SrCad. These markers also differentiated SrCad from Sr42 and SrTmp which are also located in the same region of chromosome arm 6DS. These markers should be useful in marker-assisted breeding to develop new wheat varieties containing SrCad-based resistance to Ug99 stem rust.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000364b","authors":["Kassa, Mulualem T","You, Frank M","Fetch, Tom G","Fobert, Pierre","Sharpe, Andrew","Pozniak, Curtis J","Menzies, James G","Jordan, Mark C","Humphreys, Gavin","Zhu, Tingting","Luo, Ming-Cheng","McCartney, Curt A","Hiebert, Colin W","Mulualem T.
