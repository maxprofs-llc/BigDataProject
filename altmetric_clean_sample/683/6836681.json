When the same condensation reaction was performed with 1R,3S-diamino-1,7,7-trimethylcyclopentane as the diamine, the 2\u2009:\u20092 addition compound tmcp-(im)N4S4 was obtained selectively. Reduction of the diimines gave the saturated analogues chxn-N2S2 () and tmcp-N4S4 () the former of which could be phosphorylated with PhP(NMe2)2 to give the novel 13-membered macrocycle chxn-PS2, . Introduction of the phenylphosphine function proved stereoselective with a preference for the N(R)\/N(S) configuration at the nitrogen atoms. The coordination chemistry of the novel phosphine has been explored with Cu(i) and Mo(0) through formation of the complexes Cu()I, , and Mo(CO)3(), . Extension of the phosphorylation chemistry to tmcp-N4S4 () proved unsuccessful but ring closure reactions of both and with triethylorthoformate gave cyclic amidinium salts which are potential precursors to macrocyclic N-heterocyclic carbenes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Paul David Newman","Benson Kariuki","Alexander Smyth","Katy Cox","Katrina Cox","Benson M.
