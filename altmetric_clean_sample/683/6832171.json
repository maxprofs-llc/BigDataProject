Previously, we showed that chronically elevated network activity induces vulnerability in neurons due to loss of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling in response to the impairment of the serine\/threonine kinase, extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1\/2 (Erk1\/2) activation. However, how phosphorylation of Erk1\/2 decreases during elevated neuronal activity was unknown. Here I show the pErk1\/2 decrease induced by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), an A-type potassium channel inhibitor can be blocked by a broad-spectrum matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor, FN-439. Surface expression levels of integrin \u03b21 dramatically decrease when neurons are challenged by chronically elevated activity, which is reversed by FN-439. Treatment with 4-AP induces degradation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), the mediator of integrin signaling. As a result, interactions between FAK and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), the adaptor protein that mediates Erk1\/2 activation by integrin, are severely impaired. Together, these data suggest the loss of integrin signaling during elevated activity causes vulnerability in neurons.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Murase, Sachiko"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms160715659","endpage":"15669","first_seen_on":"2016-04-20T10:54:05+00:00","issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"7","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1461147913,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26184168"],"pmid":"26184168","pubdate":"2015-07-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"15659","title":"Impaired Focal Adhesion Kinase-Grb2 Interaction during Elevated Activity in Hippocampal Neurons","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impaired-focal-adhesion-kinasegrb2-interaction-during-elevated-activity-hippocampal-neurons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7578098,"mean":6.5350293264878,"rank":5735215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1016085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7578098,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267248,"mean":11.289233256126,"rank":187061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267248,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4585,"mean":2.2615519197208,"rank":2641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":1239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4585,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":360,"mean":2.3265013927577,"rank":226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":360,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
