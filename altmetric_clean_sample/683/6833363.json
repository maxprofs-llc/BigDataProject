In this work, a novel method to produce nonfouling zwitterionic hydrogel coatings was developed to achieve these goals. Poly(carboxybetaine acrylamide) (pCBAA) hydrogel thin films (CBHTFs) prepared with a carboxybetaine diacrylamide crosslinker (CBAAX) were coated on gold and silicon dioxide surfaces via a simple spin coating process. The thickness of CBHTFs could be precisely controlled between 15 and 150 nm by varying the crosslinker concentration, and the films demonstrated excellent long-term stability. Protein adsorption from undiluted human blood serum onto the CBHTFs was measured with surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Hydrogel thin films greater than 20 nm exhibited ultra-low fouling (<5 ng\/cm(2)). In addition, the CBHTFs were capable of high antibody functionalization for specific biomarker detection without compromising their nonfouling performance. This strategy provides a facile method to modify SPR biosensor chips with an advanced nonfouling material, and can be potentially expanded to a variety of implantable medical devices and diagnostic biosensors.\nIn this work, we developed an approach to realize ultra-low fouling and high ligand loading with a highly-crosslinked, purely zwitterionic, carboxybetaine thin film hydrogel (CBHTF) coating platform. The CBHTF on a hydrophilic surface demonstrated long-term stability. By varying the crosslinker content in the spin-coated hydrogel solution, the thickness of CBHTFs could be precisely controlled. Optimized CBHTFs exhibited ultra-low nonspecific protein adsorption below 5 ng\/cm2 measured by a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor, and their 3D architecture allowed antibody loading to reach 693 ng\/cm2. This strategy provides a facile method to modify SPR biosensor chips with an advanced nonfouling material, and can be potentially expanded to a variety of implantable medical devices and diagnostic biosensors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000682a","authors":["Chou, Ying-Nien","Sun, Fang","Hung, Hsiang-Chieh","Jain, Priyesh","Sinclair, Andrew","Zhang, Peng","Bai, Tao","Chang, Yung","Wen, Ten-Chin","Yu, Qiuming","Jiang, Shaoyi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.actbio.2016.04.023","first_seen_on":"2016-04-20T11:36:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-7568","17427061"],"journal":"Acta Biomaterialia","last_mentioned_on":1461152168,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27090589?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27090589","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Ultra-Low Fouling and High Antibody Loading Zwitterionic Hydrogel Coatings for Sensing and Detection in Complex Media","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultralow-fouling-high-antibody-loading-zwitterionic-hydrogel-coatings-sensing-detection-complex-medi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7578098,"mean":6.5350293264878,"rank":6562138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7578098,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267247,"mean":11.289286537497,"rank":224159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267247,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1177,"mean":5.0204897959184,"rank":957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1177,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":7.4700243902439,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
