To reduce the PM2.5 (mass of particles below 2.5 \u03bcm in diameter) concentration of individual's living environment, ionic liquid modified polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers with superior PM2.5 capture capacity was prepared by electrospinning. The ionic liquid diethylammonium dihydrogen phosphate (DEAP) with high viscosity and hydrophilicity was involved during the electrospinning process. Observations by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and water contact angle measurement suggested the modification of DEAP on PAN effectively altered the morphology (roughness) and surface properties (hydrophilicity) of the PAN nanofibers. The PM2.5 capture measurement was performed in a closed and static system, which mimicked the static hazy weather without wind flow. As a result, DEAP modified PAN nanofibers exhibited significantly enhanced PM2.5 capture capacity compared to that of the bare PAN nanofibers. This can be attributed to the improved surface roughness (i.e. improved adsorption sites), hydrophilicity and dipole moment of PAN upon DEAP modification.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Lin Jing","Jing, Lin","Shim, Kyubin","Toe, Cui Ying","Fang, Tim","Zhao, Chuan","Amal, Rose","Sun, Kening","Kim, Jung Ho","Ng, Yun Hau","Kyubin Shim","Cui Ying Toe","Tim Fang","Chuan Zhao","Rose Amal","Ke-Ning Sun","Jung Ho Kim","Yun Hau Ng"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsami.5b12313","endpage":"7036","first_seen_on":"2016-04-20T11:10:00+00:00","issns":["1944-8252","1944-8244"],"issue":"11","journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1461030488,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsami.5b12313"],"pmid":"26918821","pubdate":"2016-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
