We report here one such case in a 55-year-old lady who presented to us with upper abdominal pain for 6\u00a0months. A polypoidal gallbladder mass with minimal liver invasion but with multiple subcentimeter pericholedochal, common hepatic, mesenteric, and para-aortic lymph nodes was found on contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan. At laparotomy, the abdomen had milky fluid with engorged beaded lymphatics all over the small intestine. The abdomen was closed over a drain after a lymph node biopsy and collection of the ascetic fluid for analysis. Histopathology confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma in the lymph node. The triglyceride levels in the ascetic fluid were elevated to 817.00\u00a0mg\/dl. The patient was put on medium-chain triglyceride diet and a diuretic and recovered well. She was discharged when drain output was nil. Chylous ascites could be a result of abdominal malignancy, post surgery, cirrhosis, and disseminated infections like tuberculosis and filariasis. Treatment is primarily conservative and includes paracentesis\/drainage of the peritoneal cavity supplemented by fasting, total parenteral nutrition, and\/or diet modification with medium-chain triglyceride diet.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ab2","authors":["Mallika Tewari","Rupesh Singh","H.
