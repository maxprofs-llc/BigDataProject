Thus, Cu chelation therapy should be considered as a valuable strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, more attention should be paid to the specific chelating ability of these chelating agents. Herein, a tripeptide GGH was used to selectively chelate the Cu(2+) in A\u03b2-Cu complex in the presence of other metal ions (e.g., K(+), Ca(2+), Ni(2+), Mg(2+), and Zn(2+)) as shown by the isothermal titration calorimetry results. GGH decreased the level of HO\u2022 radicals by preventing the formation of intermediate Cu(I) ion. Thus, the Cu species completely lost its catalytic activity at a superequimolar GGH\/Cu(II) ratio (4:1) as observed by UV-visible spectroscopy, coumarin-3-carboxylic acid fluorescence, and BCA assay. Moreover, (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assay indicates that GGH increased the PC-12 cell viability from 36% to 63%, and the neurotoxicity partly triggered by ROS decreased. These results indicate potential development of peptide chelation therapy for AD treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006812","authors":["Hu, Xiaoyu","Zhang, Qian","Wang, Wei","Yuan, Zhi","Zhu, XuShan","Chen, Bing","Chen, Xingyu"],"doi":"10.1021\/acschemneuro.6b00145","first_seen_on":"2016-07-23T17:14:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1948-7193"],"journal":"ACS Chemical Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1469294027,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27433833"],"pmid":"27433833","pubdate":"2016-07-19T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"A tripeptide GGH as the inhibitor of copper-amyloid-\u03b2-mediated redox reaction and toxicity","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tripeptide-ggh-inhibitor-copperamyloid%CE%B2mediated-redox-reaction-toxicity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8093786,"mean":6.8854606510969,"rank":1157971,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6862155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8093786,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257340,"mean":11.970491359646,"rank":52550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":201576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257340,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":663,"mean":7.1686827794562,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":663,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":8.029625,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
