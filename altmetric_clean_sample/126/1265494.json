To date, however, most of the structures formed using this method exhibit a broad size distribution and are disorderly adsorbed on the surface. Here we demonstrate a strategy of using metal-directed template to control the on-surface polymerization process. We chose a bifunctional compound which contains pyridyl and bromine end groups as the precursor. Linear template afforded by pyridyl-Cu-pyridyl coordination effectively promoted Ullmann coupling of the monomers on a Au(111) surface. Taking advantage of efficient topochemical enhancement owing to the conformation flexibility of the Cu-pyridyl bonds, macromolecular porphyrin structures that exhibit a narrow size distribution were synthesized. We used scanning tunneling microscopy and kinetic Monte Carlo simulation to gain insights into the metal-directed polymerization at the single molecule level. The results reveal that the polymerization process profited from the rich chemistry of Cu which catalyzed the C-C bond formation, controlled the size of the macromolecular products, and organized the macromolecules in a highly ordered manner on the surface.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Tao Lin"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja311890n","first_seen_on":"2013-02-26T19:40:10+00:00","issns":["0002-7863"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1362542100,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja311890n","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/ja311890n"],"pmid":"23427979","pubdate":"2013-02-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Steering On-Surface Polymerization with Metal-Directed Template","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/steering-onsurface-polymerization-metaldirected-template"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":414788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4085881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89238,"mean":6.4061414211595,"rank":10392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":78734,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89238,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15478,"mean":4.1097822575435,"rank":1514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":13923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15478,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":646,"mean":3.7806108527132,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":646,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
