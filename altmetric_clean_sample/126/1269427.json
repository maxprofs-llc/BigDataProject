While military metaphors are a recent adoption when used to describe dementia, in oncology there has been longstanding debate about the usefulness of such metaphors. This article reviews the history of military metaphors in medicine, literature discussing their use, and considers their use in describing dementia. While military metaphors are widely used in medicine, consideration should be taken in their use as they have the potential to influence the way we and our patients conceptualise and experience illness and treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f6100021a6","authors":["Jennifer Philip","Heather Patricia Lane","SueAnne McLachlan"],"doi":"10.1093\/ageing\/aft011","first_seen_on":"2013-02-28T03:40:42+00:00","issns":["1468-2834","0002-0729"],"issue":"3","journal":"Age & Ageing","last_mentioned_on":1461139972,"links":["http:\/\/ageing.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/02\/26\/ageing.aft011.short?rss=1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23446313","http:\/\/ageing.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/42\/3\/281.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ageing.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/02\/26\/ageing.aft011.full.pdf","pmid":"23446313","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"The war against dementia: are we battle weary yet?","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/war-against-dementia-we-battle-weary"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7578098,"mean":6.5350293264878,"rank":529894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7046562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7578098,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114925,"mean":6.4441206362466,"rank":8983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":105902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114925,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1624,"mean":10.83217991374,"rank":284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":1339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1624,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":5.45,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":12,"researcher":3,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":12,"Scientists":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
