The high-pressure quenched-flow technique could be an absolute method for counting active sites and for activation studies of molecular catalysts. A kinetic study of metallocene catalysts and a phenoxy-imine titanium catalyst in the first instants of polymerization is presented in this paper.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Christophe Boisson","Maria Maddalena Ranieri","Francesco Cutillo","Jean-Pierre Broyer","Timothy McKenna","Maria M.
