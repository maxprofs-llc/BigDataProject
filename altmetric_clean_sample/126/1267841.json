Removal of adhesions is must for ocular surface reconstruction but chances of recurrence are more in simple removal. A study was done among 10 eyes of 10 patients to see the efficacy, safety and outcome of symblepharon excision with amniotic membrane transplantation. All the patients were operated by a single surgeon with standard technique and all of them were followed up for 6 months. All eyes exhibit a stable, intact corneal epithelial surface and healthy conjunctival growth without developing recurrent erosion or persistent epithelial defect. Visual improvement was seen in 60% of cases. Eighty per cent patients showed symptomatic relief. All eyes exhibited decreased vascularisation and inflammation at final follow-up. Thus, amniotic membrane transplantation is very effective in ocular surface reconstruction in cases of symblepharon and limbal stem cell deficiency.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9173cf058f61000d161","authors":["Patel AP","Satani DR","Singh S","Desai S"],"first_seen_on":"2013-02-27T15:09:52+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of the Indian Medical Association","last_mentioned_on":1361977786,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23360041"],"pmid":"23360041","pubdate":"2013-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Application of amniotic membrane transplantation in cases of symblepharon.","type":"article","volume":"110","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/application-amniotic-membrane-transplantation-cases-symblepharon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3557740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89074,"mean":6.4461978377287,"rank":71285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89074,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":1.1957627118644,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.1,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"TR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Loose_Lab_Rat\/statuses\/306783189307883520","license":"public","citation_ids":[1267841],"posted_on":"2013-02-27T15:09:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Kelly A.
