It is has been repeatedly shown that at the latitude of the United States there are vitamin D disparities related to skin color. Although inadequate vitamin D status and health disparities have been associated with many of the same diseases, neither nutrition policy nor public health policy in the United States currently recognizes any role at all for vitamin D as a determinant of health disparities.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e8b","authors":["Weishaar T","Vergili JM"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jand.2012.12.011","first_seen_on":"2013-02-25T19:59:09+00:00","issns":["2212-2672"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics","last_mentioned_on":1371723228,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23415504?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23415504","pubdate":"2013-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Vitamin D Status Is a Biological Determinant of Health Disparities.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitamin-d-status-biological-determinant-health-disparities-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
