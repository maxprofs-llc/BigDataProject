Multiple column tests were performed at the University at Buffalo (UB) and WVDP for periods ranging from 6 months to 2 years; UB columns were supplied with synthetic groundwater referenced to anticipated field conditions, while radioactive groundwater obtained on site was used for the WVDP columns. The primary focus was on quantifying the competitive cation reactions among five cations (Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Sr(2+)) and Sr-90 with data obtained from the column studies used to estimate Gaines-Thomas (GT) selectivity coefficients. The resulting six-solute transport model provided flexibility to explore the influence of PTW parameters on long-term PTW performance, including variations in Sr-90 concentrations and groundwater geochemistry. The natural zeolite PTW is a viable method for in situ removal of Sr-90 from groundwater and potentially applicable to other sites contaminated by Sr-90.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ef","authors":["Shannon M.
