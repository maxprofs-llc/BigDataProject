However, many of its benefits depend on the use of coded terminologies. Two standard terminologies (ICD-9 and SNOMED-CT) are available for problem documentation, and two SNOMED-CT subsets (VA\/KP and CORE) are available for SNOMED-CT users. We set out to examine these subsets, characterize their overlap and measure their coverage. We applied the subsets to a random sample of 100,000 records from Brigham and Women's Hospital to determine the proportion of problems covered. Though CORE is smaller (5,814 terms vs. 17,761 terms for VA\/KP), 94.8% of coded problem entries from BWH were in the CORE subset, while only 84.0% of entries had matches in VA\/KP (p<0.001). Though both subsets had reasonable coverage, CORE was superior in our sample, and had fewer clinically significant gaps.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbc6","authors":["Wright A","Feblowitz J","McCoy AB","Sittig DF"],"first_seen_on":"2013-02-26T11:19:44+00:00","funders":["phs"],"issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"AMIA Annual Symposium Proceedings","last_mentioned_on":1361877579,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22195218?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22195218","pubdate":"2011-12-24T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Comparative Analysis of the VA\/Kaiser and NLM CORE Problem Subsets: An Empirical Study Based on Problem Frequency.","type":"article","volume":"2011","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-analysis-vakaiser-nlm-core-problem-subsets-empirical-study-based-problem-frequency"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3078329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":957641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89239,"mean":6.4139747192901,"rank":59722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":18795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89239,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301,"mean":1.9286533333333,"rank":191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":1.4883428571429,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
