This paper draws upon data from a qualitative empirical study to investigate parents' use of the moral ideal of authenticity as part of their narrative justifications for dosing decisions and actions. I show that therapeutic decisions and actions are embedded in valued cultural ideals about masculinity, self-actualization and success, as well as in moral conceptions of authenticity and personal freedom. I argue that this investigation of parents' moral justifications and dosing dilemmas raises questions about the validity of authenticity as a transcendent moral principle. Moreover, this study demonstrates that in order to be relevant, bioethical analysis of neurocognitive enhancement must engage with ground-up studies of moral principles and decision-making in context.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f61000159b","authors":[" Ilina   Singh "],"doi":"10.1080\/15265160590945129","endpage":"47","first_seen_on":"2013-02-26T19:06:16+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1526-5161","1536-0075"],"issue":"3","journal":"The American Journal of Bioethics","last_mentioned_on":1361905568,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/15265160590945129"],"pmid":"16006369","pubdate":"2004-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Routledge","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"34","subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Will the \u201cReal Boy\u201d Please Behave: Dosing Dilemmas for Parents of Boys with ADHD","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/real-boy-please-behave-dosing-dilemmas-parents-boys-adhd"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628563,"mean":4.9406420973419,"rank":234690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":3388058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628563,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85577,"mean":6.1379041787418,"rank":7452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":78056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85577,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":382,"mean":4.6652020997375,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":382,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":3.2250833333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
