Compared with the patients in the physical therapy group, the patients in the hypnotherapy group showed a significantly better outcome with respect to their pain experience, fatigue on awakening, sleep pattern and global assessment at 12 and 24 weeks, but this was not reflected in an improvement of the total myalgic score measured by a dolorimeter. At baseline most patients in both groups had strong feelings of somatic and psychic discomfort as measured by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist. These feelings showed a significant decrease in patients treated by hypnotherapy compared with physical therapy, but they remained abnormally strong in many cases. We conclude hypnotherapy may be useful in relieving symptoms in patients with refractory fibromyalgia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005aa5","authors":["Haanen HC","Hoenderdos HT","van Romunde LK","Hop WC","Mallee C","Terwiel JP","Hekster GB"],"first_seen_on":"2013-02-26T20:21:22+00:00","issns":["0315-162X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1468686169,"links":["http:\/\/ukpmc.ac.uk\/abstract\/MED\/2023202\/reload=0;jsessionid=q99l4UVbPrw4sLzSvCPk.0","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2023202"],"pmid":"2023202","pubdate":"1991-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Controlled trial of hypnotherapy in the treatment of refractory fibromyalgia.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/controlled-trial-hypnotherapy-treatment-refractory-fibromyalgia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8078414,"mean":6.8578859978971,"rank":3682172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4315624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8078414,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116919,"mean":6.6493382028432,"rank":46188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":69189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116919,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1622,"mean":3.3875385564466,"rank":766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1622,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.6847826086957,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
