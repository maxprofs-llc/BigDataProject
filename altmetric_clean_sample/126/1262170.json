We sampled sediments and polychaete worms from mudflats in the Bay of Fundy to investigate the bioaccumulation of mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in the coastal invertebrate food web. Hg concentrations in the sediments were low (<20 \u03bcg kg(-1)). Labile Hg (methanol\/KOH sediment extraction) in surface sediments (0-1 cm) was positively correlated with Hg bioaccumulation by surface sediment-ingesting polychaetes but, surprisingly, there was a negative correlation between \u03b4(15)N (i.e. trophic level) and THg bioaccumulation factors in polychaete worms. Worms feeding on deeper sediments contained the greatest MeHg concentrations (69.6 \u03bcg kg(-1)). Polychaetes are an important vector for Hg biomagnification to the coastal avian food web. This research demonstrates that feeding depth and method of feeding are more important than trophic position or sediment Hg concentrations for predicting Hg bioaccumulation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006534","authors":["Sizmur T","Can\u00e1rio J","Gerwing TG","Mallory ML","O'Driscoll NJ","Tom Sizmur","Jo\u00e3o Can\u00e1rio","Travis G.
