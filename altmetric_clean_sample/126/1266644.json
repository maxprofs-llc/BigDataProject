TA at concentrations up to 20\u00a0\u03bcM, primarily found to be no toxic (in terms of cell viability, superoxide anions, nitric oxide and lipid peroxidation products currently estimated), significantly diminished the cytotoxic and oxidative effects induced by the metal (50 and\/or 100\u00a0\u03bcM) in all cases. On the other hand, higher concentrations of TA (40 and 60\u00a0\u03bcM) were toxic, thus enhancing Cd-mediated cytotoxic and oxidative effects. The present study showed TA beneficiary properties in hemocytes of mussels, at least at low concentrations, while TA at concentrations higher than 20\u00a0\u03bcM could serve as an excellent oxidized substrate, thus enhancing toxic effects either alone or with the presence of micromolar concentrations of non transition metals, such as\u00a0Cd.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5003cf058f61000304d","authors":["Bouki E","Dimitriadis VK","Kaloyianni M","Dailianis S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.marenvres.2012.12.005","first_seen_on":"2013-02-27T07:35:46+00:00","issns":["0141-1136","01411136"],"journal":"Marine Environmental Research","last_mentioned_on":1427306391,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0141113612002231"],"pmid":"23375356","pubdate":"2013-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Earth and Planetary Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Antioxidant and pro-oxidant challenge of tannic acid in mussel hemocytes exposed to cadmium ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antioxidant-prooxidant-challenge-tannic-acid-mussel-hemocytes-exposed-cadmium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4921996,"mean":5.8458217409833,"rank":3483036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":805009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4921996,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91933,"mean":6.6496257886264,"rank":61463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":16361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91933,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311,"mean":3.4925806451613,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.357,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
