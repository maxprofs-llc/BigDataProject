The IPW methods rely on the intuitive idea of creating a pseudo-population of weighted copies of the complete cases to remove selection bias introduced by the missing data. However, different weighting approaches are required depending on the missing data pattern and mechanism. We begin with a uniform missing data pattern (i.e. a scalar missing indicator indicating whether or not the full data is observed) to motivate the approach. We then generalise to more complex settings. Our goal is to provide a conceptual overview of existing IPW approaches and illustrate the connections and differences among these approaches.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035b8","authors":["Lingling Li","Changyu Shen","Xiaochun Li","James M Robins"],"doi":"10.1177\/0962280211403597","endpage":"30","first_seen_on":"2013-02-25T08:24:17+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1477-0334"],"issue":"1","journal":"Statistical Methods in Medical Research","last_mentioned_on":1362589600,"links":["http:\/\/smm.sagepub.com\/content\/22\/1\/14.abstract?rss=1","http:\/\/smm.sagepub.com\/lookup\/resid\/0962280211403597?view=abstract&uritype=cgi&ijkey=9WthcFl9AMgsw&keytype=ref&siteid=spsmm","http:\/\/smm.sagepub.com\/content\/22\/1\/14.abstract?utm_content=Visibility_and_reach_O&utm_medium=social_Twitter&utm_campaign=G_ALL_T_2012&utm_source=open&keytype=ref&siteid=spsmm&utm_term=Research_Methods_and_Evaluation&ijkey=9WthcFl9AMgsw"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/smm.sagepub.com\/content\/22\/1\/14.full.pdf","pmid":"21705435","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Statistics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Mathematics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"14","subjects":["statisticsastopic"],"title":"On weighting approaches for missing data","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/weighting-approaches-missing-data"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5483628,"mean":6.368159614429,"rank":2090817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3373748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5483628,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96032,"mean":6.6845666503525,"rank":30075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":65548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96032,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":428,"mean":2.2854332552693,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":428,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":5.1125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
