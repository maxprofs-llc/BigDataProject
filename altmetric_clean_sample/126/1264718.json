However little is known about the genes regulating the development of the central complex. Here we report that a mutant gene affecting central complex morphology, cbd (central brain defect), was mapped to ten-a, a type II trans-membrane protein coding gene. Down-regulation of ten-a in pan-neural cells contributed to abnormal morphology of central complex. Over-expression of ten-a by C767-Gal4 was able to partially restore the abnormal central complex morphology in the cbd mutant. Tracking the development of FB primordia revealed that C767-Gal4 labeled interhemispheric junction that separated fan-shaped body precursors at larval stage withdrew to allow the fusion of the precursors. While the C767-Gal4 labeled structure did not withdraw properly and detached from FB primordia, the two fan-shaped body precursors failed to fuse in the cbd mutant. We propose that the withdrawal of C767-Gal4 labeled structure is related to the formation of the fan-shaped body. Our result revealed the function of ten-a in central brain development, and possible cellular mechanism underlying Drosophila fan-shaped body formation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0057129","first_seen_on":"2013-02-26T14:29:30+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"2","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1362744822,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23437330?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23437330","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Ten-a Affects the Fusion of Central Complex Primordia in Drosophila.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tena-affects-fusion-central-complex-primordia-drosophila"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":3556803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":833285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93270,"mean":6.6286917625364,"rank":62109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":16998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93270,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88909,"mean":9.2643371575112,"rank":64995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":14187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88909,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4428,"mean":8.1865737519765,"rank":3025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":995,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4428,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
