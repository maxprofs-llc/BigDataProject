Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine levels (fT4) were available in 104 patients before and after allo-HSCT.\nThe median age at transplantation (n=104) was 47 (IQR 40-59)], 37 (35.6%) patients were female, and the overall mortality was 34.6% (n=36). After a median follow-up period of 47 (IQR 25-84) months, overt hypothyroidism (basal TSH>4.49mIU\/l, FT4<11.6pmol\/l) was observed in 4 patients (3.8%) and subclinical hypothyroidism (basal TSH>4.49mIU\/l, normal fT4) was observed in 20 patients (19.2%). Positive thyroperoxidase (TPO) antibodies were found in 5 (4.8%) patients. A total of 13 patients (12.5%) were treated with thyroid hormone replacement. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) \u2265grade 2 occurred in 55 (52.9%) and chronic GvHD (cGvHD) in 74 (71.2%) of the patients. The risk of developing hypothyroidism was higher in the patients with repeated allo-HSCTs (P=0.024) and with positive TPO antibodies (P=0.045). Furthermore, the development of overt hypothyroidism was inversely proportional to age (P=0.043). No correlation was found with GvHD, HLA-mismatch, total body irradiation, and gender.\nAfter allo-HSCT, a significant number of patients experience thyroid dysfunction, including subclinical and overt hypothyroidism. Long-term and continuous follow-up for thyroid function after HSCT is important to provide timely and appropriate treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fa3cf058f610003009","authors":["Michael Medinger","Deborah Zeiter","Dominik Heim","J\u00f6rg Halter","Sabine Gerull","Andr\u00e9 Tichelli","Jakob Passweg","Nicole Nigro"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.leukres.2017.04.003","first_seen_on":"2017-04-24T10:06:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01452126","1873-5835"],"journal":"Leukemia Research","last_mentioned_on":1493028344,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28433882?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28433882","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Hypothyroidism following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypothyroidism-following-allogeneic-hematopoietic-stem-cell-transplantation-acute-myeloid-leukemia-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8093859,"mean":6.8854427063012,"rank":7007080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8093859,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233399,"mean":12.676741394528,"rank":189899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233399,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":662,"mean":2.0174644478064,"rank":529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":662,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.434,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/856449069325078528","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19510690],"posted_on":"2017-04-24T10:05:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":722},"tweet_id":"856449069325078528"}]}}
