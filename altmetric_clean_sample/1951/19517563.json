Members of OHCs interact online with similar peers to seek, receive, and provide different types of social support, such as informational support, emotional support, and companionship. As active participations in an OHC are beneficial to both the OHC and its users, it is important to understand factors related to users' participations and predict user churn for user retention efforts.\nThis study aimed to analyze OHC users' Web-based interactions, reveal which types of social support activities are related to users' participation, and predict whether and when a user will churn from the OHC.\nWe collected a large-scale dataset from a popular OHC for cancer survivors. We used text mining techniques to decide what kinds of social support each post contained. We illustrated how we built text classifiers for 5 different social support categories: seeking informational support (SIS), providing informational support (PIS), seeking emotional support (SES), providing emotional support (PES), and companionship (COM). We conducted survival analysis to identify types of social support related to users' continued participation. Using supervised machine learning methods, we developed a predictive model for user churn.\nUsers' behaviors to PIS, SES, and COM had hazard ratios significantly lower than 1 (0.948, 0.972, and 0.919, respectively) and were indicative of continued participations in the OHC. The churn prediction model based on social support activities offers accurate predictions on whether and when a user will leave the OHC.\nDetecting different types of social support activities via text mining contributes to better understanding and prediction of users' participations in an OHC. The outcome of this study can help the management and design of a sustainable OHC via more proactive and effective user retention strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5733cf058f610004cb1","authors":["Xi Wang"],"doi":"10.2196\/jmir.6834","first_seen_on":"2017-04-24T14:06:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1438-8871"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Medical Internet Research","last_mentioned_on":1500474364,"links":["http:\/\/www.jmir.org\/2017\/4\/e130\/","http:\/\/www.jmir.org\/2017\/4\/e130\/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.jmir.org\/2017\/4\/e130\/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+JMedInternetRes+%28Journal+of+Medical+Internet+Research+%28atom%29%29","https:\/\/www.jmir.org\/2017\/4\/e130\/","http:\/\/www.jmir.org\/2017\/4\/e130\/?platform=hootsuite"],"pmid":"28438725","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"JMIR Publications Inc., Toronto, Canada","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Analyzing and Predicting User Participations in Online Health Communities: A Social Support Perspective","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analyzing-predicting-user-participations-online-health-communities-social-support-perspective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":22.3,"score_history":{"1y":22.3,"6m":22.3,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":22.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8244534,"mean":6.9679504076153,"rank":386319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7857885,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8244534,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242216,"mean":12.628908416076,"rank":20887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":221306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242216,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2005,"mean":23.505896207585,"rank":477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":1523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2005,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":32.96875,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":27,"researcher":8,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":27,"Scientists":8,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
