Despite SMG-1 and mTOR belonging to the same PI3K-related kinase family, the interactions between them are not yet fully understood. In the present study, a novel pyrrolopyrimidine-derived compound, AZD5363, was observed to suppress proliferation in liver cancer Hep-G2 and Huh-7 cells by inhibiting the phosphorylation of downstream molecules in the AKT signal pathway, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. AZD5363 activated the phosphorylation of mTOR, dependent on the liver cancer cell type, as it may have differing effects in various liver cancer cell lines. Additionally, AZD5363 also activated SMG-1 within the same liver cancer cells types, which subsequently activated the phosphorylation of mTOR. In conclusion, the present study indicates that AZD5363 inhibited phosphorylation of AKT downstream molecules, and activated phosphorylation of mTOR and SMG-1, dependent on the liver cancer type.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000837d","authors":["Zhang, Yuncheng","Zheng, Yuanwen","Faheem, Ali","Sun, Tiantong","Li, Chunyou","Li, Zhe","Zhao, Diantang","Wu, Chao","Liu, Jun"],"doi":"10.3892\/ol.2016.4111","first_seen_on":"2016-03-22T14:09:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1792-1074","1792-1082"],"issue":"3","journal":"Oncology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1458655754,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26998062?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26998062","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"A novel AKT inhibitor, AZD5363, inhibits phosphorylation of AKT downstream molecules, and activates phosphorylation of mTOR and SMG\u20111 dependent on the liver cancer cell type","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-akt-inhibitor-azd5363-inhibits-phosphorylation-akt-downstream-molecules-activates-phosphorylat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7424901,"mean":6.4566625821178,"rank":6429299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7424901,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276266,"mean":10.978527898937,"rank":233759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276266,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1020,"mean":1.4129931305201,"rank":649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1020,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":0.57714285714286,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
