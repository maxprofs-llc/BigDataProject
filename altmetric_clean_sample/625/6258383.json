Chloroquine (CQ) is an autophagy inhibitor that is clinically used to treat malaria. The aims of this pilot clinical trial were to evaluate the therapeutic potential and short-term safety of CQ in patients with chronic HCV genotype 1, who were unresponsive to a combination of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin. Ten non-responders to previous antiviral treatment(s) were randomized to receive either CQ (150 mg daily for 8 weeks) or placebo, and were followed for 4 weeks after CQ therapy. HCV RNA load and plasma alanine transaminase (ALT) levels were measured at baseline, week 4 (initial response), week 8 (end-of-treatment response), and at the end of 12 weeks. A significant decrease in HCV RNA after the treatments (week 8) was observed in all patients in the CQ group (P = 0.04). However, HCV RNA levels increased within 4 weeks after discontinuation of CQ treatment although they were still lower than baseline. In addition, the ALT normalized during treatment in the CQ group. However, this response was also lost after treatment cessation. This study provides preliminary evidence that CQ is possibly a safe treatment option for HCV non-responders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000db0","authors":["Peymani, Payam","Yeganeh, Behzad","Sabour, Siamak","Geramizadeh, Bita","Fattahi, Mohammad Reza","Keyvani, Hossein","Azarpira, Negar","Coombs, Kevin M","Ghavami, Saied","Lankarani, Kamran B"," Payam Peymani"],"doi":"10.1139\/cjpp-2015-0507","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2016-03-22T10:36:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1205-7541","0008-4212"],"issue":"6","journal":"Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1472183148,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26998724?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/full\/10.1139\/cjpp-2015-0507#.VvQkz3pKaa5","http:\/\/www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1139\/cjpp-2015-0507?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&"],"pmid":"26998724","pubdate":"2016-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["physiology","pharmacology"],"title":"New use of an old drug: chloroquine reduces viral and ALT levels in HCV non-responders (a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial)","type":"article","volume":"94","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-old-drug-chloroquine-reduces-viral-alt-levels-hcv-nonresponders-randomized-tripleblind-placeboco"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":4406054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2305896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282606,"mean":11.236346794996,"rank":154704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":100140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282606,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":793,"mean":2.9948888888889,"rank":362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":793,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":4.2714736842105,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
