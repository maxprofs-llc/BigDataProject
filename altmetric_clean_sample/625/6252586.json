Currently, autoimmune pathogenesis has been attributed to more than 40 human diseases; yet it is still not clear what immune abnormalities conclusively prove underlying autoimmune pathogenesis. Hence, although much has been learned, research is still needed for complete elucidation of the mechanisms of the immune dysregulation in AIHA. Better understanding of the underlying mechanism(s) may allow for development of more specific therapies of these not uncommon and often difficult-to-treat disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008bdd","authors":["John Freedman"],"doi":"10.1159\/000437195","endpage":"285","first_seen_on":"2016-03-21T16:31:53+00:00","issns":["1660-3796","1660-3818"],"issue":"5","journal":"Transfusion Medicine and Hemotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1458561601,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4678316\/"],"pmcid":"PMC4678316","pmid":"26696795","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Karger Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"278","title":"Autoimmune Hemolysis: A Journey through Time","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/autoimmune-hemolysis-journey-through-time"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7419920,"mean":6.4520289205274,"rank":6424225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7419920,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276995,"mean":10.964842061561,"rank":234277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276995,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":1.9725333333333,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.275,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
