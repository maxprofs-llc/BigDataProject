Data were collected from onetime interviews with 44 caregivers living in the greater East Los Angeles area. Kinscripts guided the framing of familism in this study. Data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Caregivers' descriptions of the Mexican family reflected an idealized view of familism. Caregivers reported a lack of support from others and relying for support on fewer family members than were potentially available to them. Findings suggest that the construct of familism has evolved from its long-standing portrayals in the literature. More research is needed to reexamine familism as a theoretical perspective to explain how Mexican-origin families negotiate and construct elder care over the family life course.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4de3cf058f610001cf5","authors":["Mendez\u2010Luck, Carolyn A.","Applewhite, Steven R.","Lara, Vicente E.","Toyokawa, Noriko"],"doi":"10.1111\/jomf.12300","endpage":"829","first_seen_on":"2016-03-21T22:31:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1741-3737","0022-2445"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Marriage & Family","last_mentioned_on":1460994642,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jomf.12300\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview&utm_content=buffer7f9bc&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jomf.12300\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jomf.12300\/pdf","pmid":"27594714","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Demography","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Religion And Religious Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"startpage":"813","title":"The Concept of Familism in the Lived Experiences of Mexican\u2010Origin Caregivers","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/concept-familism-lived-experiences-mexicanorigin-caregivers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7565447,"mean":6.5306080289211,"rank":3460194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3935137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7565447,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278419,"mean":10.9959848142,"rank":127892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":141026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278419,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1111,"mean":11.782589189189,"rank":934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1111,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":48.352074074074,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
