The first phase of this mixed-methods design aimed to explore conflict resolution strategies in adolescent dating couples, and the second phase to document, from both the perspective of the individual and of the couple, dyadic interaction patterns distinguishing youth inflicting dating violence from those who do not. A sample of 39 heterosexual couples (mean age 17.8 years) participated in semi-structured interviews and were observed during a 45\u00a0min dyadic interaction. At phase 1, qualitative analysis revealed three main types of conflict resolution strategies: 1) negotiating expectations and individual needs; 2) avoiding conflicts or their resolution; 3) imposing personal needs and rules through the use of violence. At phase 2, we focused on couples with conflictive patterns. Results indicate that couples who inflict violence differ from nonviolent couples by their tendency to experience conflicts when in disagreement and to resort to negative affects as a resolution strategy. In addition, while at an individual level, they show a tendency to withdraw from conflict and to use less positive affect, at a dyadic level they present less symmetry. Results offer important insights for prevention programs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4de3cf058f610001ca5","authors":["Myl\u00e8ne Fernet","Martine H\u00e9bert","Alison Paradis"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.adolescence.2016.02.004","endpage":"59","first_seen_on":"2016-03-22T09:11:36+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["01401971","1095-9254"],"journal":"Journal of Adolescence","last_mentioned_on":1484501632,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0140197116000257","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5179251\/?report=classic"],"pmid":"26999441","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"PMC Canada manuscript submission","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"51","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Conflict resolution patterns and violence perpetration in adolescent couples: A gender-sensitive mixed-methods approach","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conflict-resolution-patterns-violence-perpetration-adolescent-couples-gendersensitive-mixedmethods-a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":2.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8071305,"mean":6.8537279477937,"rank":3237281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4809420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8071305,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281095,"mean":11.186020491365,"rank":101626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":177932,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281095,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":688,"mean":6.6723580786026,"rank":386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":688,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":9.4625,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
