All patients underwent hemivertebrectomy and transpedicular fixation procedures at an average age of 3.18\u00a0years (range 2-5\u00a0years). All had preoperative CT to evaluate the congenital deformities. Measurements were done at the instrumented vertebrae as well as the un-instrumented ones above and below them to evaluate; vertebral body parameters, pedicle parameters and spinal canal area of upper instrumented vertebra (UIV), lower instrumented vertebra (LIV), upper adjacent un-instrumented vertebra and lower adjacent un-instrumented vertebra.\nThe average follow-up was 7.2 (range 5-12) years. Six of the patients were over age 10 during the final CT examination while 5 were at age 7. Female-to male ratio was 8-3. Measurement of all the parameters in 22 instrumented and 22 non-instrumented segments showed a proportional increase rather than a decrease at each segment. The percentage of canal area growth at UIV and LIV was 21 and 17.5\u00a0%, respectively.\nPedicle screw instrumentation has no adverse effect on further spinal body, pedicle and canal growth and does not result in iatrogenic spinal canal stenosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002870","authors":["Sinan Kahraman","Selhan Karadereler","Mutlu Cobanoglu","Sinan Yilar","Ayhan Mutlu","Levent Onur Ulusoy","Azmi Hamzaoglu"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00586-016-4484-6","first_seen_on":"2016-03-21T13:35:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0932"],"journal":"European Spine Journal","last_mentioned_on":1458607286,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00586-016-4484-6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00586-016-4484-6.pdf","pmid":"27001135","pubdate":"2016-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Does pedicle screw fixation under age 5 cause spinal canal narrowing?
