(Miyasaka)"],"citation":{"abstract":"Construction of a molecular system in which the magnetic lattice exhibits long-range order is one of the fundamental goals in materials science. In this study, we demonstrate the artificial construction of a ferrimagnetic lattice by doping electrons into acceptor sites of a neutral donor\/acceptor metal-organic framework (D\/A-MOF). This doping was achieved by the insertion of Li-ions into the D\/A-MOF, which was used as the cathode of a Li-ion battery cell. The neutral D\/A-MOF is a layered system composed of a carboxylate-bridged paddlewheel-type diruthenium(II,II) complex as the donor and a TCNQ derivative as the acceptor. The ground state of the neutral form was a magnetically disordered paramagnetic state. Upon discharge of the cell, spontaneous magnetization was induced; the transition temperature was variable. The stability of the magnetically ordered lattice depended on the equilibrium electric potential of the D\/A-MOF cathode, which reflected the electron-filling level.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Taniguchi, Kouji","Narushima, Keisuke","Mahin, Julien","Kosaka, Wataru","Miyasaka, Hitoshi"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201601672","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-03-21T21:55:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773"],"issue":"17","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
