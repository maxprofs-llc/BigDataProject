The purpose of this study was to determine the factors that predict radiologic progression of non-CF bronchiectasis during a long-term follow-up.\nWe reviewed the electronic medical records that included pulmonary function test data from non-CF bronchiectasis patients, who were older than 18\u2009years of age with a follow-up of computerized tomography for more than 5\u2009years. The original Bhalla score was used to determine the radiologic severity of non-CF bronchiectasis.\nA total of 155 patients (mean age, 59.6\u2009years; male, 45.2%) were included for the final analysis. The mean follow up time was 7.11\u2009\u00b1\u20091.42 (5-10)\u2009years. The baseline Bhalla score was 9.52\u2009\u00b1\u20093.14 (4-19), and the change of Bhalla score was 0.55\u2009\u00b1\u20091.14 (-2 to 5). The Bhalla score was increased in 56 patients (36.1%) but not in 99 patients (63.9%). The Bhalla score change was significantly associated with the age at diagnosis (p\u2009=\u20090.037), body mass index (BMI, p\u2009=\u20090.012), chronic infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p\u2009=\u20090.005) or isolation of nontuberculous mycobacterium (p\u2009=\u20090.042) in respiratory specimens. In a multivariate analysis, BMI and isolation of P.\u2009aeruginosa were significantly related with the Bhalla score change.\nThe radiologic progression of non-CF bronchiectasis was associated with lower BMI and isolation of P.\u2009aeruginosa in respiratory specimens.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003473","authors":["Park, Jisoo","Kim, Sejoong","Lee, Yeon Joo","Park, Jong Sun","Cho, Young-Jae","Yoon, Ho Il","Lee, Kyoung-Won","Lee, Choon-Taek","Lee, Jae Ho","Cho, Young\u2010Jae","Lee, Kyoung\u2010won","Lee, Choon\u2010Taek"],"doi":"10.1111\/resp.12768","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-03-22T10:33:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1440-1843"],"issue":"6","journal":"Respirology","last_mentioned_on":1459203692,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26997422?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/resp.12768\/abstract?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/resp.12768\/pdf","pmid":"26997422","pubdate":"2016-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Factors associated with radiologic progression of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis during long-term follow-up","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factors-associated-radiologic-progression-noncystic-fibrosis-bronchiectasis-during-longterm-followup"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7452554,"mean":6.4746174952351,"rank":1585154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5859041,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7452554,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276507,"mean":10.983543380613,"rank":77371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":198577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276507,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1129,"mean":6.1884804964539,"rank":252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":873,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1129,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":20.451666666667,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AR":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NTM_papers\/statuses\/712224322849345536","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6258316],"posted_on":"2016-03-22T10:28:05+00:00","author":{"name":"NTM-Papers","url":"http:\/\/www.ntm-net.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/556077140546834432\/IysSZZGo_normal.jpeg","description":"Publications related to Nontuberculous mycobacteria.","id_on_source":"NTM_papers","tweeter_id":"2981035635","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":76},"tweet_id":"712224322849345536"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pseudo_papers\/statuses\/712339101236600832","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6258316],"posted_on":"2016-03-22T18:04:11+00:00","author":{"name":"pseudomonaspapers","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=pseudomonas","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/570219565901029376\/j3RfXxUz_normal.jpeg","description":"PubMed search bot for pseudomonas.
