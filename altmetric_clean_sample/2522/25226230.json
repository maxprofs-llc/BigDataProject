An accurate, rapid, specific method has been developed for the simultaneous detection of viable E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. in milk. Two specific genes, namely, fliC from E. coli O157:H7 and invA from Salmonella spp., were selected to design primers and probes. A combined treatment containing sodium deoxycholate (SDO) and propidium monoazide (PMA) was applied to detect viable E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. only. Traditional culture methods and SDO-PMA-multiplex real-time (mRT) PCR assay were applied to determine the number of viable E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. in cell suspensions with different proportions of dead cells. These methods revealed consistent findings regarding the detected viable cells. The detection limit of the SDO-PMA-mRT-PCR assay reached 10(2) cfu\/mL for Salmonella spp. and 10(2) cfu\/mL for E. coli O157:H7 in milk. The detection limit of SDO-PMA-mRT-PCR for E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. in milk was significantly similar even in the presence of 10(6) cfu\/mL of 2 nontarget bacteria. The proposed SDO-PMA-mRT-PCR assay is a potential approach for the accurate and sensitive detection of viable E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. in milk.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d4a","authors":["Baoqing Zhou","Taobo Liang","Zhongxu Zhan","Rui Liu","Fan Li","Hengyi Xu"],"doi":"10.3168\/jds.2017-13362","first_seen_on":"2017-09-14T04:11:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00220302"],"journal":"Journal of Dairy Science","last_mentioned_on":1507022537,"links":["http:\/\/www.journalofdairyscience.org\/article\/S0022-0302(17)30808-1\/fulltext?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.journalofdairyscience.org\/article\/S0022-0302(17)30808-1\/abstract"],"pmid":"28865862","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Rapid and simultaneous quantification of viable Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. in milk through multiplex real-time PCR","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.8,"score_history":{"1y":2.8,"6m":2.8,"3m":2.8,"1m":2.8,"1w":1.95,"6d":1.95,"5d":1.95,"4d":1.95,"3d":1.95,"2d":1.95,"1d":1.7,"at":2.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8463610,"mean":7.1088829460262,"rank":3380080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5082664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8463610,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154941,"mean":11.855005331096,"rank":51064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":103839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154941,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4003,"mean":2.7978790604698,"rank":1275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":2725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4003,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":1.317074829932,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EmilioLegaz\/statuses\/915105935294648320","license":"gnip","rt":["jdairyscience"],"citation_ids":[25226230],"posted_on":"2017-10-03T06:47:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Emilio Legaz","url":"https:\/\/www.zoetis.es\/especialistasennovillas\/index.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/821374608779702272\/48pvDwua_normal.jpg","description":"Area Business Manager en Zoetis\/\/ Doctor en Veterinaria\/\/ Especialista en Rumiantes","id_on_source":"EmilioLegaz","tweeter_id":"821363486118776832","geo":{"lt":40.42526,"ln":-3.69063,"country":"ES"},"followers":183},"tweet_id":"915105935294648320"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jdairyscience\/statuses\/908181302603423744","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25226230],"posted_on":"2017-09-14T04:11:10+00:00","author":{"name":"JournalDairyScience","url":"http:\/\/www.journalofdairyscience.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/576923487878537216\/GRt9FLAb_normal.jpeg","description":"The world's leading peer-reviewed general dairy research journal.
