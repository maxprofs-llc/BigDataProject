That research suggests that children are more likely to benefit from informal kinship-based fostering in cultural contexts where fostering expands the pool of relatives rather than substituting one parent for another, fostering is expected to provide children with positive opportunities for learning and development, and\/or children are granted some autonomy or decision-making power. However, informal kinship-based fostering seems to place children at risk in cultural contexts where the process of children's attachment to caregivers resembles the Western child development model, communities are highly stratified along socioeconomic lines, and\/or exploitation of children is permitted. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for both research and policy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5203cf058f610003a61","authors":["Jessaca Leinaweaver"],"doi":"10.1111\/cdep.12075","first_seen_on":"2017-09-14T00:55:05+00:00","issns":["17508592"],"issue":"3","journal":"Child Development Perspectives","last_mentioned_on":1505362819,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4788099\/"],"pmcid":"PMC4788099","pmid":"26973709","pubdate":"2014-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"NIH Public Access","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"131","title":"Informal Kinship-Based Fostering Around the World: Anthropological Findings","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/informal-kinshipbased-fostering-around-world-anthropological-findings"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":1.85,"3m":1.85,"1m":1.85,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":3783525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4537839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128212,"mean":11.785973091233,"rank":51737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":74370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128212,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":323,"mean":6.4902732919255,"rank":213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":323,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":4.1958333333333,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
