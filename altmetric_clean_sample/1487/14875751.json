However, to date no method has been reported to prepare monodisperse vesosomes of controlled size. Here we report on a multi-step microfluidic strategy for hierarchically assembling uniform vesosomes from dewetting of double emulsion templates. The exquisite control afforded by our method is illustrated by the for-mation of concentric, pericentric and multicompartment liposomes. The microfluidic route to vesosomes offers an exceptional platform to build artificial cells as exemplified by the in vitro transcription in \"nucleus\" liposomes and the mimicry of the architecture of eukaryotic cells. Finally, we show the transport of small molecules across the nucleic envelope via insertion of nanopores into the bilayers.","altmetric_jid":"figshare","authors":["Nan-Nan, Deng","Maaruthy, Yelleswarapu","Lifei, Zheng","Wilhelm, T.
