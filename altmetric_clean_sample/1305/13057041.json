Four of the eight triangular faces of the cuboctahedron are capped by acetylide groups in \u03bc3 \u2005fashion, and each of the six square faces is bridged by a dithiolate ligand in \u03bc2 ,\u03bc2 fashion, which leads to a truncated tetrahedron of twelve sulfur atoms. DFT calculations are fully consistent with the description of these Cu13 clusters as two-electron superatoms, that is, a [Cu13 ](11+) core passivated by ten monoanionic ligands, with an a1 HOMO containing two 1S jellium electrons.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Chakrahari, Kiran Kumarvarma","Liao, Jian\u2010Hong","Kahlal, Samia","Liu, Yu\u2010Chiao","Chiang, Ming\u2010Hsi","Saillard, Jean\u2010Yves","Liu, C.
