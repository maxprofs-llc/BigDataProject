Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the established reference for imaging of RV volumes, mass and function. We sought to define the impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) upon RV function in patients treated for severe aortic stenosis using CMR.\nA 1.5T CMR scan was performed preoperatively and 6months postoperatively in 112 (56 TAVI, 56 SAVR; 76\u00b18years) high-risk severe symptomatic aortic stenosis patients across two UK cardiothoracic centres.\nTAVI patients were older (80.4\u00b16.7 vs. 72.8\u00b17.2years, p<0.05) with a higher STS score (2.13\u00b10.73 vs. 5.54\u00b13.41%, p<0.001). At 6months, SAVR was associated with a significant increase in RV end systolic volume (33\u00b110 vs. 37\u00b110ml\/m(2), p=0.008), and decrease in RV ejection fraction (58\u00b18 vs. 53\u00b18%, p=0.005) and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (22\u00b15 vs. 14\u00b13mm, p<0.001). Only 4 (7%) SAVR patients had new RV late gadolinium hyper-enhancement with no new cases seen in the TAVI patients at 6months. Longer surgical cross-clamp time was the only predictor of increased RV end systolic volume at 6months. Post-TAVI, there was no observed change in RV volumes or function. Over a maximum 6.3year follow-up, 18(32%) of TAVI patients and 1(1.7%) of SAVR patients had died (p=0.001). On multivariable Cox analysis, the RV mass at 6m post-TAVI was independently associated with all-cause mortality (HR 1.359, 95% CI 1.108-1.666, p=0.003).\nSAVR results in a deterioration in RV systolic volumes and function associated with longer cross-clamp times and is not fully explained by suboptimal RV protection during cardiopulmonary bypass. TAVI had no adverse impact upon RV volumes or function.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b29","authors":["Musa, Tarique Al","Uddin, Akhlaque","Fairbairn, Timothy A","Dobson, Laura E","Steadman, Christopher D","Kidambi, Ananth","Ripley, David P","Swoboda, Peter P","McDiarmid, Adam K","Erhayiem, Bara","Garg, Pankaj","Blackman, Daniel J","Plein, Sven","McCann, Gerald P","Greenwood, John P"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijcard.2016.08.065","endpage":"644","first_seen_on":"2016-10-26T15:03:40+00:00","funders":["bhf"],"issns":["1874-1754","01675273"],"journal":"International Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1477494194,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27565842"],"pmid":"27565842","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"639","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Right ventricular function following surgical aortic valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve implantation: A cardiovascular MR study","type":"article","volume":"223","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/right-ventricular-function-following-surgical-aortic-valve-replacement-transcatheter-aortic-valve-im-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7596091,"mean":6.5461949734624,"rank":3926895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2128903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7596091,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235334,"mean":12.670479116826,"rank":129130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":83556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235334,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3413,"mean":2.9847327080891,"rank":1241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3413,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":372,"mean":4.0101185983827,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":372,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/unileedscardio\/statuses\/791294120211906564","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13057721],"posted_on":"2016-10-26T15:03:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Leeds Cardiovascular","url":"http:\/\/www.cardiovascular.leeds.ac.uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/750608489769234432\/IpSFy990_normal.jpg","description":"Advancing understanding of cardiovascular disease with the aim to improve human life.\nhttp:\/\/www.cardiovascular.leeds.ac.uk","id_on_source":"unileedscardio","tweeter_id":"750352089075871746","geo":{"lt":53.79648,"ln":-1.54785,"country":"GB"},"followers":669},"tweet_id":"791294120211906564"}]}}
