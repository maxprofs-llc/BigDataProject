A total of 135 and 100 C. albicans strains were isolated from superficial surfaces of MS patients and healthy controls. Analytical models (regression and neural network) were applied to predict the severity of MS considering specific enzyme activity (SEA) and other factors which affect the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). The SEA of C. albicans in MS patients (3466.95 \u00b1 277.25 \u03bcmol min(-1) mg(-1) ) was significantly more than that of healthy controls (1108.98 \u00b1 294.51 \u03bcmol min(-1) mg(-1) ) that was confirmed by regression model (P < 0.001). The SEA had a positive correlation with the severity of MS (P < 0.001, r = 0.65). Analytical models showed that SEA played the most important role (among all included factors that affect on EDSS) in the severity of MS. The SEA of C. albicans in MS patients was significantly more than the healthy controls. The results suggest that the level of SEA of proteinase A and probably the capacity of C. albicans isolates to invade the host tissue is associated with the severity of MS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003140","authors":["Shahla Amri Saroukolaei","Mojdeh Ghabaee","Hojjatollah Shokri","Alireza Badiei","Shadi Ghourchian"],"doi":"10.1111\/myc.12489","first_seen_on":"2017-04-01T03:58:19+00:00","issns":["09337407"],"journal":"Mycoses","last_mentioned_on":1491019086,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27061227?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27061227","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"The role ofCandida albicansin the severity of multiple sclerosis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-candida-albicans-severity-multiple-sclerosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":7297852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249979,"mean":13.192901519333,"rank":206873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249979,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":503,"mean":2.0002948207171,"rank":386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":503,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.1988888888889,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/statuses\/848021627010928641","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18374032],"posted_on":"2017-04-01T03:58:06+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
