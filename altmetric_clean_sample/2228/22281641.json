Concordance correlation and Passing-Bablok regression were used to compare the validity of eGFRckdepi and eGFRmodified. Bias, precision and accuracy were compared to identify which equation showed the better performance in determining GFR.\nA total of 170 patients were enrolled. Both eGFRckdepi and eGFRmodified correlated well with mGFR (concordance correlation coefficient 0.90 and 0.74, respectively) and the Passing-Bablok regression equation of eGFRckdepi and eGFRmodified against mGFR was mGFR\u00a0=\u00a00.37\u00a0+\u00a01.04 eGFRckdepi and -49.25\u00a0+\u00a01.74 eGFRmodified, respectively. In terms of bias, precision and 30\u00a0% accuracy, eGFRmodified showed a worse performance compared to eGFRckdepi, in the whole cohort.\nThe new modified CKD-EPI equation cannot replace the original CKD-EPI equation in determining GFR in Chinese patients with CKD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e41","authors":["Peng Xie","Jian-min Huang","Ying Li","Huai-jun Liu","Yan Qu"],"doi":"10.1007\/s40620-016-0307-4","first_seen_on":"2017-07-22T20:39:36+00:00","issns":["1121-8428","1724-6059"],"journal":"JN: Journal of Nephrology","last_mentioned_on":1500756132,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s40620-016-0307-4"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs40620-016-0307-4.pdf","pmid":"27068829","pubdate":"2016-04-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nephrology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Urology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"The modified CKD-EPI equation may be not more accurate than CKD-EPI equation in determining glomerular filtration rate in Chinese patients with chronic kidney disease","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317032,"mean":7.0082271163749,"rank":6014036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2005982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317032,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196518,"mean":12.077052712997,"rank":127772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":57004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196518,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283,"mean":2.2990425531915,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.8285714285714,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/set_fortess\/statuses\/888861061285367808","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22281641],"posted_on":"2017-07-22T20:39:25+00:00","author":{"name":"soda_troubles","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/711632574343421952\/_Wb_UpPy_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"set_fortess","tweeter_id":"1106903606","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":466},"tweet_id":"888861061285367808"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pianiste13\/statuses\/888861759741849600","license":"gnip","rt":["set_fortess"],"citation_ids":[22281641],"posted_on":"2017-07-22T20:42:12+00:00","author":{"name":"\u2624| \u01f7\u026a\u0310\u1d43\u1db0\u1d52..\u2765\u266a'","url":"https:\/\/pianiste13.sarahah.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/880769171293974528\/MXGeXIEG_normal.jpg","description":"\u0635\u064a\u062f\u0644\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0625\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0649 Asso\u03c2iate Professor at PNU \u0633\u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0644\u0625\u0633\u0645\u064a \u0628\u0635\u0645\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u062e\u0635\u0635\u064a \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0644\u064a \u0628\u0635\u0645\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0642\u0644\u0648\u0628\u0643\u0645\u060c\u062a\u0639\u0648\u062f\u062a \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0642\u0642 \u0623\u0647\u062f\u0627\u0641\u064a\u060c \u0648\u0623\u0646 \u0644\u0627\u0645\u0633\u062a\u062d\u064a\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u062d\u064a\u0627\u062a\u064a~\u2765\"","id_on_source":"pianiste13","tweeter_id":"1621433923","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2819},"tweet_id":"888861759741849600"}]}}
