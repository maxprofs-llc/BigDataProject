Both groups experienced four conditions of visual input: low-frequency (0.20Hz) visual oscillations, high-frequency (0.60Hz) oscillations, multifrequency nonpredictable visual input, and no imposed visual information. Analyses of the frequency content of anterior-posterior (AP) sway revealed that postural reactions to the single-frequency conditions replicated previous findings; children were responsive to low- and high-frequency oscillations, whereas adults were responsive to low-frequency information. Extending previous work, AP sway in response to the nonpredictable condition revealed that both groups were responsive to the different components contained in the multifrequency visual information, although adults retained their frequency selectivity to low-frequency versus high-frequency content. These findings are discussed in relation to work examining feedback versus feedforward control of posture, and the reweighting of sensory inputs for postural control, as a function of development and task context.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002d98","authors":["Schmuckler, Mark A."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jecp.2017.06.005","first_seen_on":"2017-07-23T02:35:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0022-0965","00220965","1096-0457"],"journal":"Journal of Experimental Child Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1500777337,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0022096517304009"],"pmid":"28738310","pubdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology","pediatrics"],"title":"Postural response to predictable and nonpredictable visual flow in children and adults","type":"article","volume":"163","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/postural-response-predictable-nonpredictable-visual-flow-children-adults"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8261086,"mean":6.9752528681095,"rank":7144920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8261086,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168314,"mean":11.549546594737,"rank":137303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168314,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":830,"mean":7.5646899879373,"rank":728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":830,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":6.2413684210526,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/uranus_2\/statuses\/888950698930388992","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22284711],"posted_on":"2017-07-23T02:35:37+00:00","author":{"name":"\u30de\u30fc\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30fc\uff12\u4e16","url":"http:\/\/smetc.blog120.fc2.com\/?sp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/650483455248064512\/EOJq3sZX_normal.png","description":"\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u3068\u3082\u5927\u5b66\u521d\u5e74\u6b21\u307e\u3067\u306f\u5834\u9762\u7dd8\u9ed9\u75c7\uff08\u81ea\u5df1\u8a3a\u65ad\uff09\u3060\u3063\u305f\u7537\u3002Twitter\u307e\u3068\u3081(http:\/\/psychobrain.seesaa.net\/)\u3002 \u6ce8\u610f\u4e8b\u9805\u2460\u8ad6\u6587\u306f\u8981\u7d04\u3057\u304b\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u3044\u306a\u3044\u5834\u5408\u304c\u591a\u3044\u2461\u9593\u9055\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3042\u308a\u2462\u79c1\u306f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002","id_on_source":"uranus_2","tweeter_id":"253847599","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3414},"tweet_id":"888950698930388992"}]}}
