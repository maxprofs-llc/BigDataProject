The ability to predict the growth of fibroids could help clinicians decide, with their patients, the need for treatment. For example, asymptomatic women with fibroids detected incidentally may require follow up if these fibroids are predicted to have a high growth rate. In women of reproductive age, fast-growing fibroids located in a submucous or intramural position may subsequently impair fertility and so early surgical removal should be considered. Medical treatments such as ulipristal acetate, can prevent growth of fibroids and so may be indicated in women with fast growing fibroids. This article is protected by copyright.
