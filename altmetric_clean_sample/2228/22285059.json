Data were collected from the record files of the hospital.\nFrom 2010 to 2013, there were 18 patients reported to have dapsone ADRs, with an occurrence rate of 0.82% in the 4-year duration. The maximum incidence of ADRs (1.043%) was in 2010 and the minimum incidence of ADRs (0.26%) was in 2013. Among two types of bacterial infections, 94.44% were of multibacillary and 5.56% were of paucibacillary type. The age range of patients with dapsone ADRs was 11-68 years. The male-to-female ratio was 1.25. The onset of dapsone ADRs after taking MDT was within a minimum of 3 weeks and a maximum of 21 weeks. There were 14 (77.77%) patients who presented with jaundice, 8 (44.44%) with exfoliative dermatitis, 5 (27.77%) with hemolytic anemia and 4 (22.22%) with fever and headache. The rare side effects (5.5%) found were agranulocytosis or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Three patients were cured; some were still on the treatment. Four patients died with dapsone ADRs.\nThe common dapsone ADRs present in leprosy patients were jaundice, exfoliative dermatitis and hemolytic anemia in MDT-treated patients. Patients could be cured by managing the dapsone ADRs effectively on time. Some patients may die of dapsone ADRs if clinicians fail to manage the side effects on time.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbf8","authors":["Guragain, Sanjeev","Upadhayay, Namrata","Bhattarai, Bishwa","Sanjeev Guragain","Namrata Upadhayay","Bishwa Mohan Bhattarai"],"doi":"10.2147\/cpaa.s135846","first_seen_on":"2017-07-23T03:54:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1179-1438"],"journal":"Clinical Pharmacology : Advances and Applications","last_mentioned_on":1502714658,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28721106\/","https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/adverse-reactions-in-leprosy-patients-who-underwent-dapsone-multidrug--peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CPAA","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5500492\/pdf\/cpaa-9-073.pdf"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=37191","pmcid":"PMC5500492","pmid":"28721106","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Medical Press Ltd.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"73","title":"Adverse reactions in leprosy patients who underwent dapsone multidrug therapy: a retrospective study","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adverse-reactions-leprosy-patients-underwent-dapsone-multidrug-therapy-retrospective-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":2.5,"6m":2.5,"3m":2.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":3419627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4893787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213532,"mean":12.831085715891,"rank":77685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":134070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213532,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":2.400989010989,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.85,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1,"SE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Phelix_RD\/statuses\/888970450788909057","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22285059],"posted_on":"2017-07-23T03:54:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Phelix","url":"http:\/\/phelix.info","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/691347536083341313\/XK39Fmmk_normal.jpg","description":"Research Charity focused on treatments to cure chronic infections inducing neurodegenerescence (ASD,ADHD.TBD & ALZ) & alternative to antibiotics: bacteriophages","id_on_source":"Phelix_RD","tweeter_id":"2888241478","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1850},"tweet_id":"888970450788909057"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ArminLabs\/statuses\/895036774233276416","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22285059],"posted_on":"2017-08-08T21:39:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Armin Schwarzbach","url":"http:\/\/www.arminlabs.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/609461481361567745\/Ar--dzAX_normal.jpg","description":"Specialized #lymedisease #Borreliose #ticks #coinfections #tickbornediseases #EliSpot #Tickplex","id_on_source":"ArminLabs","tweeter_id":"3321662363","geo":{"lt":49,"ln":11.5,"country":"DE"},"followers":887},"tweet_id":"895036774233276416"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/angelic75695423\/statuses\/895037186172755969","license":"gnip","rt":["ArminLabs"],"citation_ids":[22285059],"posted_on":"2017-08-08T21:41:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Angelica Johansson","url":"http:\/\/botaborrelia.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/794384497110302725\/KcdzXeuL_normal.jpg","description":"Founder and President of VIDAS.\n\nDelegate of Global Network On Institutionalized Discrimination\n\nLyme Advocate GLliO.\n\nF.Pres. of Lyme Ass.
