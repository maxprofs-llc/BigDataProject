Dried blood spot (DBS) use, which was introduced in the latest World Health Organization recommendations, can overcome these difficulties. This evaluation aimed at validating VL measurement in DBS, in a laboratory without previous DBS experience and in routine testing conditions. Methods. \u2003Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults were observed in a HIV care site in Hanoi, and each patient provided 2 DBS cards with whole blood spots and 2 plasma samples. Viral load was measured in DBS and in plasma using the COBAS Ampliprep\/TaqMan and the Abbott RealTime assays. To correctly identify those with VL \u2265 1000 copies\/mL, sensitivity and specificity were estimated. Results. \u2003A total of 198 patients were enrolled. With the Roche technique, 51 plasma VL were \u22651000 copies\/mL; among these, 28 presented a VL in DBS that was also \u22651000 copies\/mL (sensitivity, 54.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 40.3-68.9). On the other hand, all plasma VL < 1000 copies\/mL were also <1000 copies\/mL in DBS (specificity, 100; 95% CI, 97.5-100). With the Abbott technique, 45 plasma VL were \u22651000 copies\/mL; among these, 42 VL in DBS were also \u22651000 copies\/mL (sensitivity, 93.3%; 95% CI, 81.7-98.6); specificity was 94.8 (95% CI, 90.0-97.7). Conclusions. \u2003The Abbott RealTime polymerase chain reaction assay provided adequate VL results in DBS, thus allowing DBS use for VL monitoring.","altmetric_jid":"554b86a12a83ee864e8b45e5","authors":["Fabien Taieb","Tran Hong Tram","Hien Thi Ho","Van Anh Pham","Lan Nguyen","Ban Hien Pham","Linh An Tong","Edouard Tuaillon","Eric Delaporte","Anh Tuan Nguyen","Duc Duong Bui","NhanThi Do","Yoann Madec"],"doi":"10.1093\/ofid\/ofw142","first_seen_on":"2016-10-15T20:50:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2328-8957"],"issue":"3","journal":"Open Forum Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1478077012,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5047401\/"],"pmid":"27704001","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","startpage":"ofw142","title":"Evaluation of Two Techniques for Viral Load Monitoring Using Dried Blood Spot in Routine Practice in Vietnam (French National Agency for AIDS and Hepatitis Research 12338)","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-two-techniques-viral-load-monitoring-using-dried-blood-spot-routine-practice-vietnam-fren"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451417,"mean":7.1044089350157,"rank":6412640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1149036,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451417,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252085,"mean":12.693777748687,"rank":175413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":46213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252085,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":532,"mean":8.8322109227872,"rank":387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":532,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":5.4571428571429,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
