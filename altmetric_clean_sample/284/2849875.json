Carboxyl functionalized CdSe quantum dots (CF-CdSe QDs) were successfully bonded onto TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs), which could significantly improve the photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of TiO2 NPs. This is ascribed to the fact that CdSe QDs with a narrow band gap could be stimulated under visible light irradiation, and the energy levels of TiO2 NPs and CF-CdSe QDs are aligned with an electrolyte solution. High resolution transmission electron microscopy images revealed the heterostructures of the TiO2-CdSe composites. Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy, photoluminescence emission spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis exhibited that the prepared TiO2-CdSe heterostructures have improved light absorption, charge separation efficiency and electron transfer ability in the visible light region. TiO2-CdSe heterostructures were used as versatile labels for fabrication of PEC and electrochemical immunosensors, and human immune globulin G (HIgG) was used as a model analyte. The immunosensor showed high sensitivity, a low detection limit and a wide linear range, which could be applied in practical serum sample analysis. The constructed TiO2-CdSe heterostructures would have potential applications in photocatalysis, aptasensors, cytosensors and other areas of nanotechnology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Picheng Gao","Hongmin Ma","Tao Yan","Dan Wu","Xiang Ren","Jiaojiao Yang","Bin Du","Qin Wei"],"doi":"10.1039\/c4dt02576h","endpage":"781","first_seen_on":"2014-11-04T13:56:56+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"2","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1415903847,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2014\/DT\/C4DT02576H","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/DT\/C4DT02576H"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2014\/dt\/c4dt02576h","pmid":"25408238","pubdate":"2014-12-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"773","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Construction of dentate bonded TiO2\u2013CdSe heterostructures with enhanced photoelectrochemical properties: versatile labels toward photoelectrochemical and electrochemical sensing","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/construction-dentate-bonded-tio2cdse-heterostructures-enhanced-photoelectrochemical-properties-versa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":2874329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1470087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125964,"mean":8.6482875923886,"rank":77225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":43463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125964,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992,"mean":0.69031810787136,"rank":1754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":5762,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.1357142857143,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
