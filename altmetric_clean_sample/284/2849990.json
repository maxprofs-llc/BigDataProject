This limitation is circumvented with two recent technical advancements: the modified Cornish pasty culture and whole-embryo transplantation. The former supports optimal ex ovo growth till stage HH18, and the latter allows ex-ovo-manipulated embryos to have long-term in ovo-survivability. Here we provide step-by-step instructions for both methods. These two new techniques can also be combined to achieve targeted labeling, imaging and electroporation in early-stage embryos ex ovo, and phenotypic and functional analyses at more advanced developmental stages in ovo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037b7","authors":["Nagai H","Sezaki M","Nakamura H","Sheng G"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ymeth.2013.05.005","first_seen_on":"2014-11-04T14:31:57+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Methods","last_mentioned_on":1415094060,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ymeth.2013.05.005"],"pmid":"23707610","pubdate":"2013-05-29T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Extending the limits of avian embryo culture with the modified Cornish pasty and whole-embryo transplantation methods.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extending-limits-avian-embryo-culture-modified-cornish-pasty-wholeembryo-transplantation-methods"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.184,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.184},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4466662,"mean":4.7856920109675,"rank":691400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3774901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4466662,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125261,"mean":7.6398959604024,"rank":25040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":100217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125261,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":641,"mean":2.14474375,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":641,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":0.82692307692308,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
