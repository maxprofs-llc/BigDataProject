Recently, both non-ablative and ablative fractional laser (NFL and AFL) systems have attracted attention as potential therapies for the revision of thyroidectomy scars. The present split-scar study was designed to directly compare the efficacy of these two methods for the treatment of post-thyroidectomy scars.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007fef","authors":["Shin, Jung U","Gantsetseg, Dorjsuren","Jung, Jin Young","Jung, Inhee","Shin, Sungsik","Lee, Ju Hee"],"doi":"10.1002\/lsm.22297","endpage":"749","first_seen_on":"2014-11-03T18:23:04+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1096-9101","0196-8092"],"issue":"10","journal":"Lasers in Surgery and Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1417009617,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/lsm.22297\/abstract;jsessionid=7A43C424A7D426687C983D7051F57A43.f02t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/lsm.22297&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25367640"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/lsm.22297\/pdf","pmid":"25367640","pubdate":"2014-11-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"741","subjects":["medicine","generalsurgery"],"title":"Comparison of non-ablative and ablative fractional laser treatments in a postoperative scar study.","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-nonablative-ablative-fractional-laser-treatments-postoperative-scar-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7918051,"mean":6.6979415254961,"rank":6003873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1063049,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7918051,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202863,"mean":7.839358756199,"rank":132909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":39758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202863,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":465,"mean":5.7011551724138,"rank":307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":465,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":3.2192307692308,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
