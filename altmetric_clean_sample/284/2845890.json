In addition to reduced life expectancy, men can also expect to live fewer healthy years than their female counterparts. As gynecologists and obstetricians have led the women's health movement in addressing gender-specific gaps in care, urologists are well-poised to take on a leadership role to advocate for, and address, men's health initiatives.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5203cf058f610003a27","authors":["S.
