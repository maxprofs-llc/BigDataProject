The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and place in therapy of nebivolol are reviewed. SUMMARY. Nebivolol, a third-generation, highly \u03b2(1)-specific \u03b2-blocker, is labeled for the treatment of hypertension in the United States. In addition to its \u03b2-blocking effects, nebivolol has been shown to increase endothelin-dependent nitric oxide, giving it a unique peripheral vasodilatory action. Nebivolol is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme 2D6. In patients with heart failure, certain \u03b2-blockers antagonize excessive adrenergic stimulation and can slow the progression of the disease. Clinical trials have compared nebivolol at target dosages of 5 and 10 mg once daily with placebo and, in small trials, with carvedilol in the treatment of adults with chronic heart failure. Nebivolol appears to have beneficial effects in patients with heart failure, including improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular volumes, and exercise capacity. In addition, the Study of the Effects of Nebivolol Intervention on Outcomes and Rehospitalisation in Seniors with Heart Failure showed a reduction in morbidity and mortality after treatment with nebivolol when compared with placebo, though this effect appeared to be less than that of other \u03b2-blockers currently recommended for the treatment of heart failure. Nebivolol was well tolerated in all clinical trials, with the most frequently reported adverse events including bradycardia, hypotension, and dizziness. To date, no large clinical trials have compared nebivolol with currently recommended \u03b2-blockers in patients with heart failure. CONCLUSION. Nebivolol has beneficial effects in heart failure but cannot be considered equivalent to other currently accepted therapies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021fe","authors":["Allison S.
