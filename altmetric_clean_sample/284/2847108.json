Morphological diversity existed in and among the populations, even within the progeny nematodes from single nematodes compared to that of 30 females. The labial disc shape, the number of head annuli, the terminated position of lateral lips, the number of genital papillae before cloacal apertures and female and male tail terminal shape showed variation. In addition, genital papillae arranged in a double row before cloacal apertures was first found in two ornamental populations. The karyotype of all the 20 populations was n = 5. Combining our results and previous studies, we support that Radopholuscitrophilus is a synonym of Radopholussimilis, and that it is not possible to distinguish physiological races or pathotypes of Radopholussimilis according to morphological characters or karyotype.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53d3cf058f610004744","authors":["Xu CL","Li Y","Xie H","Huang X","Wu WJ","Yu L","Wang DW"],"doi":"10.3897\/zookeys.444.8186","first_seen_on":"2014-11-03T23:11:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1313-2989"],"issue":"444","journal":"ZooKeys","last_mentioned_on":1415056269,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25349501"],"pmcid":"PMC4205733","pmid":"25349501","pubdate":"2014-10-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Morphological and karyotypic differences within and among populations of Radopholussimilis.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/morphological-karyotypic-differences-within-among-populations-radopholus-similis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3057496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":929798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125843,"mean":8.5125611322136,"rank":83714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":30087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125843,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1456,"mean":11.463775945017,"rank":1118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1456,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":6.49875,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
