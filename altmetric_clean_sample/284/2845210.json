Specifically, this paper explores the links between two well-known 'language-related' genes like FOXP2 and ROBO1 implicated in vocal learning and the initial set of genes of interest put forth in Boeckx and Ben\u00edtez-Burraco (2014), with RUNX2 as focal point. Relying on the existing literature, we uncover potential molecular links that could be of interest to future experimental inquiries into the biological foundations of language and the testing of our initial hypothesis. Our discussion could also be relevant for clinical linguistics and for the interpretation of results from paleogenomics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc1b","authors":["Boeckx, Cedric","Ben\u00edtez-Burraco, Antonio"],"doi":"10.3389\/fpsyg.2014.01324","first_seen_on":"2014-11-03T10:41:58+00:00","issns":["1664-1078",""],"journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1479854343,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2014.01324\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25505436?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2014.01324\/full"],"pmcid":"PMC4243498","pmid":"25505436","pubdate":"2014-10-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Globularity and language-readiness: Generating new predictions by expanding the set of genes of interest","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/globularity-languagereadiness-generating-new-predictions-expanding-set-genes-interest"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.75,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7724913,"mean":6.6254088328702,"rank":697080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7023836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7724913,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202016,"mean":7.8168659752991,"rank":23047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":178775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202016,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7070,"mean":10.637625406705,"rank":1209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":5852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7070,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293,"mean":14.67945890411,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
