A sequential, open-label, two-period pharmacokinetic interaction design was used. 12 healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of fexofenadine (60\u2009mg) followed by danshen ethanol extract (1\u2009g orally, three times a day) for 10 days, after which they received 1\u2009g of the danshen extract with fexofenadine (60\u2009mg) on the last day. The plasma concentrations of fexofenadine was measured by LC-MS\/MS. After 10 days of the danshen extract administration, the mean AUC and C max\u2061 of the fexofenadine was decreased by 37.2% and 27.4% compared with the control, respectively. The mean clearance of fexofenadine was increased by 104.9%. The in vitro study showed that tanshinone IIA and cryptotanshinone could induce MDR1 mRNA. This study showed that multidose administration of danshen ethanol extract could increase oral clearance of fexofenadine. The increased oral clearance of fexofenadine is attributable to induction of intestinal P-glycoprotein.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c64","authors":["Qiu, Furong"],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/473213","first_seen_on":"2014-11-03T13:03:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1741-427X"],"journal":"Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)","last_mentioned_on":1415020239,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2014\/473213\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2014\/473213.pdf","pmid":"25538791","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Effects of Danshen Ethanol Extract on the Pharmacokinetics of Fexofenadine in Healthy Volunteers","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-danshen-ethanol-extract-pharmacokinetics-fexofenadine-healthy-volunteers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2645663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2367311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144912,"mean":8.7512860307363,"rank":74340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":69759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144912,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3224,"mean":3.7747179646292,"rank":1365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":1806,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3224,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.504,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/siewlee1818\/status\/529259360867090432","license":"datasift","rt":["MBHolistic"],"citation_ids":[2845524],"posted_on":"2014-11-03T13:10:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Reverse Diabetes","url":"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/mj55o7o","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/488277239830573056\/N8xIxGm4_normal.jpeg","description":"Information and news on Diabetes.
