In particular, admixture mapping is an efficient approach to identifying genetic basis for those complex diseases with substantial racial or ethnic disparities. Though current advances in admixture mapping algorithms may utilize the entire panel of SNPs, providing ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) that can differentiate parental populations and estimate ancestry proportions in an admixed population may particularly benefit admixture mapping in studies of limited samples, help identify unsuitable individuals (e.g., through genotyping the most informative ancestry markers) before starting large genome-wide association studies (GWAS), or guide larger scale targeted deep re-sequencing for determining specific disease-causing variants. Defining panels of AIMs based on commercial, high-throughput genotyping platforms will facilitate the utilization of these platforms for simultaneous admixture mapping of complex traits and diseases, in addition to conventional GWAS. Here, we describe AIMs detected based on the Shannon Information Content (SIC) or Fst for African Americans with genome-wide coverage that were selected from \u223c2.3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covered by the Affymetrix Axiom Pan-African array, a newly developed genotyping platform optimized for individuals of African ancestry.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"521f51273cf0582f62000000","authors":["Xu Zhang","Wenbo Mu","Cong Liu","Wei Zhang"],"doi":"10.7717\/peerj.660","first_seen_on":"2014-11-04T12:10:24+00:00","issns":["2167-8359"],"journal":"PeerJ","last_mentioned_on":1416523820,"links":["https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/660\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25392759?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/660.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4226639","pmid":"25392759","publisher":"PeerJ Inc.","title":"Ancestry-informative markers for African Americans based on the Affymetrix Pan-African genotyping array","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ancestryinformative-markers-african-americans-based-affymetrix-panafrican-genotyping-array"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5028713,"mean":5.9653160399705,"rank":1998024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":2993995,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5028713,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146415,"mean":8.7032653981181,"rank":50312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":94459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146415,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1965,"mean":21.355186354379,"rank":1375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1965,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122,"mean":23.145074380165,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
