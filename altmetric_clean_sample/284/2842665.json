Images were evaluated by means of visual read by either moderately-skilled or expert readers, and by means of a summary metric of AD-like hypometabolism (PALZ score). Seventy-seven patients converted to AD-dementia after 28.6 \u00b1 19.3 months of follow-up. Expert reading was the most accurate tool to detect these MCI converters from healthy controls (sensitivity 89.6%, specificity 89.0%, accuracy 89.2%) while two moderately-skilled readers were less (p < 0.05) specific (sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 79.8%, accuracy 82.3%) and PALZ score was less (p < 0.001) sensitive (sensitivity 62.3%, specificity 91.7%, accuracy 79.6%). Among the remaining 67 aMCI patients, 50 were confirmed as aMCI after an average of 42.3 months, 12 developed other dementia, and 3 reverted to normalcy. In 30\/50 persistent MCI patients, the expert recognized the AD hypometabolic pattern. In 13\/50 aMCI, both the expert and PALZ score were negative while in 7\/50, only the PALZ score was positive due to sparse hypometabolic clusters mainly in frontal lobes. Visual FDG-PET reads by an expert is the most accurate method but an automated, validated system may be particularly helpful to moderately-skilled readers because of high specificity, and should be mandatory when even a moderately-skilled reader is unavailable.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c7a","authors":["Silvia Morbelli","Andrea Brugnolo","Irene Bossert","Ambra Buschiazzo","Giovanni B Frisoni","Samantha Galluzzi","Bart N M van Berckel","Rik Ossenkoppele","Robert Perneczky","Alexander Drzezga","Mira Didic","Eric Guedj","Gianmario Sambuceti","Gianluca Bottoni","Dario Arnaldi","Agnese Picco","Fabrizio De Carli","Marco Pagani","Flavio Nobili"],"doi":"10.3233\/jad-142229","first_seen_on":"2014-11-02T11:07:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1875-8908"],"journal":"Journal of Alzheimer's Disease","last_mentioned_on":1414928648,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25362041?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25362041?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25362041?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"25362041","pubdate":"2014-10-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["geriatrics","neurology"],"title":"Visual Versus Semi-Quantitative Analysis of 18F-FDG-PET in Amnestic MCI: An European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium (EADC) Project.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/visual-versus-semiquantitative-analysis-18ffdgpet-amnestic-mci-european-alzheimers-disease-consortiu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6561630,"mean":6.0798051118097,"rank":2711479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3700767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6561630,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170782,"mean":8.3510840901507,"rank":72227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":92910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170782,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1960,"mean":11.298481878509,"rank":1415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1960,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":9.073186440678,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
