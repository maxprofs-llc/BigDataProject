Moreover, people with MS are known to have fewer social activities and a reduced quality of life. One aspect of social interaction is accurate recognition of facial expressions. Several studies have suggested impairment in the processing of facial expressions in patients with multiple sclerosis, but it is not clear if these deficits are based on cognitive, depressive, or other attendant symptoms.\nTo investigate emotion recognition and facial identity recognition abilities and their relation with cognitive functions, depression, and fatigue in a cohort of MS patients.\nEmotion recognition and facial identity recognition abilities were investigated in a cohort of 61 MS patients with unimpaired visual acuity and 53 healthy controls using the Florida Affect Battery. Additionally, we investigated possible relationships between impaired facial expression recognition and other clinical features.\nMS patients were not impaired in facial identity discrimination, but showed a poor performance in all subtests that required emotion recognition.\nImpaired recognition of facial emotions by patients with MS seems to be associated with both cognitive and affective (depression) aspects of the disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f610008205","authors":["Berneiser, Julia","Wendt, Julia","Grothe, Matthias","Kessler, Christof","Hamm, Alfons O","Dressel, Alexander"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.msard.2014.02.001","first_seen_on":"2014-03-11T09:31:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["22110348","2211-0348","2211-0356"],"issue":"4","journal":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1403655997,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2211034814000091","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=7&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.msard-journal.com%2Farticle%2FS2211-0348%252814%252900009-1%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes%3Frss%3Dyes&code=msard-site","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.msard.2014.02.001"],"pmid":"25877060","pubdate":"2015-04-17T22:04:55+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Impaired recognition of emotional facial expressions in patients with multiple sclerosis","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impaired-recognition-emotional-facial-expressions-patients-multiple-sclerosis-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7379891,"mean":6.4116429369506,"rank":746251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":6623253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7379891,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171170,"mean":7.5065487675925,"rank":21097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":149779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171170,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":297,"mean":4.8933783783784,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":297,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":4.618,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
