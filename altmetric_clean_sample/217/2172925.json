Among Hispanic women diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), 50% will go on to develop type 2 diabetes within 5 years of the index pregnancy. Although randomised controlled trials among adults with impaired glucose tolerance have shown that diet and physical activity reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, such programs have not been tested in high-risk postpartum women. The overall goal of this randomised controlled trial is to test the efficacy of a culturally and linguistically modified, individually-tailored lifestyle intervention to reduce risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease among postpartum Hispanic women with a history of abnormal glucose tolerance during pregnancy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d5","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2393-14-100","first_seen_on":"2014-03-10T04:30:22+00:00","issns":["1471-2393"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth","last_mentioned_on":1394528920,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2393\/14\/100\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2393-14-100.pdf","pmid":"24606590","pubdate":"2014-03-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"100","subjects":["obstetrics"],"title":"Estudio Parto: postpartum diabetes prevention program for hispanic women with abnormal glucose tolerance in pregnancy: a randomised controlled trial - study protocol","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/estudio-parto-postpartum-diabetes-prevention-program-hispanic-women-abnormal-glucose-tolerance-pregn-9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":2122178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2247167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107280,"mean":8.3533069845919,"rank":47964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":55451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107280,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1125,"mean":4.8684217081851,"rank":724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1125,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":9.0147578947368,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":4,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
