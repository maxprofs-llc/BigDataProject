Understanding the underlying mechanism of tumor relapse is crucial for effective therapy of ovarian cancer. DNA damage-binding protein 2 (DDB2) is a DNA repair factor mainly involved in nucleotide excision repair. Here, a novel role was identified for DDB2 in the tumorigenesis of ovarian cancer cells and the prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer. Overexpressing DDB2 in human ovarian cancer cells suppressed its capability to recapitulate tumors in athymic nude mice. Mechanistic investigation demonstrated that DDB2 is able to reduce the cancer stem cell (CSC) population characterized with high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity in ovarian cancer cells, probably through disrupting the self-renewal capacity of CSCs. Low DDB2 expression correlates with poor outcomes among patients with ovarian cancer, as revealed from the analysis of publicly available gene expression array datasets. Given the finding that DDB2 protein expression is low in ovarian tumor cells, enhancement of DDB2 expression is a promising strategy to eradicate CSCs and would help to halt ovarian cancer relapse.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081df","authors":["Chunhua Han","Ran Zhao","Xingluo Liu","Amit Srivastava","Li Gong","Hsiaoyin Mao","Meihua Qu","Weiqiang Zhao","Jianhua Yu","Qi-En Wang","Han C","Zhao R","Liu X","Srivastava A","Gong L","Mao H","Qu M","Zhao W","Yu J","Wang QE"],"doi":"10.1158\/1541-7786.mcr-13-0638","endpage":"794","first_seen_on":"2014-03-07T20:03:41+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1557-3125","1541-7786"],"issue":"5","journal":"Molecular Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1394222614,"links":["http:\/\/mcr.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2014\/02\/25\/1541-7786.MCR-13-0638"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/mcr.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2014\/02\/25\/1541-7786.MCR-13-0638.full.pdf","pmid":"24574518","pubdate":"2014-02-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"784","subjects":["molecularbiology","neoplasms","cellbiology"],"title":"DDB2 Suppresses Tumorigenicity by Limiting the Cancer Stem Cell Population in Ovarian Cancer","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ddb2-suppresses-tumorigenicity-limiting-cancer-stem-cell-population-ovarian-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4839903,"mean":5.7744062123599,"rank":4050405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4839903,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116149,"mean":8.6625975307368,"rank":95327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116149,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":524,"mean":2.9012466539197,"rank":437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":524,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":4.7805555555556,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
