In this study, we determined the complete mitogenome sequence of G. pachycheilus. Its complete mitochondrial genome is 16,675\u2009bp in size, and includes 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes and 1 control region, which has identical genomic organization and structure to other vertebrates, with the exception of 86\u2009bp non-coding region between tRNA(Thr) and tRNA(Pro). This new complete mitogenome could provide useful data for further studies on stock evaluation and conservation genetics of this species.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f610004220","authors":[" Chunna Chen","Chunna Chen","Chen C","Li H","Huang Y","Gong Q","Du J"],"doi":"10.3109\/19401736.2014.892084","first_seen_on":"2014-03-12T04:16:17+00:00","issns":["1940-1736","1940-1744"],"journal":"Mitochondrial DNA: The Journal of DNA Mapping, Sequencing & Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1394597751,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/19401736.2014.892084","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/19401736.2014.892084?ai=1p04&mi=3e34ke&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=MDN&","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/19401736.2014.892084"],"pmid":"24617490","pubdate":"2014-03-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"The complete mitochondrial genome of Gymnodiptychus pachycheilus (Teleostei, Cyprinidae, Schizothoracinae).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-mitochondrial-genome-igymnodiptychus-pachycheilusi-teleostei-cyprinidae-schizothoracinae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626596,"mean":4.9527436744422,"rank":2907422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":72945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626596,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93695,"mean":7.3768654556322,"rank":74444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93695,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":945,"mean":0.62207415254237,"rank":253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":945,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":0.57222222222222,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IHC_CellBiology\/status\/443601238152601600","license":"public","citation_ids":[2178228,2178228],"posted_on":"2014-03-12T04:15:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Cell Biology","url":"http:\/\/informahealthcare.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1253708030\/IHC-Twitter-profile-cell-biology2_normal.png","description":"Informa Healthcare's Cell Biology portfolio consists of 19 peer-reviewed journals designed to help you find the information you need for your research.","id_on_source":"IHC_CellBiology","tweeter_id":"140452905","geo":{"lt":"51.5072759","ln":"-0.1276597","country":"GB"},"followers":515},"tweet_id":"443601238152601600"}]}}
