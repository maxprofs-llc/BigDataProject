The approach allows for the implementation of novel functionalities in renewable and functional wood-based materials. The native wood structure is retained and used as a hierarchical multiscale framework for a modular two-step polymerization process. The versatility and potential of the approach is shown by a polymerization of either hydrophobic or hydrophilic and pH-responsive monomers in the wood structure. Characterization of the modified wood reveals the presence of polymer in the cell wall, and the new properties of these wood materials are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e64","authors":["Cabane, Etienne","Keplinger, Tobias","Merk, Vivian","Hass, Philipp","Burgert, Ingo"],"doi":"10.1002\/cssc.201301107","endpage":"1025","first_seen_on":"2014-03-11T07:27:46+00:00","issns":["1864-564X","1864-5631"],"issue":"4","journal":"ChemSusChem","last_mentioned_on":1394522859,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201301107\/abstract;jsessionid=39941725BC32F19C4C0CE2B823AEBCB6.f02t04?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+Saturday%2C+15+March+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+GMT+%2806%3A00-08%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201301107\/pdf","pmid":"24616291","pubdate":"2014-03-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Energy","Materials Science","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1020","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Renewable and Functional Wood Materials by Grafting Polymerization Within Cell Walls","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/renewable-functional-wood-materials-grafting-polymerization-within-cell-walls"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6302087,"mean":5.9763426049732,"rank":4656962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":941648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6302087,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138996,"mean":8.2779851217672,"rank":92846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":24802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138996,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":458,"mean":4.26504595186,"rank":228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":458,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.6910714285714,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Ph.
