While evidence indicates that exogenous attentional capture, a mechanism previously understood to be automatic, can be eliminated while concurrently performing a demanding task, we reframe this phenomenon within the theoretical framework of the \"attention set\" (Most et al., 2005). Consequently, the specific prediction that cuing effects should reappear when feature dimensions of the cue overlap with those in the attention set (i.e., elements of the demanding task) was empirically tested and confirmed using a dual-task paradigm involving both sustained attention and attentional capture, adapted from Santangelo et al. (2007). Participants were required to either detect a centrally presented target presented in a stream of distractors (the primary task), or respond to a spatially cued target (the secondary task). Importantly, the spatial cue could either share features with the target in the centrally presented primary task, or not share any features. Overall, the findings supported the attention set hypothesis showing that a spatial cuing effect was only observed when the peripheral cue shared a feature with objects that were already in the attention set (i.e., the primary task). However, this finding was accompanied by differential attentional orienting dependent on the different types of objects within the attention set, with feature-based orienting occurring for target-related objects, and additional spatial-based orienting for distractor-related objects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc0f","authors":["Lim, Ahnate","Sinnett, Scott"],"doi":"10.3389\/fnint.2014.00009","first_seen_on":"2014-03-11T10:14:15+00:00","issns":["1662-5145"],"journal":"Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1394532847,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fnint.2014.00009\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Article\/DownloadFile\/95758\/FLPDF\/fnint-08-00009.pdf\/6","pmid":"24523682","pubdate":"2014-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"title":"The interaction of feature and space based orienting within the attention set","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interaction-feature-space-based-orienting-within-attention-set"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4510149,"mean":5.2636614770391,"rank":3081131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":857508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4510149,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107334,"mean":8.3900028323071,"rank":71052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":20828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107334,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":345,"mean":5.8839069767442,"rank":272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":345,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":12.601384615385,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
