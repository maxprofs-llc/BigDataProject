NMDA produced an antagonist-reversible excitation of 46 nociceptive as well as nonnociceptive neurons. Microiontophoretic application of a preferential alpha2-adrenoceptor (alpha2AR) agonist, (2-[2, 6-dichloroaniline]-2-imidazoline) hydrochloride (clonidine), reduced the NMDA-evoked responses of 86% (6\/7) of nociceptive-specific (NS) neurons, 82% (9\/11) of wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons, and 67% (4\/6) of low-threshold (LT) neurons in the superficial dorsal horn. In the deeper dorsal horn, clonidine inhibited the NMDA-evoked responses of 94% (16\/17) of NS and WDR neurons and 60% (3\/5) of LT neurons. Clonidine facilitated the NMDA-evoked responses in 14% (1\/17) of NS, 9% (1\/11) of WDR, and 33% (2\/6) of LT neurons in the superficial dorsal horn. Idazoxan, an alpha2AR antagonist, reversed the inhibitory effect of clonidine in 90% (9\/10) of neurons, whereas prazosin, an alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist with affinity for alpha2BAR, and alpha2CAR, were ineffective. We suggest that activation of alpha2ARs produces a predominantly inhibitory modulation of the NMDA-evoked responses of nociceptive neurons in the medullary dorsal horn.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e78","first_seen_on":"2014-03-10T16:34:05+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Neurophysiology","last_mentioned_on":1394468760,"links":["http:\/\/jn.physiology.org\/content\/80\/4\/2210"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jn.physiology.org\/content\/80\/4\/2210.full.pdf","pmid":"9772273","pubdate":"1998-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Physiological Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"title":"\u03b12-Adrenoceptors Modulate NMDA-Evoked Responses of Neurons in Superficial and Deeper Dorsal Horn of the Medulla","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alpha2adrenoceptors-modulate-nmdaevoked-responses-neurons-superficial-deeper-dorsal-horn-medulla"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7977957,"mean":6.7344362661252,"rank":6903306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7977957,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174025,"mean":7.6725600376962,"rank":143011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174025,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3241,"mean":3.7493611111111,"rank":2882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3241,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.5910714285714,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/KapusteenEA\/status\/443060212459900928","license":"public","citation_ids":[2174058],"posted_on":"2014-03-10T16:26:00+00:00","author":{"name":"KapustinEA","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/GfPwPy3UtH","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/450301186717913089\/4kMvNGdy_normal.jpeg","description":"I simply love media, neoexistentialism & sift all dislike.\r\neugkapu@gmail.com\r\n WMZ: Z391854144823 | +37257484908","id_on_source":"KapusteenEA","tweeter_id":"106940524","followers":142},"tweet_id":"443060212459900928"}]}}
