The nanocomposite polymer was coated using a three-electrode electrochemical system and directly deposited on a Ni-Cr wire by applying a constant potential. The scanning electron microscopy images revealed that the new fiber exhibited a rather porous and homogenous surface. The thermal stability of the fabricated fiber was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis. The effects of different parameters influencing the extraction efficiency such as extraction temperature and time, salt addition, stirring rate, the amount of nanoclay, and desorption temperature were investigated and optimized. The method was exhaustively evaluated in terms of sensitivity, recovery, and reproducibility. The linearity ranges of 0.05-10 and 0.08-10 \u03bcg L(-1), and the detection limits of 0.020 and 0.035 \u03bcg L(-1) were obtained for diazinon and fenthion, respectively. The relative standard deviation values were calculated to be lower than 5% and 8% for intra-day and inter-day, respectively. Finally, the developed method was applied to determine the diazinon and fenthion (as model compounds) in cucumber, lettuce, apple, tap and river water samples. The satisfactory recoveries revealed the capability of the two-dimensional separation technique (retention time in GC and drift time in IMS) for the analysis of complex matrices extracted by SPME.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002249","doi":"10.1016\/j.aca.2014.01.037","first_seen_on":"2014-03-08T10:45:49+00:00","issns":["00032670"],"journal":"Analytica Chimica Acta","last_mentioned_on":1394276119,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0003267014001020"],"pmid":"24528846","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Polypyrrole\/montmorillonite nanocomposite as a new solid phase microextraction fiber combined with gas chromatography\u2013corona discharge ion mobility spectrometry for the simultaneous determination of diazinon and fenthion organophosphorus pesticides","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polypyrrolemontmorillonite-nanocomposite-new-solid-phase-microextraction-fiber-combined-gas-chromato"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2300125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1608293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107617,"mean":8.3467597197446,"rank":53350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":38514,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107617,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1063,"mean":1.4874011299435,"rank":311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1063,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.734375,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
