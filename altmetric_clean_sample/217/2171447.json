As would normally be anticipated for corrole complexes, the intensity of the Q(0,0) bands of 1 is greater than those of comparable phosphorus(V) tetraphenylporphyrins, but the \u03a6F values (0.25 for 1) are found to be comparable. A detailed analysis of the electronic structure of the complex was carried out by comparing electronic absorption and MCD spectral data to the results of TD-DFT calculations. The meso-aryl substituents, which enhance the lipophilicity of 1 and hence result in its localization in intracellular membranes during HeLa cell experiments, are predicted to result in a narrowing of the HOMO-LUMO gap and hence a red shift of the Q(0,0) bands toward the optical window in biological tissues.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Xu Liang","John Mack","Li-Min Zheng","Zhen Shen","Nagao Kobayashi"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic402347w","first_seen_on":"2014-03-08T20:33:07+00:00","issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1396262981,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic402347w"],"pmid":"24597460","pubdate":"2014-03-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"140305124501009","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"\n              Phosphorus(V)-Corrole: Synthesis, Spectroscopic Properties, Theoretical Calculations, and Potential Utility for\n              \n              Applications in Living Cells\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phosphorusvcorrole-synthesis-spectroscopic-properties-theoretical-calculations-potential-utility-viv-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3059007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107617,"mean":8.370576029587,"rank":71828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":22095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107617,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5999,"mean":1.2444788262754,"rank":2578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5999,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":309,"mean":1.3409675324675,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":309,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
