CB transplantation is limited by low cell doses and delays in neutrophil and platelet engraftment. CB progenitors expanded ex vivo before transplantation provide more rapid hematopoietic and immune reconstitution as well as less engraftment failure compared with unmanipulated CB. However, the safety of infusing double and ex vivo-expanded CB has not been systematically examined.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5233cf058f610003b55","authors":["Bear, Adham S.","Hanley, Patrick J.","Bosque, Doyle M.","Cruz, Conrad R.","Kaur, Indresh","Liu, Hao","Kebriaei, Partow","Hosing, Chitra","Rezvani, Katayoun","Oran, Betul","De Lima, Marcos J.","Bollard, Catherine M.","Shpall, Elizabeth J.","Bear AS","Hanley PJ","Bosque DM","Cruz CR","Kaur I","Liu H","Kebriaei P","Hosing C","Rezvani K","Oran B","De Lima MJ","Bollard CM","Shpall EJ","Adham S.
