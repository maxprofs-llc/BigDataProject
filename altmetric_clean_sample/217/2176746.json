A system is composed of one or more information systems, their stakeholders, and the environment. These systems offer health services to individuals and thus implement ubiquitous computing. Privacy is the key challenge for ubiquitous health because of autonomous processing, rich contextual metadata, lack of predefined trust among participants, and the business objectives. Additionally, regulations and policies of stakeholders may be unknown to the individual. Context-sensitive privacy policies are needed to regulate information processing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Antto Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4"],"doi":"10.2196\/mhealth.3123","first_seen_on":"2014-03-11T14:59:52+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"1","journal":"JMIR mhealth and uhealth","last_mentioned_on":1394550578,"links":["http:\/\/mhealth.jmir.org\/2014\/1\/e12\/"],"pmid":"25100084","pubdate":"2016-02-13T20:14:00+00:00","publisher":"JMIR Publications Inc., Toronto, Canada","title":"Privacy-Related Context Information for Ubiquitous Health","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/privacyrelated-context-information-ubiquitous-health"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4759395,"mean":5.7098541322724,"rank":2504763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":2232584,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4759395,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113640,"mean":8.5422585380021,"rank":56284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":56748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113640,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.25,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":5573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":653,"mean":3.5679447852761,"rank":288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":653,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
