The assembled nanostructure is confirmed by FESEM and optical microscopy. The assembly is not hindered when a protein (insulin) is incorporated within the nanoparticles as an active ingredient. MTS cytotoxicity tests on SW-620 cell lines show that the peptides, copolymers, and peptide-copolymer conjugates are biocompatible. The methodology of self-assembled nanoparticle fibers and 3D scaffolds is intended to combine the advantages of a flexible hydrogel scaffold with the versatility of controlled release nanoparticles to offer unprecedented ability to incorporate desired drug(s) within a self-assembled scaffold system with individual control over the release of each drug.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008093","authors":["Ding, Xiaochu","Janjanam, Jagadeesh","Tiwari, Ashutosh","Thompson, Martin","Heiden, Patricia A."],"doi":"10.1002\/mabi.201300569","endpage":"871","first_seen_on":"2014-03-10T15:04:45+00:00","issns":["1616-5195","1616-5187"],"issue":"6","journal":"Macromolecular Bioscience","last_mentioned_on":1423825925,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mabi.201300569\/abstract;jsessionid=1E422CBF5868EB8F1E06A7167FBC42CD.f03t02?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+Saturday%2C+15+March+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+GMT+%2806%3A00-08%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24610743?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mabi.201300569\/pdf","pmid":"24610743","pubdate":"2014-03-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"853","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Peptide-Directed Self-Assembly of Functionalized Polymeric Nanoparticles Part I: Design and Self-Assembly of Peptide-Copolymer Conjugates into Nanoparticle Fibers and 3D Scaffolds<sup>a.<\/sup>","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/peptidedirected-selfassembly-functionalized-polymeric-nanoparticles-part-i-design-selfassembly-pepti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6302087,"mean":5.9763426049732,"rank":4429117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1645723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6302087,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138842,"mean":8.3317419638293,"rank":87636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":45976,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138842,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":576,"mean":1.8734017391304,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":576,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.185,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
