Global gene expression profiling studies have demonstrated that BC comprises distinct molecular classes with clinical relevance. In this study, we hypothesised that molecular features of BC are a key driver of tumour behaviour and when coupled with a novel and bespoke application of established clinicopathologic prognostic variables can predict both clinical outcome and relevant therapeutic options more accurately than existing methods.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000243d","authors":["E A Rakha","D Soria","A R Green","C Lemetre","D G Powe","C C Nolan","J M Garibaldi","G Ball","I O Ellis"],"doi":"10.1038\/bjc.2014.120","first_seen_on":"2014-03-12T11:21:01+00:00","funders":["mrc"],"issns":["0007-0920","1532-1827"],"journal":"British Journal of Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1396451048,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/bjc\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/bjc2014120a.html?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatRevClinOncol","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/bjc\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/bjc2014120a.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24619074","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/bjc\/journal\/v110\/n7\/full\/bjc2014120a.html?WT.ec_id=BJC-201404","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/bjc.2014.120"],"pmid":"24619074","pubdate":"2014-03-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Nottingham Prognostic Index Plus (NPI+): a modern clinical decision making tool in breast cancer.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nottingham-prognostic-index-plus-npi-modern-clinical-decision-making-tool-breast-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":69.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":69.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230013,"mean":5.9668566214658,"rank":81430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":6148588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230013,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131900,"mean":8.5149221298116,"rank":2994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":128903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131900,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3024,"mean":8.7588223618922,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":2978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3024,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":10.772483516484,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
