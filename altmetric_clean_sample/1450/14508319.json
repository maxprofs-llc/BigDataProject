The zygospores germinate to form a linear four-celled conidiophore, each cell producing a spherical conidium ejected as in Conidiobolus, thus confirming that the organism belongs in the Entomophthorales. The resemblance between the conidiophore of Tabanomyces milkoi and the basidium of the rusts supports the old concept that the rust fungi may be related to the Entomophthorales.","ads_id":"1979PNAS...76.2299C","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["J.
