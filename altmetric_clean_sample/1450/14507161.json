The parent promonocyte cell line U937 was chronically infected with HIV-1 and from this line a clone, U1, was derived. U1 showed minimal constitutive expression of HIV-1, but virus expression was markedly up-regulated by a phytohemagglutinin-induced supernatant containing multiple cytokines and by recombinant granulocyte\/macrophage colony-stimulating factor alone. Recombinant interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha did not up-regulate virus expression. Concomitant with the cytokine-induced up-regulation of HIV-1, expression of membrane-bound IL-1 beta was selectively induced in U1 in the absence of induction of other surface membrane proteins. This cytokine up-regulation of IL-1 beta was not seen in the uninfected parent U937 cell line. These studies have implications for the understanding of the mechanism of progression from a latent or low-level HIV-1 infection to a productive infection with resulting immunosuppression. In addition, this model can be used to delineate the potential mechanisms whereby HIV-1 infection regulates cellular gene expression.","ads_id":"1987Sci...238..800F","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["TM Folks","J Justement","A Kinter","CA Dinarello","AS Fauci"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.3313729","endpage":"802","first_seen_on":"2016-12-06T13:20:42+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0036-8075","1095-9203"],"issue":"4828","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":909705600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.3313729"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/sci\/238\/4828\/800.full.pdf","pmid":"3313729","pubdate":"1987-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"800","subjects":["science"],"title":"Cytokine-induced expression of HIV-1 in a chronically infected promonocyte cell line","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1126\/science.3313729","volume":"238","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cytokineinduced-expression-hiv1-chronically-infected-promonocyte-cell-line"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8084529,"mean":6.8647357337294,"rank":1312417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6698537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8084529,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262503,"mean":12.255231342999,"rank":62415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":199801,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262503,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40950,"mean":32.820812034482,"rank":18472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":21710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40950,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":921,"mean":79.289869565218,"rank":477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":921,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
