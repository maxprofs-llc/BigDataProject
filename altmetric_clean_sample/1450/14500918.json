The western zone emerged at the continental margin, but the eastern zone was entirely beneath the continental plate. Mesozoic subduction apparently occurred along a single steeper zone.","ads_id":"1971Sci...174..821L","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Peter W. Lipman","Harold J.
