Together with transkingdom interactions, it can interplay with genetic variation in the host to establish specific phenotypes. These interactions can lead to phenotypes not observed with either the virus or the host variation alone. Unfavorable alteration of gut virome composition has been implicated in chronic, and perhaps also systemic, immune disorders, such as in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. This review focuses on what is currently known regarding the role of commensal gut virome in chronic gut inflammation, and speculate on the important translational implications in regard to gut virome modulation in inflammatory bowel disease with the end goal of promoting gut health.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007774","authors":["Lopetuso, Loris R.","Ianiro, Gianluca","Scaldaferri, Franco","Cammarota, Giovanni","Gasbarrini, Antonio","Lopetuso, Loris R"],"doi":"10.1097\/mib.0000000000000807","endpage":"1712","first_seen_on":"2016-05-24T15:37:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-4844","1078-0998"],"issue":"7","journal":"Inflammatory Bowel Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1474817267,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ibdjournal\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Gut_Virome_and_Inflammatory_Bowel_Disease_.98805.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27206017"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ibdjournal\/9000\/00000\/Gut_Virome_and_Inflammatory_Bowel_Disease_.98805.pdf","pmid":"27206017","pubdate":"2016-05-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Gut Virome and Inflammatory Bowel Disease","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ibdjournal\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Gut_Virome_and_Inflammatory_Bowel_Disease_.98805.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gut-virome-inflammatory-bowel-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":3791073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4546007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273954,"mean":11.648865893054,"rank":114276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":155855,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273954,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1683,"mean":3.7499346016647,"rank":715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":938,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1683,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":7.4896666666667,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
