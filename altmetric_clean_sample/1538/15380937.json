Moreover, alteration of glycogen metabolism in the brain contributes to neurodegenerative processes. In the brain, both muscle and brain glycogen phosphorylase isozymes regulate glycogen mobilization. However, given their distinct regulatory features, these two isozymes could confer distinct metabolic functions of glycogen in brain. Interestingly, recent proteomics studies have identified isozyme-specific reactive cysteine residues in brain glycogen phosphorylase (bGP). In this manuscript, we show that the activity of human bGP is redox-regulated through the formation of a disulphide bond involving a highly reactive cysteine unique to the bGP isozyme. We found that this disulphide bond acts as a redox switch that precludes the allosteric activation of the enzyme by AMP without affecting its activation by phosphorylation. This unique regulatory feature of bGP sheds new light on the isoform-specific regulation of glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen metabolism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Mathieu, Cecile","Duval, Romain","Cocaign, Angelique","Petit, Emile","Bui, Linh-Chi","Haddad, Iman","Vinh, Joelle","Etchebest, Catherine","Dupret, Jean-Marie","Rodrigues Lima, Fernando"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m116.757062","endpage":"23853","first_seen_on":"2017-01-11T08:43:32+00:00","issns":["1083-351X","0021-9258"],"issue":"46","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1484125072,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27660393"],"pmid":"27660393","pubdate":"2016-11-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"23842","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"An Isozyme-specific Redox Switch in Human Brain Glycogen Phosphorylase Modulates Its Allosteric Activation by AMP","type":"article","volume":"291","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isozymespecific-redox-switch-human-brain-glycogen-phosphorylase-modulates-allosteric-activation-amp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8058252,"mean":6.8390091159945,"rank":3787853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4091593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8058252,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254654,"mean":12.790358307186,"rank":122906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":124850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254654,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30829,"mean":3.2524080705852,"rank":20670,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":9621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30829,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":335,"mean":6.6290718562874,"rank":171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":335,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DSIMB_Lab\/statuses\/819102378263724033","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15380937],"posted_on":"2017-01-11T08:43:19+00:00","author":{"name":"DSIMB Lab","url":"http:\/\/www.dsimb.inserm.fr\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/818735585460359168\/NljZCtZd_normal.jpg","description":"DSIMB team is the bioinformatics team of INSERM UMR_S 1134 unit (Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Cit\u00e9)  located at INTS, Paris.","id_on_source":"DSIMB_Lab","tweeter_id":"816329808544169984","geo":{"lt":48.85341,"ln":2.3488,"country":"FR"},"followers":45},"tweet_id":"819102378263724033"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AlexTwentySeve\/statuses\/819106039719149568","license":"gnip","rt":["DSIMB_Lab"],"citation_ids":[15380937],"posted_on":"2017-01-11T08:57:52+00:00","author":{"name":"Alex TwentySeven","url":"http:\/\/www.dsimb.inserm.fr\/~debrevern\/index.php","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2223116728\/385837_323556524340474_205344452828349_1221955_1396524456_n_normal.jpg","description":"only 160 char to describe ... naaaa too short ...","id_on_source":"AlexTwentySeve","tweeter_id":"229110162","geo":{"lt":48.85341,"ln":2.3488,"country":"FR"},"followers":122},"tweet_id":"819106039719149568"}]}}
