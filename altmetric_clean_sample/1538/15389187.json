The analysis included 308 patients with CML in the chronic phase who were extracted from the CML Cooperative Study Group database. Of these patients, 11 (3.6%) were identified as having TR-CML. No differences in age, sex, white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, platelet count, or European Treatment and Outcome Study risk were observed between patients with TR-CML vs. de novo CML. However, the responses of TR-CML patients to TKIs (6, 3, and 2 received imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, respectively) were excellent; all achieved major or deep molecular response. Furthermore, the outcomes of TR-CML patients were relatively favorable; the 3-year event-free survival rates in the TR-CML and de novo CML patients were 100% and 94%, respectively; the difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, our study showed that TR-CML patients could achieve a good clinical course with TKI therapy. Detailed investigations of TR-CML may provide new insights into CML biology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fa3cf058f610003009","authors":["Noriyoshi Iriyama","Michihide Tokuhira","Tomoiku Takaku","Eriko Sato","Maho Ishikawa","Tomonori Nakazato","Kei-Ji Sugimoto","Hiroyuki Fujita","Isao Fujioka","Yoshihiro Hatta","Masahiro Kizaki","Norio Komatsu","Norio Asou","Tatsuya Kawaguchi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.leukres.2017.01.003","first_seen_on":"2017-01-11T14:56:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-5835"],"journal":"Leukemia Research","last_mentioned_on":1484146560,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=3&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lrjournal.com%2Farticle%2FS0145-2126%252817%252930003-6%2Ffulltext%3Frss%3Dyes&code=lr-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.lrjournal.com\/article\/S0145212617300036\/pdf","pmid":"28109974","pubdate":"2017-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Incidences and outcomes of therapy-related chronic myeloid leukemia in the era of tyrosine kinase inhibitors: surveillance of the CML Cooperative Study Group","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/incidences-outcomes-therapyrelated-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-era-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors-surveilla"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8058252,"mean":6.8390091159945,"rank":6977675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8058252,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254653,"mean":12.790412068234,"rank":210171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254653,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":657,"mean":2.0060884146341,"rank":527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":657,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.015,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
