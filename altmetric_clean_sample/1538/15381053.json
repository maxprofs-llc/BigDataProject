Although there is growing interest in the management of the physical capability of patients with bone metastasis, the mechanism underlying the impairment of bone mechanical function remains unclear. The alignment of both collagen fibrils and biological apatite (BAp) c-axis, together with bone mineral density, is one of the strongest contributors to bone mechanical function. In this study, we qualitatively and quantitatively assessed the bone microstructure of the mouse femurs with and without PCa cell inoculation. Histological assessment revealed that the bone-forming pattern in the PCa-bearing bone was non-directional, resulting in a spongious structure, whereas that in the control bone was unidirectional and layer-by-layer, resulting in a compact lamellar structure. The degree of preferential alignment of collagen fibrils and BAp, which was evaluated by quantitative polarized microscopy and microbeam X-ray diffraction, respectively, were significantly lower in the PCa-bearing bone than in the control bone. Material parameters including Young's modulus and toughness, measured by the three-point bending test, were simultaneously decreased in the PCa-bearing bone. Specifically, there was a significant positive correlation between the BAp c-axis orientation and Young's modulus. In conclusion, the impairment of mechanical function in the PCa-bearing bone is attributable to disruption of the anisotropic microstructure of bone in multiple phases. This is the first report demonstrating that cancer bone metastasis induces disruption of the collagen\/BAp alignment in long bones, thereby impairing their mechanical function.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002413","authors":["Aiko Sekita","Aira Matsugaki","Takayoshi Nakano"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bone.2017.01.004","first_seen_on":"2017-01-11T08:50:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["87563282","1873-2763"],"journal":"BONE","last_mentioned_on":1484124562,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S8756328217300042","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bone.2017.01.004"],"pmid":"28069516","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","orthopedics"],"title":"Disruption of collagen\/apatite alignment impairs bone mechanical function in osteoblastic metastasis induced by prostate cancer","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S8756328217300042","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/disruption-collagenapatite-alignment-impairs-bone-mechanical-function-osteoblastic-metastasis-induce"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8058252,"mean":6.8390091159945,"rank":6977673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8058252,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254653,"mean":12.790411871888,"rank":210168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254653,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1752,"mean":3.0612826956025,"rank":1296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1752,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":2.5878260869565,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
