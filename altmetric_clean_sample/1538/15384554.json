Through flash vacuum pyrolysis of CF3 S(O)NCO at ca. 1200\u2005K, sulfinyl isocyanate, bearing resonance structures of O=C-N=S=O and O=C=N-S=O, has been generated in the gas phase and subsequently characterized in cryogenic matrices (Ar and N2 ). Its reversible conformational (syn and anti) interconversion and photodecomposition were observed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Wu, Zhuang","Liu, Qifan","Xu, Jian","Sun, Hailong","Li, Dingqing","Song, Chao","Andrada, Diego M.","Frenking, Gernot","Trabelsi, Tarek","Francisco, Joseph S.","Zeng, Xiaoqing"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201611576","first_seen_on":"2017-01-11T10:48:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-3773"],"journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
