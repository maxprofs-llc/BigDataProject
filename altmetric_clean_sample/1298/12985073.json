In this context, computational tools capable of accurately predicting effector proteins of the various types of bacterial secretion systems are highly desirable. Existing computational approaches use different machine learning (ML) techniques and heterogeneous features derived from protein sequences and\/or structural information. These predictors differ not only in terms of the used ML methods but also with respect to the used curated data sets, the features selection and their prediction performance. Here, we provide a comprehensive survey and benchmarking of currently available tools for the prediction of effector proteins of bacterial types III, IV and VI secretion systems (T3SS, T4SS and T6SS, respectively). We review core algorithms, feature selection techniques, tool availability and applicability and evaluate the prediction performance based on carefully curated independent test data sets. In an effort to improve predictive performance, we constructed three ensemble models based on ML algorithms by integrating the output of all individual predictors reviewed. Our benchmarks demonstrate that these ensemble models outperform all the reviewed tools for the prediction of effector proteins of T3SS and T4SS. The webserver of the proposed ensemble methods for T3SS and T4SS effector protein prediction is freely available at http:\/\/tbooster.erc.monash.edu\/index.jsp We anticipate that this survey will serve as a useful guide for interested users and that the new ensemble predictors will stimulate research into host-pathogen relationships and inspiration for the development of new bioinformatics tools for predicting effector proteins of T3SS, T4SS and T6SS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002432","authors":["Yi An","Jiawei Wang","Chen Li","Andr\u00e9 Leier","Tatiana Marquez-Lago","Jonathan Wilksch","Yang Zhang","Geoffrey I.
