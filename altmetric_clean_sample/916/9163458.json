Practices regarding patient\/family education in Children's Oncology Group (COG) treatment centers have not been well described. We used an Internet-based survey to determine current patient\/family educational practices at COG institutions; participation rate was 90.5% (201\/222). Patient\/family education was delivered primarily by an individual (rather than a team) at 43% of institutions. Advanced practice nurses had primary responsibility for providing education at 32% of institutions. \"Fever\" was the most frequently reported topic considered mandatory for inclusion in education for newly diagnosed patients. More than half of institutions reported using checklists and\/or end-of-shift reports to facilitate health care team communication regarding patient\/family education, and 77% reported using the \"teach-back\" method of assessing readiness for discharge. Thirty-seven percent of institutions reported delays in hospital discharge secondary to the need for additional teaching. An understanding of current practices related to patient\/family education is the first step in establishing effective interventions to improve and standardize educational practices in pediatric oncology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a87","authors":["Withycombe, Janice S","Andam-Mejia, Rachel","Dwyer, Annie","Slaven, Abigail","Windt, Katherine","Landier, Wendy"],"doi":"10.1177\/1043454216652857","first_seen_on":"2016-07-01T20:31:49+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1532-8457","1043-4542"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatric Oncology Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1468592232,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27283721?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27283721"],"pmid":"27283721","pubdate":"2016-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","neoplasms","pediatrics"],"title":"A Comprehensive Survey of Institutional Patient\/Family Educational Practices for Newly Diagnosed Pediatric Oncology Patients: A Report From the Childrens Oncology Group","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comprehensive-survey-institutional-patientfamily-educational-practices-newly-diagnosed-pediatric-onc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8076187,"mean":6.8570931149856,"rank":779623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7294341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8076187,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261349,"mean":11.628541416042,"rank":36677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":224560,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261349,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199,"mean":5.8380808080808,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.83333333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Linguistics":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Kathyanderson6\/statuses\/748914997196042241","license":"gnip","rt":["notimetoteach"],"citation_ids":[9163458],"posted_on":"2016-07-01T16:23:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Kathy Anderson","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2374501288\/image_normal.jpg","description":"Co Founder@emilycenter Southwest Kids Cancer Foundation Board Member Co Founder Gold Ribbon Champions","id_on_source":"Kathyanderson6","tweeter_id":"111375099","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":45},"tweet_id":"748914997196042241"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/notimetoteach\/statuses\/748904118375317504","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9163458],"posted_on":"2016-07-01T15:40:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Fran London","url":"http:\/\/www.notimetoteach.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/728973617132765184\/tnVXwHdc_normal.jpg","description":"After saving lives, the most important service of health care providers is patient and family education. 2010 AJN Book of the Year. 2016 edition now available.","id_on_source":"notimetoteach","tweeter_id":"68849705","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":760},"tweet_id":"748904118375317504"}],"news":[{"title":"Winship authored publications for June 2016","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=27272597826&p=1pl&v=1&x=nPXUVwrS7we--EYg6ruRGw","license":"public","citation_ids":[8684359,7361119,6259970,9728831,7085276,7823841,5032616,9728834,8528148,9163458,8757926,8757777,8832722,9075502,9016925,9219099,8437653,9728835,5030090,6038889,7380860,5531768,9728836,9728837,5077012,6879761,5024733,9728838,9728839,7537046,4783809,8667960,8447950,8522099,9728842,8134572,8460405,8591369,8525599,8622824,8615900,9728843,6628111,8283548,8835466,8881353,5075651,8927883,8968080,9728847,9728849,9728850,9728851,9053815,9624428,9279616,9728852],"posted_on":"2016-07-15T14:17:12+00:00","summary":"(via noodls) \/ Various first authors and senior authors from Winship Cancer Institute have published 64 studies in major medical and scientific journals in the past month.","author":{"name":"Noodls","url":"http:\/\/www.noodls.com\/index.asp","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/955\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2016-02-11_at_11.48.48.png?1455191394"}}]}}
