SGT-53 is a liposomal nanocomplex designed for systemic, tumor-targeting delivery of the wt p53 gene. In this nanodelivery system, an anti-transferrin receptor single-chain antibody fragment serves as the targeting moiety. In an initial Phase I trial in patients with advanced solid tumors, SGT-53 demonstrated tumor-specific targeting, was shown to be well tolerated, and was associated with an anti-tumor effect in several patients. Pre-clinical studies by us have also demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity to the combination of SGT-53 and docetaxel. Thus, this dose-escalation trial was undertaken to assess the combination of SGT-53 and docetaxel for safety and potential efficacy in 14 advanced cancer patients. Results reveal that the combination of SGT-53 (maximum dose, 3.6 mg DNA\/infusion) and docetaxel (75 mg\/m2\/infusion) was well tolerated. Moreover, clinical activity involving twelve evaluable patients was observed. Three of these patients achieved RECIST-verified partial responses with tumor reductions of -47%, -51% and -79%. Two others had stable disease with significant shrinkage (-25%, and -16%). These results support Phase II testing of SGT-53 in combination with docetaxel.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000311d","authors":["Pirollo, Kathleen F","Nemunaitis, John","Leung, Po Ki","Nunan, Robert","Adams, Jana","Chang, Esther H"],"doi":"10.1038\/mt.2016.135","first_seen_on":"2016-07-01T17:37:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1525-0024","1525-0016"],"journal":"Molecular Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1467566279,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27357628?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27357628","pubdate":"2016-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Safety and Efficacy in Advanced Solid Tumors of Docetaxel in Combination with a Targeted Nanocomplex Carrying the p53 Gene: A Phase Ib Study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-efficacy-advanced-solid-tumors-targeted-nanocomplex-carrying-p53-gene-used-combination-doceta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7981790,"mean":6.7349664530035,"rank":3348983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4619608,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7981790,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260799,"mean":11.53682298944,"rank":101294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":158939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260799,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1240,"mean":10.161247780468,"rank":703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1240,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":26.4039,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
