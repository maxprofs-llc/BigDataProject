Epidemiological studies have shown that female gender is a favorable prognostic factor, which may be explained by estrogens. Here we show that when grafting human DLBCL cells to immunocompromised mice, tumor growth in males is faster. When treating mice grafted with either germinal center or activated B-cell like DLBCL cells with the selective estrogen receptor \u03b2 (ER\u03b2) agonist diarylpropionitrile, tumor growth was significantly inhibited. Furthermore, nuclear ER\u03b21 expression analysis in primary DLBCL's by immunohistochemistry revealed expression in 89% of the cases. Nuclear ER\u03b21 expression was in a univariate and multivariate analysis, an independent prognostic factor for adverse progression-free survival in Rituximab-chemotherapy treated DLBCL (p\u2009=\u20090.02 and p\u2009=\u20090.04, respectively). These results suggest that estrogen signaling through ER\u03b21 is an interesting future therapeutic target for treatment of DLBCL, and that ER\u03b21 expression can be used as a prognostic marker.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004181","authors":["Hasni, Muhammad Sharif","Berglund, Mattias","Yakimchuk, Konstantin","Guan, Jiyu","Linderoth, Johan","Amini, Rose Marie","Enblad, Gunilla","Okret, Sam"],"doi":"10.1080\/10428194.2016.1193853","endpage":"10","first_seen_on":"2016-07-01T16:50:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1029-2403","1042-8194"],"journal":"Leukemia & Lymphoma","last_mentioned_on":1467372634,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27357538?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=immunegc_papers"],"pmid":"27357538","pubdate":"2016-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1","subjects":["neoplasms","hematology"],"title":"Estrogen receptor \u03b21 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma growth and as a prognostic biomarker","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/estrogen-receptor-beta1-diffuse-large-bcell-lymphoma-growth-prognostic-biomarker"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7974292,"mean":6.7330879653071,"rank":6900439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7974292,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260731,"mean":11.540025697081,"rank":218860,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260731,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1208,"mean":2.1419204639602,"rank":1016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1208,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.48625,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ImmuneGC_Papers\/statuses\/748841218935627776","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9160176],"posted_on":"2016-07-01T11:30:34+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmuneGCPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/686613538853396480\/Q7XNQGGq_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot #GC papers #PubMed | \u22652016 | #GerminalCenters are formed during #immunity for #evolution of #antibodies & #Bcell memory | Curated @mmw_lmw","id_on_source":"ImmuneGC_Papers","tweeter_id":"4734596798","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":19},"tweet_id":"748841218935627776"}]}}
