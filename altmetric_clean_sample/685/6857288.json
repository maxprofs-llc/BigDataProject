To clarify the gene regulation systems activated in response to photooxidative stress, we isolated 76 high light and heat shock stress-inducible genes, including heat shock transcription factor (Hsf) A2 from Arabidopsis. Unlike yeast or animals, more than 20 genes encoding putative Hsfs are present in the genomes of higher plants, and they are categorized into three classes based on their structural characterization. However, the multiplicity of Hsfs in plants remains unknown. Furthermore, the individual functions of Hsfs are also largely unknown because of their genetic redundancy. Recently, the developments of T-DNA insertion knockout mutant lines and chimeric repressor gene-silencing technology have provided effective tools for exploring the individual functions of Hsfs. This review describes the current knowledge on the individual functions and activation mechanisms of Hsfs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c94","authors":["Yabuta, Yukinori"],"doi":"10.1080\/09168451.2016.1176515","endpage":"10","first_seen_on":"2016-04-21T13:02:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1347-6947","0916-8451"],"journal":"Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1461250029,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27095030?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27095030","pubdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"\n              Functions of heat shock transcription factors involved in response to photooxidative stresses in\n              Arabidopsis\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/functions-heat-shock-transcription-factors-involved-response-photooxidative-stresses-arabidopsis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7584550,"mean":6.538792679956,"rank":5739679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1017552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7584550,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267005,"mean":11.297981842968,"rank":186921,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43089,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267005,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":978,"mean":3.1217256908905,"rank":647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":978,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":2.3546875,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
