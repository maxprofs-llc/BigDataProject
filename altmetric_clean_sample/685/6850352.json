The aim of this study was the investigation of the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and methylprednisolone (MET) in the modulation of liver warm ischemia during hepatic resection.\nForty-eight patients were enrolled in a pilot double-blind, randomized clinical trial. The patients received either NAC, MET, or placebo. The primary endpoint was the reduction in postoperative alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin. The secondary endpoint was the difference in morbidity and mortality.\nAll the 48 patients had liver resection with no mortality. Morbidity was observed in 8 (16\u00a0%) patients equally distributed among the groups. There was a significant favorable recovery of liver function tests in patients treated with NAC or MET compared with the placebo when the Pringle maneuver exceeded 70\u00a0min.\nThe administration of NAC or MET prior to the Pringle maneuver during hepatic resection is associated with lower postoperative aberration in liver function tests compared with placebo when the Pringle maneuver exceeded 70\u00a0min. Larger studies are required to validate our findings and to investigate the specific role of NAC and MET in liver surgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003741","authors":["Donadon, Matteo","Molinari, Andrea Forastieri","Corazzi, Francesco","Rocchi, Laura","Zito, Paola","Cimino, Matteo","Costa, Guido","Raimondi, Ferdinando","Torzilli, Guido"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00268-016-3506-1","first_seen_on":"2016-04-21T10:20:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-2323","0364-2313"],"journal":"World Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1461237861,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27094558?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27094558","pubdate":"2016-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Abdominal Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiac Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"General Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Thoracic Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Vascular Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Pharmacological Modulation of Ischemic-Reperfusion Injury during Pringle Maneuver in Hepatic Surgery.
