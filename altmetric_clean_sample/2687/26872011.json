MicroRNA plays pivotal roles in cellular and developmental processes by regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Increasing evidence suggests the involvement of microRNAs in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including MS. We have already found that the expression of a specific miRNA, hsa-mir-26a-5p (miR-26a), changed during INF-\u03b2 treatment in responder Relapsing-Remitting MS patients. Functional annotations of mir-26a targets revealed that a number of genes were implicated in Glutamate Receptor Signaling pathway, which is notoriously altered in neurodegenerative diseases as MS. In this study, the different potential targets were subjected to a validation test based on luciferase reporter constructs transfected in an oligodendroglial cell line. In this functional screening, miR-26a was able to interact with SLC1A1 3' UTR suppressing the reporter activity. Transfection of a miR-26a mimic was then shown to decrease the endogenous SLC1A1 mRNA. Afterward, we have evaluated in blood platelets from interferon-\u03b2 treated Multiple Sclerosis patients the expression of miR-26a and SLC1A1, finding not only their converse expression, but also a responsiveness to interferon-\u03b2 therapy. Overall, these data suggest that mir-26a and SLC1A1 may play a role in the MS pathogenesis, and may be potential targets for the development of new biomarkers and\/or therapeutic tools.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002393","authors":["Potenza Nicoletta","Mosca Nicola","Mondola Paolo","Damiano Simona","Russo Aniello","Bruna De Felice"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbadis.2017.09.024","first_seen_on":"2017-10-01T10:27:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["09254439","0006-3002"],"journal":"BBA - Molecular Basis of Disease","last_mentioned_on":1506878704,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28962897?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28962897","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Human miR-26a-5p regulates the glutamate transporter SLC1A1 (EAAT3) expression.
