Nevertheless, several aspects of the correlation between the aggregation process and the onset and development of the pathology remain largely elusive. In this context, biophysical and biochemical studies in test tubes have proven extremely powerful in providing quantitative information about the structure and the reactivity of amyloids at the molecular level. In this review we use selected recent examples to illustrate the importance of such biophysical research to complement phenomenological studies based on cellular and molecular biology, and we discuss the implications for pharmaceutical applications associated with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders in both academic and industrial contexts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032da","authors":["Paolo Arosio"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11095-017-2266-4","first_seen_on":"2017-10-01T10:18:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0724-8741","1573-904X"],"journal":"Pharmaceutical Research","last_mentioned_on":1506853094,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28963701?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+PubmedNeurobrain+%28Pubmed%3A+Neurobrain%29"],"pmid":"28963701","pubdate":"2017-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Law","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacy","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Biophysical Aspects of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease: Implications for Pharmaceutical Sciences","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0.25,"6d":0.25,"5d":0.25,"4d":0.25,"3d":0.25,"2d":0.25,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462593,"mean":7.1086032149407,"rank":7311978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462593,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107236,"mean":11.238127327832,"rank":86938,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107236,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":768,"mean":3.2767640156454,"rank":605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":768,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.9,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/i_zekel\/statuses\/914434271196086273","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26871636],"posted_on":"2017-10-01T10:18:14+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroBrain","url":"https:\/\/4good.org\/zekel-healthcare-foundation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/541547903777382401\/YH9jDIiN_normal.jpeg","description":"Healthcare IT Health services research as the multidisciplinary field of scientific investigation.","id_on_source":"i_zekel","tweeter_id":"2383620488","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":715},"tweet_id":"914434271196086273"}]}}
