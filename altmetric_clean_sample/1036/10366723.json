Aristolochic acid is an important biomarker component present in the Aristolochiaceae family. The isolation method involved simple solvent extraction, precipitation and further purification, using recrystallization. The structure of the compound was confirmed using infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. A specific and rapid high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) method was developed for analysis of aristolochic acid. The method involved separation on the silica gel 60 F254 plates using the single solvent system of n-hexane: chloroform: methanol. The method showed good linear relationship in the range 0.4-2.0\u00a0\u03bcg\/spot with r(2)\u00a0=\u00a00.998. The limit of detection and limit of quantification were 62.841\u00a0ng\/spot and 209.47\u00a0ng\/spot, respectively. The proposed validated HPTLC method was found to be an easy to use, accurate and convenient method that could be successfully used for standardization and quality assessment of herbal material as well as formulations containing different species of the Aristolochiaceae family.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fe5","authors":["Poonam Agrawal","Kirti Laddha"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jfda.2016.06.006","first_seen_on":"2016-08-10T05:29:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["10219498","1021-9498"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Food & Drug Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1495001257,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1021949816300874","http:\/\/www.jfda-online.com\/article\/S1021-9498(16)30087-4\/fulltext"],"pmid":"28911686","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Development of validated high-performance thin layer chromatography for quantification of aristolochic acid in different species of the Aristolochiaceae family","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-validated-highperformance-thin-layer-chromatography-quantification-aristolochic-acid-dif"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":6241300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1106246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257494,"mean":11.995340952958,"rank":182734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":40209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257494,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":2.4515362318841,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":3.5966666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
