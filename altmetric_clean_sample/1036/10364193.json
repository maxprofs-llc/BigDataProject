'Atena Polka' was found to reduce total PCDD\/PCDF concentration by 37\u00a0% in soil amended with sludge and 32\u00a0% in soil treated with sediment from an urban reservoir. The TEQ reduction was almost twofold greater: 68\u00a0% in soil amended with sludge and 52\u00a0% with urban sediment. Addition of sludge increased root growth inhibition of L. sativum, S. alba and S. saccharatum, from 44\u00a0% to 90\u00a0%. Observed inhibitions were, however, reduced by 'Atena Polka' cultivation, and as high as 32\u00a0% promotion in root length was noted. Amendment with urban sediment, in turn, resulted in an initial 1\u00a0%-36\u00a0% promotion of root growth, while 'Atena Polka' cultivation reduced this positive effect by inhibition as high as 26\u00a0%. Results demonstrated positive influence of 'Atena Polka' on the phytotoxicity alleviation and mitigation of total and TEQ PCDD\/PCDF concentrations in soil treated with bio-solids from sewage sludge and an urban reservoir.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000649f","authors":["Magdalena Urbaniak","Anna Wyrwicka","Marek Zieli\u0144ski","Joanna Mankiewicz-Boczek"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00128-016-1868-6","endpage":"406","first_seen_on":"2016-08-10T01:48:06+00:00","issns":["1432-0800"],"issue":"3","journal":"Bulletin of Environmental Contamination & Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1470793666,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00128-016-1868-6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00128-016-1868-6.pdf","pmid":"27365136","pubdate":"2016-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ecotoxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pollution, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Soil Science & Conservation","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Waste Water Technology \/ Water Pollution Control \/ Water Management \/ Aquatic Pollution","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"401","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Potential for Phytoremediation of PCDD\/PCDF-Contaminated Sludge and Sediments Using Cucurbitaceae Plants: A Pilot Study","type":"article","volume":"97","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-phytoremediation-pcddpcdfcontaminated-sludge-sediments-using-cucurbitaceae-plants-pilot-st"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8192854,"mean":6.9262032168704,"rank":7089968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8192854,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257284,"mean":11.985265960051,"rank":217404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257284,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2099,"mean":2.7032755004766,"rank":1616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2099,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":1.2575438596491,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
