Forty-eight consecutive non-demented ALS patients (mean age =\u200952.93\u2009\u00b1\u200912.37) were followed for five years. All patients underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessments at baseline visit. Further, a yearly follow-up check for associated dementia (ALS-Dem) was completed and the time of death was recorded, when applicable. Executive deficits were shown in 49.5% of ALS patients, with the most striking differences found on the tests of verbal fluency (both phonemic and category, p\u2009<\u20090.01); as well as inefficient strategy on a working memory test (p\u2009<\u20090.05); as on the more demanding levels of the planning and problem solving task (p\u2009<\u20090.01). It appears that the baseline executive status might predict survival in ALS (p\u2009=\u20090.075), and the patients presenting executive dysfunction could have up to three times greater risk of death, after adjustment by several potential confounding factors. In conclusion, this study suggests that executive dysfunction could potentially influence survival in ALS patients. The cognitive testing might give us important clues about the prognosis of the disease. Further studies with larger sample size are necessary.","altmetric_jid":"56dd9b6e2a83ee7d288b456f","authors":["Tanja Stojkovic","Stojkovic, Tanja","Stefanova, Elka","Pekmezovic, Tatjana","Peric, Stojan","Stevic, Zorica"],"doi":"10.1080\/21678421.2016.1211148","endpage":"5","first_seen_on":"2016-08-10T01:23:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2167-9223","2167-8421"],"journal":"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration","last_mentioned_on":1471043670,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/21678421.2016.1211148","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27494074"],"pmid":"27494074","pubdate":"2016-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Executive dysfunction and survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Preliminary report from a Serbian centre for motor neuron disease","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/executive-dysfunction-survival-patients-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-preliminary-report-serbian-cen-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204367,"mean":6.945700472644,"rank":890471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7301914,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204367,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257360,"mean":11.980511332419,"rank":40756,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":215848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257360,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285,"mean":8.1981690140845,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":8.175,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hellbrat\/statuses\/763183960004243456","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10363707],"posted_on":"2016-08-10T01:23:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Helen Barratt","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/toxicbluegreenalgae\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/577072190186606592\/YlAn8wDO_normal.jpeg","description":"All blue green algae including spirulina are cyanobacteria that can produce the cyanotoxin BMAA linked to ALS MND Alzheimers & Parkinsons diseases.","id_on_source":"hellbrat","tweeter_id":"36312804","geo":{"lt":-28.64201,"ln":153.61194,"country":"AU"},"followers":2395},"tweet_id":"763183960004243456"}],"news":[{"title":"Executive dysfunction and survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Preliminary report from a Serbian centre for motor neuron disease.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=27596152735&p=1pl&v=1&x=F0UYYFHd4rrveNYSQjyPyw","license":"public","citation_ids":[10363707],"posted_on":"2016-08-12T23:14:30+00:00","summary":".
