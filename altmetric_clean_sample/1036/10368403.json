Therapies exclusively targeting large caliber arterial vasospasm have fallen short, and thus we asked whether capillary dysfunction contributes to delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Using a mouse model of subarachnoid hemorrhage and two-photon microscopy we showed capillary dysfunction unrelated to upstream arterial constriction. Subarachnoid hemorrhage decreased RBC velocity by 30%, decreased capillary pulsatility by 50%, and increased length of non-perfusing capillaries by 15%. This was accompanied by severe brain hypoxia and neuronal loss. Hyaluronidase, an enzyme that alters capillary blood flow by removing the luminal glycocalyx, returned RBC velocity and pulsatility to normal. Hyaluronidase also reversed brain hypoxia and prevented neuron loss typically seen after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Thus, subarachnoid hemorrhage causes specific changes in capillary RBC flow independent of arterial spasm, and hyaluronidase treatment that normalizes capillary blood flow can prevent brain hypoxia and injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Prevention or treatment of capillary dysfunction after subarachnoid hemorrhage may reduce the incidence or severity of subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced delayed cerebral ischemia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce7","authors":["McConnell, Evan D","Wei, Helen S","Reitz, Katherine M","Kang, Hongyi","Takano, Takahiro","Vates, G Edward","Nedergaard, Maiken","Evan D McConnell","Helen S Wei","Katherine M Reitz","Hongyi Kang","Takahiro Takano","G Edward Vates","Maiken Nedergaard"],"doi":"10.1177\/0271678x15608389","first_seen_on":"2016-08-10T08:02:12+00:00","issns":["1559-7016","0271-678X"],"journal":"Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1501952226,"links":["http:\/\/jcb.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/12\/07\/0271678X15608389.full?platform=hootsuite","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26661183?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26661183","pubdate":"2015-10-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"0271678X15608389","subjects":["metabolism","brain"],"title":"Cerebral microcirculatory failure after subarachnoid hemorrhage is reversed by hyaluronidase","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cerebral-microcirculatory-failure-after-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-reversed-hyaluronidase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8324953,"mean":7.0165383958894,"rank":3573435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4715057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8324953,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258955,"mean":11.980141608162,"rank":102360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":154738,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258955,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1403,"mean":5.0321312410842,"rank":704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1403,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":3.9721794871795,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
