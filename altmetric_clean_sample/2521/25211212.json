The hexagonal compound SrRu2O6 has a relatively high Neel temperature but small local moments, which seem to be at odds with the nominal valence of Ru(5+) in the [Formula: see text] configuration. Here, we investigate the electronic property of SrRu2O6 using density functional theory (DFT) combined with dynamical-mean-field theory (DMFT). We find that the strong hybridization between Ru d and O p states results in a Ru valence that is closer to +4, leading to the small ordered moment ~1.2\u2009\u03bc B . While this is consistent with a DFT prediction, correlation effects are found to play a significant role. The local moment per Ru site remains finite ~2.3\u2009\u03bc B in the whole temperature range investigated. Due to the lower symmetry, the t 2g manifold is split and the quasiparticle weight is renormalized significantly in the a 1g state, while the renormalization in [Formula: see text] states is about a factor of 2-3 weaker. Our theoretical Neel temperature ~700\u2009K is in reasonable agreement with experimental observations. SrRu2O6 is a unique system in which localized and itinerant electrons coexist with the proximity to an orbitally-selective Mott transition within the t 2g sector.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Satoshi Okamoto","Masayuki Ochi","Ryotaro Arita","Jiaqiang Yan","Nandini Trivedi"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-08503-y","first_seen_on":"2017-09-13T20:26:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1505334384,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-08503-y?WT.feed_name=subjects_materials-science"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-08503-y.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5597611","pmid":"28904351","pubdate":"2017-09-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"11742","subjects":["science"],"title":"Localized-itinerant dichotomy and unconventional magnetism in SrRu2O6","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/localizeditinerant-dichotomy-unconventional-magnetism-srru2o6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409376,"mean":7.0790526953473,"rank":7268130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409376,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125794,"mean":11.706989959696,"rank":102148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125794,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37455,"mean":14.710448924014,"rank":31144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37455,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2566,"mean":11.177094736842,"rank":2019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2566,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Physics and Astronomy":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BlackPhysicists\/statuses\/908064341878034433","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25211212],"posted_on":"2017-09-13T20:26:24+00:00","author":{"name":"BlackPhysicists","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/502208695854313472\/mupwPlOC_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"BlackPhysicists","tweeter_id":"46854930","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":16477},"tweet_id":"908064341878034433"}]}}
