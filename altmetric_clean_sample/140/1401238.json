Sleep apnea headache may emerge de novo or may present as an exacerbation of cluster, migraine, tension-type, or other headache. Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep disorder in chronic migraine and tension-type headache, and increases risk for depression and anxiety. Sleep disturbance (e.g., sleep loss, oversleeping, schedule shift) is an acute headache trigger for migraine and tension-type headache. Snoring and sleep disturbance are independent risk factors for progression from episodic to chronic headache.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005695","authors":["Rains JC","Poceta JS"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ncl.2012.08.014","first_seen_on":"2013-04-20T12:50:31+00:00","issns":["0733-8619"],"issue":"4","journal":"Neurologic clinics","last_mentioned_on":1366462142,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23099138?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23099138","pubdate":"2012-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Sleep-related headaches.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sleeprelated-headaches"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3076560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":955006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88841,"mean":6.9493379333635,"rank":60041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":18437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88841,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170,"mean":2.5014792899408,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
