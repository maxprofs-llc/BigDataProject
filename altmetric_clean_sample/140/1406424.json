The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the level of knowledge and attitudes on occupational exposure in primary health care. In 2009, a total of 100 health care workers from the Primary Health Care Centre in In\u0111ija, Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Serbia were included in the study. The results suggested that the health care workers who participated in the survey possess basic knowledge about blood-borne virus transmission routes. Most incorrect answers were related to the transmission of blood-borne viruses by tears, saliva, urine and stool. This study also demonstrated that health workers tend to unrealistically estimate the risk of HIV infections. As for the level of education about the prevention and control of blood-borne infections, 49 % of the participants had never had any education on this topic, while 22 % had been educated during the last five years. Around 75 % consider education on blood-borne infection and protective measures at work unnecessary.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51b3cf058f610003919","authors":["Gaji\u0107 Z","Raj\u010devi\u0107 S","Duri\u0107 P","Ili\u0107 S","Dugand\u017eija T"],"doi":"10.2478\/10004-1254-64-2013-2268","first_seen_on":"2013-04-23T12:18:35+00:00","issns":["0004-1254"],"issue":"1","journal":"Archives of Industrial Hygiene & Toxicology \/ Arhiv za Higijenu Rada I Toksikologiju","last_mentioned_on":1430202918,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23585167","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2478\/10004-1254-64-2013-2268"],"pmid":"23585167","pubdate":"2013-04-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Science And Management","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["occupationalmedicine"],"title":"Knowledge and Attitudes of Health Care Workers from the Primary Health Centre in In\u0111ija, Serbia on Professional Exposures to Blood-borne Infections","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/knowledge-attitudes-health-care-workers-primary-health-centre-in%C4%91ija-serbia-professional-exposures-b"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5032449,"mean":5.9702691497267,"rank":4186504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5032449,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92888,"mean":7.0927192179745,"rank":75554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92888,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":1.8532258064516,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.0833333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
