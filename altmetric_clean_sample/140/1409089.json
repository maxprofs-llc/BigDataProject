Mutations in mitochondrial DNA, particularly in MT-CYB coding for cytochrome B in complex III (CIII), have been associated with isolated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We hypothesized that MT-CYB mutations might play an important causal or modifying role in HCM. The MT-CYB gene was sequenced from DNA isolated from blood from 91 Danish HCM probands. Nonsynonymous variants were analyzed by bioinformatics, molecular modeling and simulation. Two germline-inherited, putative disease-causing, nonsynonymous variants: m.15024G>A; p.C93Y and m.15482T>C; p.S246P were identified. Modeling showed that the p.C93Y mutation leads to disruption of the tertiary structure of Cytb by helix displacement, interfering with protein-heme interaction. The p.S246P mutation induces a diproline structure, which alters local secondary structure and induces a kink in the protein backbone, interfering with macromolecular interactions. These molecular effects are compatible with a leaky phenotype, that is, limited but progressive mitochondrial dysfunction. In conclusion, we find that rare, putative leaky mtDNA variants in MT-CYB can be identified in a cohort of HCM patients. We propose that further patients with HCM should be examined for mutations in MT-CYB in order to clarify the role of these variants.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"53222dc92a83ee27268b4589","authors":["Hagen, Christian M.","Aidt, Frederik H.","Havndrup, Ole","Hedley, Paula L.","Jespersgaard, Cathrine","Jensen, Morten","Kanters, J\u00f8rgen K.","Moolman\u2010Smook, Johanna C.","M\u00f8ller, Daniel V.","Bundgaard, Henning","Christiansen, Michael"],"doi":"10.1002\/mgg3.5","endpage":"65","first_seen_on":"2013-04-24T13:18:38+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["2324-9269",""],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Genetics & Genomic Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1368767474,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mgg3.5\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mgg3.5\/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+18+May+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mgg3.5\/pdf","pmid":"24498601","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"54","title":"MT\u00e2\u0080\u0090CYB mutations in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mtcyb-mutations-hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.572,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.572},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6696465,"mean":6.1599590282253,"rank":767376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":5929142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6696465,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112851,"mean":6.6144286220648,"rank":14396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":98455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112851,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145,"mean":5.1799305555556,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
