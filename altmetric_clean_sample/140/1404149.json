Docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n3, DHA) is an n-3 PUFA known to affect numerous biological functions and provide cardioprotection; however, the exact molecular and cellular protective mechanism(s) remain unknown. In contrast, DHA also possesses many anti-tumorgenic properties including suppressing cell growth and inducing apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the effect of DHA toward H9c2 cells (an immortalized cardiac cell line) and neonatal primary cardiomyocytes (NCM). Cells were treated with 0\u03bcM, 10\u03bcM or 100\u03bcM DHA for upto 48h. Cell viability and mitochondrial activity were assayed at different time points. DHA caused a significant time- and dose-dependent decrease in cell viability and mitochondrial activity in H9c2 cells but not NCM. In addition, DHA decreased levels of TGF-\u03b21 but increased IL-6 release in H9c2 cells. Significant induction of apoptosis was observed only in H9c2 cells, which involved activation of caspase-8 and -3 activities with a marked release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. DHA-induced severe mitochondrial damage resulting in a fragmented and punctated morphology with corresponding loss of mitochondrial membrane potential within 3h, prior to activation of caspases and cytochrome c release at 6h in H9c2 cells. Our data indicate that DHA treatment targets mitochondria, triggering collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, increasing cellular stress and mitochondrial fragmentation resulting in apoptosis in immortalized cardiac cells, H9c2, but not neonatal primary cardiomyocyte.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000367d","authors":["Qadhi R","Alsaleh N","Samokhvalov V","El-Sikhry H","Bellenger J","Seubert JM"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.toxlet.2013.03.010","first_seen_on":"2013-04-22T15:04:13+00:00","issns":["0378-4274"],"issue":"","journal":"Toxicology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1366642935,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23523905"],"pmid":"23523905","pubdate":"2013-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Science And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Differential Responses to Docosahexaenoic Acid in Primary and Immortalized Cardiac Cells.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differential-responses-docosahexaenoic-acid-primary-immortalized-cardiac-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3076464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":954753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88657,"mean":6.957453077062,"rank":59982,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":18353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88657,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":699,"mean":2.4020687679083,"rank":422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":699,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":0.75454545454545,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/alexchat\/statuses\/326350242008137729","license":"public","citation_ids":[1404149],"posted_on":"2013-04-22T15:02:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Remembrane Srl","url":"http:\/\/www.remembrane.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2658956715\/219212eca24cec5f0fa9ef1922f3f84d_normal.jpeg","description":"Remembrane leads the cell culture technology a step foward, by envisaging the cell membrane network as a fundamental actor of many cellular processes.","id_on_source":"alexchat","tweeter_id":"78475091","geo":{"lt":44.49381,"ln":11.33875,"country":"IT"},"followers":80},"tweet_id":"326350242008137729"}]}}
