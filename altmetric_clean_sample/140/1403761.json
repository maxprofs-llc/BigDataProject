Sometimes, medicine is worth the hard work and effort."],"citation":{"abstract":"A virus found in the sera of Pekin ducks appears to be a new member of the human hepatitis B-like family of viruses. This virus had a diameter of 40 nm and an appearance in the electron microscope similar to that of human hepatitis B virus. The DNA genome of the virus was circular and partially single stranded, and an endogenous DNA polymerase associated with the virus was capable of converting the genome to a double-stranded circle with a size of ca. 3,000 base pairs. An analysis for viral DNA in the organs of infected birds indicated preferential localization in the liver, implicating this organ as the site of virus replication. In all of these aspects, the virus bears a striking resemblance to human hepatitis B virus and appears to be a new member of this family, which also includes ground squirrel hepatitis virus and woodchuck hepatitis virus.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["W S Mason","G Seal","J Summers","Mason, W S","Seal, G","Summers, J"],"first_seen_on":"2013-04-22T11:34:40+00:00","issns":["0022-538X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1485621624,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC353710\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7463557"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC353710\/pdf\/jvirol00180-0205.pdf","pmcid":"PMC353710","pmid":"7463557","pubdate":"1980-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology (ASM)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"829","title":"Virus of Pekin ducks with structural and biological relatedness to human hepatitis B virus.","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/virus-pekin-ducks-structural-biological-relatedness-human-hepatitis-b-virus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8137857,"mean":6.8794880300098,"rank":1764209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6316284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8137857,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119122,"mean":6.9015631500744,"rank":26643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":91764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119122,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6815,"mean":4.2584349867919,"rank":1236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5501,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6815,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":4.5961071428571,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
