Factors such as climate, CO2 levels and region are known to affect polyphenolic compounds in wine; therefore a pilot study was conducted to focus on the Australian climate which has shifted from El Ni\u00f1o to La Ni\u00f1a. This research paper presents the influence of climate conditions and growing regions on the in vitro and ex vivo antioxidant capacity of red and white wine and the profile and concentration of polyphenols in these wines from the 2008 and 2009 vintages. The ORAC and polyphenolic data show that warmer climate wines had lower in vitro antioxidant capacity values but retained good bioavailability based on data from the RBC ex vivo assay compared to cool climate wines. Based on this pilot study, further research is being conducted at the National Measurement Institute, Australia (NMIA) with the goal of determining more polyphenolic compounds which appear to be affected by climate conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f5","authors":["Stockham K","Sheard A","Paimin R","Buddhadasa S","Duong S","Orbell JD","Murdoch T"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.foodchem.2013.01.006","endpage":"506","first_seen_on":"2013-04-23T11:15:09+00:00","issns":["0308-8146","03088146"],"issue":"3","journal":"Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1366715607,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23601398?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23601398","pubdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"500","subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Comparative studies on the antioxidant properties and polyphenolic content of wine from different growing regions and vintages, a pilot study to investigate chemical markers for climate change.","type":"article","volume":"140","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-studies-antioxidant-properties-polyphenolic-content-wine-different-growing-regions-vinta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6378189,"mean":5.9866683057946,"rank":4715662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":946547,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6378189,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98974,"mean":7.1309870570762,"rank":66438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":18232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98974,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2788,"mean":3.3232981700753,"rank":1569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2788,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":6.0925882352941,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
