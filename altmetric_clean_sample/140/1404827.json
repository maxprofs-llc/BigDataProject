Our study demonstrates that in neonatal mice NLF significantly limits mitochondrial calcium influx, the event associated with protection of the brain against hypoxic-ischemic insult (HI). Compared to the vehicle-treated mice, cerebral mitochondria from NLF-treated mice exhibited a significantly greater tolerance to the Ca(2+)-induced membrane permeabilization, greater ADP-phosphorylating activity and reduced cytochrome C release during reperfusion. Pre-treatment with NLF or Ruthenium red (RuR) significantly improved viability of murine hippocampal HT-22 cells, reduced Ca(2+) content and preserved membrane potential (\u03a8m) in mitochondria following oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Following histamine-stimulated Ca(2+) release from endoplasmic reticulum, in contrast to the vehicle-treated cells, the cells treated with NLF or RuR also demonstrated reduced Ca(2+) content in their mitochondria, the event associated with preserved \u03a8m. Because RuR inhibits mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter, we tested whether the NLF acts via the mechanism similar to the RuR. However, in contrast to the RuR, in the experiment with direct interaction of these agents with mitochondria isolated from na\u00efve mice, the NLF did not alter mitochondrial Ca(2+) influx, and did not prevent Ca(2+) induced collapse of the \u03a8m. These data strongly argues against interaction of NLF and mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter. Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, our study is the first to show that NLF inhibits intramitochondrial Ca(2+) flux and protects developing brain against HI-reperfusion injury. This novel action of NLF has important clinical implication, because it targets a fundamental mechanism of post-ischemic cell death: intramitochondrial Ca(2+) overload \u2192 mitochondrial membrane permeabilization \u2192 secondary energy failure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Irina V.
