There are four modalities available for treatment: expectant management, radiosurgery, embolization, and microsurgery. In order to make a decision about treatment, the surgeon must consider the natural history of the lesion versus the rate of treated morbidity and mortality. Characteristics of temporal lobe AVMs such as their location, the potential for deep-seated arterial feeders and deep venous drainage, increase the risk of early clinical onset, hemorrhage, and overall morbidity and mortality (Fleetwood and Steinberg; Lancet 359:863-873, 3) and provide an additional challenge to surgeons attempting to remove the lesion while preserving eloquent local structures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002157","doi":"10.1007\/s00701-013-1710-4","first_seen_on":"2013-04-23T19:39:55+00:00","issns":["0942-0940"],"journal":"Acta Neurochirurgica","last_mentioned_on":1366745889,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23605372"],"pmid":"23605372","pubdate":"2013-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Interventional Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Minimally Invasive Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neuroradiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgical Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"Resection of lateral temporal lobe arteriovenous malformations.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resection-lateral-temporal-lobe-arteriovenous-malformations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629051,"mean":4.9368884016521,"rank":1808513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1643891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629051,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84553,"mean":6.7220811335038,"rank":37340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":42079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84553,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248,"mean":2.4088502024291,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.0416666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
