PCAF is also a transcriptional coactivator. Due to the lack of a PCAF KAT-specific small molecule inhibitor, the exclusive role of the acetyltransferase activity of PCAF is not well understood. Here, we report that a natural compound of the hydroxybenzoquinone class, embelin, specifically inhibits H3Lys9 acetylation in mice and inhibits recombinant PCAF-mediated acetylation with near complete specificity in vitro. Furthermore, using embelin, we have identified the gene networks that are regulated by PCAF during muscle differentiation, further highlighting the broader regulatory functions of PCAF in muscle differentiation in addition to the regulation via MyoD acetylation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006811","authors":["Rahul Modak"],"doi":"10.1021\/cb4000597","first_seen_on":"2013-04-22T04:01:35+00:00","issns":["1554-8929"],"journal":"ACS Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1366603197,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/cb4000597"],"pmid":"23570531","pubdate":"2013-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","biochemistry"],"title":"Probing p300\/CBP Associated Factor (PCAF)-Dependent Pathways with a Small Molecule Inhibitor","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/probing-p300cbp-associated-factor-pcafdependent-pathways-small-molecule-inhibitor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002981,"mean":6.7515998143141,"rank":3974491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3824421,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002981,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118338,"mean":6.7882620482183,"rank":53120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":61621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118338,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1602,"mean":4.3657988757027,"rank":742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1602,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":4.582,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
