We articulated key RE-AIM criteria by reviewing the published literature from 1999 to 2010 in several databases to describe the application and reporting on various RE-AIM dimensions. After excluding nonempirical articles, case studies, and commentaries, 71 articles were identified. The most frequent publications were on physical activity, obesity, and disease management. Four articles reported solely on 1 dimension compared with 44 articles that reported on all 5 dimensions of the framework. RE-AIM was broadly applied, but several criteria were not reported consistently.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221a","authors":["Gaglio B","Shoup JA","Glasgow RE"],"doi":"10.2105\/ajph.2013.301299","first_seen_on":"2013-04-24T14:06:10+00:00","issns":["0090-0036"],"issue":"","journal":"American Journal of Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1374763620,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23597377","http:\/\/ajph.aphapublications.org\/doi\/abs\/10.2105\/AJPH.2013.301299"],"pmid":"23597377","pubdate":"2013-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"The RE-AIM Framework: A Systematic Review of Use Over Time.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reaim-framework-systematic-review-time-21"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7138505,"mean":6.3042622734369,"rank":1370310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5758558,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7138505,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114450,"mean":6.6569630490438,"rank":23076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":91148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114450,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7285,"mean":14.119472267985,"rank":2780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7285,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":15.228385321101,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":14,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":36,"Student  > Doctoral Student":15,"Student  > Ph.
