The ability of STAT1 to act as a pro- or anti-apoptotic signaling molecule depends upon the cellular environment and stimulus. Post-translational modifications provide the main method of control over the function of STAT1, however, recent data in the breast has shown that loss of STAT1 from both the tumor and the surrounding mammary epithelium greatly influence the development and response to treatment of breast cancers. Here, we discuss the recent findings of Chan et al. in Breast Cancer Research who described a new role for STAT1 in the development of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive luminal breast cancers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"536246132a83ee225b8b4590","authors":["Sarah G.
