Participants also completed free text questions. The scale and free text data were often contradictory and the results highlighted three processes to account for these disparities: i) frame of reference: current salient issues influenced how questions were interpreted; ii) within-subject comparisons: ratings were based on expectations given past experiences; iii) time frame: those with more stable circumstances showed habituation to their level of deprivation. Likert scale data should be understood within the context of how ratings are made.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd2","authors":["Jane Ogden","Jessica Lo","Ogden J","Lo J"],"doi":"10.1177\/1359105311417192","endpage":"361","first_seen_on":"2013-04-23T13:24:03+00:00","issns":["1461-7277","1359-1053"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Health Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1366723329,"links":["http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/17\/3\/350.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/17\/3\/350.full.pdf","pmid":"21824896","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Sage","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"350","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"How meaningful are data from Likert scales?
