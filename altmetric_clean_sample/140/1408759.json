Hyperserotoninaemia in 43.5%, lactic acidosis 43% and hyperpyruvataemia in 30% were biochemically demonstrated in autistic children. Our earlier results led to the postulation that a dissequilibrium in the blood redox is involved in infantile autism; the oxidative loading and the antioxidant defending enzyme system were investigated together with the hemorheological parameters in infantile autism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000cfae","first_seen_on":"2013-04-24T10:56:55+00:00","issns":["0019-1442"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Ideggy\u00f3gy\u00e1szati szemle","last_mentioned_on":1383252906,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23607226"],"pmid":"23607226","pubdate":"2013-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Blood lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme activities and hemorheological changes in autistic children.","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blood-lipid-peroxidation-antioxidant-enzyme-activities-hemorheological-changes-autistic-children-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4022308,"mean":5.0456959241201,"rank":1588109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2413439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4022308,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86158,"mean":6.7809163503836,"rank":27939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":57578,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86158,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.030303030303,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.4166666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"googleplus":[{"title":"There exists an oxidative stress in children with infantile autism http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed...","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/117039982486463637415\/posts\/ZJgQUn9kh3F","citation_ids":[1408759],"posted_on":"2013-04-24T11:52:44+00:00","summary":"There exists an oxidative stress in children with infantile autism http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed...
