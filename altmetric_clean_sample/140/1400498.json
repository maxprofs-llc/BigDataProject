We obtained the operating costs of the most utilized patient assistance program. Patients who utilized patient assistance programs were significantly more likely to be English speaking (p=0.04) and have 1.5\u00a0years more advanced schooling than non-utilizers (p=0.008). At the cost of 73 dollars per hour encounters, patients reported benefiting the most from information resources (71% of patients) followed by emotional support (52% of patients); 5% of patients reported getting help with insurance, 5% with financial assistance, 4% with help obtaining medication, 2% with transportation. Existing comprehensive patient assistance programs offer informational, psychological and financial support at low cost. Patients who currently use these programs are English speakers with more education.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8113cf058f61000bb46","authors":["Stey, Anne M","Anne M Stey","Kezhen Fei","Rebeca Franco","Ali Mendelson","Nina A Bickell"],"doi":"10.1186\/2193-1801-2-173","first_seen_on":"2013-04-19T22:32:15+00:00","issns":["2193-1801"],"issue":"1","journal":"SpringerPlus","last_mentioned_on":1371823506,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerplus.com\/content\/2\/1\/173\/abstract","http:\/\/www.springerplus.com\/content\/2\/1\/173"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/springerplus.springeropen.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/2193-1801-2-173?site=springerplus.springeropen.com","pmcid":"PMC3650234","pmid":"23667818","pubdate":"2013-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","startpage":"173","title":"Cost of comprehensive patient assistance program in early breast cancer patients","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cost-comprehensive-patient-assistance-program-early-breast-cancer-patients-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8292280,"mean":6.9874882067939,"rank":2117599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5043890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8292280,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120152,"mean":6.95969689807,"rank":32137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":82495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120152,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1724,"mean":3.2882333139872,"rank":326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":1372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1724,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.93846153846154,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Decision Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"googleplus":[{"title":"In our #BreastCancer Collection: #NewYork study into the cost of comprehensive assistance programs http...","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/108618215708546149812\/posts\/FLTvwxCUvAK","citation_ids":[1400498],"posted_on":"2013-06-20T17:01:43+00:00","summary":"In our #BreastCancer Collection: #NewYork study into the cost of comprehensive assistance programs http...
