There are widespread neural interactions in unilateral (one) IC and between bilateral (two) ICs that could modulate auditory signal processing such as the amplitude and frequency selectivity of IC neurons. These neural interactions are either inhibitory or excitatory, and are mostly mediated by \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate, respectively. However, the majority of interactions are inhibitory while excitatory interactions are in the minority. Such unbalanced properties between excitatory and inhibitory projections have an important role in the formation of unilateral auditory dominance and sound location, and the neural interaction in one IC and between two ICs provide an adjustable and plastic modulation pattern for auditory signal processing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc12","authors":["Hui-Xian Mei","Liang Cheng","Qi-Cai Chen"],"doi":"10.3389\/fncir.2013.00068","first_seen_on":"2013-04-22T06:42:57+00:00","issns":["1662-5110"],"journal":"Frontiers in Neural Circuits","last_mentioned_on":1366612770,"links":["http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Neural_Circuits\/10.3389\/fncir.2013.00068\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/DownloadFile\/1\/83814\/32253\/1\/21\/fncir-07-00068_pdf","pmid":"23626523","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Neural interactions in unilateral colliculus and between bilateral colliculi modulate auditory signal processing","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neural-interactions-unilateral-colliculus-between-bilateral-colliculi-modulate-auditory-signal-proce"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3552480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88658,"mean":6.9574400216566,"rank":70303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88658,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":388,"mean":2.5193126614987,"rank":312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":388,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
