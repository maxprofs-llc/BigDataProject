We designed and constructed an experimental setup to investigate physical and chemical processes caused by the flow of reactive and volatile fluids such as supercritical CO(2) and\/or H(2)S in geological formations. Potential applications are geological sequestration of CO(2) in the frame of carbon capture and storage and acid-gas injection for sulfur disposal and\/or enhanced oil recovery. The present paper outlines the design criteria and the realization of reactive transport experiments on the laboratory scale. We focus on the spatial and time evolution of rock and fluid composition as a result of chemical rock fluid interaction and the coupling of chemistry and fluid flow in porous rocks.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012RScI...83h4501O","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003488","authors":["Ott, H.","de Kloe, K.","van Bakel, M.","Vos, F.","van Pelt, A.","Legerstee, P.","Bauer, A.","Eide, K.","van der Linden, A.","Berg, S.","Makurat, A."],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4746997","first_seen_on":"2013-04-20T16:32:53+00:00","issns":["0034-6748"],"journal":"Review of Scientific Instruments","last_mentioned_on":1366475461,"links":["http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/iel5\/4915264\/6257347\/06287727.pdf?arnumber=6287727"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/iel5\/4915264\/6257347\/06287727.pdf?arnumber=6287727","pmid":"22938317","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AIP","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biophysics","biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Core-flood experiment for transport of reactive fluids in rocks","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coreflood-experiment-transport-reactive-fluids-rocks"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629660,"mean":4.9331369641107,"rank":2015959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629660,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84892,"mean":6.7062912676257,"rank":43696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":25856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84892,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":589,"mean":4.5226258503401,"rank":308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":589,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":3.0111111111111,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
