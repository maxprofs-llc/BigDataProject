Handgrip exercise (HGEX) is emerging as a useful tool to increase shear stress for FMD assessment; however, the impact of acute mental stress on HGEX-FMD is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether acute mental stress attenuates RH- and HGEX-induced BA-FMD to a similar extent. In 2 counterbalanced visits, 16 healthy males (19-27 years of age) performed RH-FMD or HGEX-FMD tests after a counting control task (prestress FMD) and a speech and arithmetic stress task (poststress FMD). BA diameter and mean blood velocity were assessed with echo and Doppler ultrasound, respectively. Shear stress was estimated using shear rate (SR = BA blood velocity\/BA diameter). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and salivary cortisol were used to assess stress reactivity. Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SE. The stress task elevated MAP (\u039424.0 \u00b1 2.6 mm Hg) and HR (\u039415.5 \u00b1 1.9 beats\u00b7min(-1)), but not cortisol (prestress vs. poststress: 4.4 \u00b1 0.7 nmol\u00b7L(-1) vs. 4.7 \u00b1 0.7 nmol\u00b7L(-1); p = 0.625). There was no difference between the pre- and poststress SR stimulus for RH (p = 0.115) or HGEX (p = 0.664). RH-FMD decreased from 5.2% \u00b1 0.6% prestress to 4.1% \u00b1 0.5% poststress (p = 0.071); however, stress did not attenuate HGEX-FMD (prestress vs. poststress: 4.1% \u00b1 0.6% vs. 5.3% \u00b1 0.6%; p = 0.154). The pre- to poststress change in FMD was significantly different in the RH-FMD vs. the HGEX-FMD test (-1.1% \u00b1 0.6% vs. +1.1% \u00b1 0.8%; p = 0.015). In conclusion, acute mental stress appears to have a disparate impact on FMD stimulated by RH vs. HGEX induced increases in shear stress.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000ceb","authors":["Ingrid C.
