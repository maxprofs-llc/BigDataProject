It also plays a critical role in pathophysiological states including those of obesity and diabetes. Recent evidence has highlighted the potential for targeting the circadian clock as a potential drug target. New studies have also demonstrated the existence of \"clock-independent effects\" of the circadian proteins, leading to exciting new avenues of research in the circadian clock field in physiology. The goal of this review is to provide an introduction to and overview of the circadian clock in physiology, including mechanisms, targets, and role in disease states. The role of the circadian clocks in the regulation of the cardiovascular system, renal function, metabolism, the endocrine system, immune, and reproductive systems will be discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002212","authors":["Jacob Richards","Michelle L Gumz"],"doi":"10.1152\/ajpregu.00066.2013","first_seen_on":"2013-04-20T05:28:50+00:00","issns":["1522-1490"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology: Regulatory, Integrative & Comparative Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1366435643,"links":["http:\/\/ajpregu.physiology.org\/content\/early\/2013\/04\/10\/ajpregu.00066.2013.abstract?papetoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajpregu.physiology.org\/content\/early\/2013\/04\/10\/ajpregu.00066.2013.full.pdf","pmid":"23576606","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Invited Review EB 2012: Mechanism of the Circadian Clock in Physiology","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanism-circadian-clock-physiology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":2670520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1694959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93123,"mean":7.1053354738946,"rank":46294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":34922,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93123,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":996,"mean":4.9924502512563,"rank":473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":996,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.2065555555556,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
