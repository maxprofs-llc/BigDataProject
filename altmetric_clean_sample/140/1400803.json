There is strong evidence that vegetables and fruits protect against these diseases; however, the active constituents are incompletely identified. Whether fat per se is a major cause of disease is a question still under debate, although saturated and partially hydrogenated fats probably increase the risk of coronary heart disease. One clear conclusion from existing epidemiologic evidence is that many individuals in the United States have suboptimal diets and that the potential for disease prevention by improved nutrition is substantial.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1994Sci...264..532W","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Willett, W C","WC Willett"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.8160011","endpage":"537","first_seen_on":"2013-04-20T04:08:00+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0036-8075","1095-9203"],"issue":"5158","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1458341978,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8160011","http:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/264\/5158\/532","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.8160011"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/sci\/264\/5158\/532.full.pdf","pmid":"8160011","pubdate":"1994-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"532","subjects":["science"],"title":"Diet and health: what should we eat?","type":"article","volume":"264","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diet-health-we-eat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7408484,"mean":6.4406978049309,"rank":906868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":6481363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7408484,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115831,"mean":6.6830153155488,"rank":15516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":100002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115831,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39071,"mean":30.575595546455,"rank":15583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":23366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39071,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":757,"mean":41.163087301587,"rank":395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":757,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":23,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
