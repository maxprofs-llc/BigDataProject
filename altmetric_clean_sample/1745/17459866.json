Sixteen male cyclists received a ketogenic diet for two days and were divided into two equal groups: a group taking AA-KAAA (KA) or a control group (PL). The athletes performed a two hour cycling session followed by a maximum incremental test until voluntary exhaustion (VExh). Blood samples were obtained at rest and during exercise for further hematological and biochemical analyses. Exercise-induced ammonemia increased in the PL group at VExh (75%) but remained unchanged in the KA group. Both groups exhibited a significant increase in leukocyte and neutrophil counts of \u223c85% (\u223c13 \u00d7 10(9) L(-1)), but the shape of the lymphocytes and the eosinophil counts suggest that AA-KAAA supplementation helps prevent lymphocytosis. AA-KAAA supplementation induced a decrease in creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase levels at VExh while showing a significant decrease in lactate dehydrogenase at 120 min. We found that AA-KAAA supplementation decreases both the lymphocyte count response in blood and the established biomarkers of muscle damage after intense exercise under a low heat stress environment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f610007461","authors":["Rafaela Carvalho Pereira Lima","Saulo Rodrigo Alves e Silva Camerino","Th\u00e1ssia Casado Lima Fran\u00e7a","Daniela Souza Ara\u00fajo Rodrigues","Marcos Guilherme de Sousa Gouveia","Adriana Ximenes-da-Silva","Adriana Bassini","Eduardo Seixas Prado","Luiz-Claudio Cameron","R.
