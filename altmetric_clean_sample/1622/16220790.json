The mean purging rate in cholera was 60.1 ml, in ETEC 39.2 ml, and in rotavirus infection 31.4 ml\/kg\/8 hour. The mean stool sodium concentration in cholera was 88.9 mMol\/L, in ETEC 53.7 mMol\/L, and in rotavirus infection 37.2 mMol\/L. Stool potassium concentration did not show much variation, Mean CO2 concentration in rotavirus infection was 6 mMol\/L, significantly lower than in cholera and in ETEC diarrhea. In cholera, stool sodium concentration increased significantly with increase in purging rates; the same was not true in rotavirus and ETEC diarrhea. These differences are considered important factors in formulating replacement therapy in diarrhea.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a88","authors":["A. Majid Molla","Mizanur Rhman","S.
