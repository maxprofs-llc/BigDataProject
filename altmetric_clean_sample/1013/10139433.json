The verbal fluency task (VFT) was administered while subjects were undergoing near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) scanning. The purpose of VFT was to examine the functions of the frontal and temporal lobes.\nSubjects included 145 drug-na\u00efve patients with SAD and 152 healthy controls (HCs). All subjects underwent psychological testing to determine levels of anxiety and depression and to evaluate cognition.\nThe scores of patients with SAD indicated significantly higher anxiety and depressive states than those in HCs on several measures: Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), Profile of Mood States (POMS), Spielberger Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Social Adaptation Self-evaluation Scale (SASS). The patients with SAD also had higher scores on the future denial, threat prediction, self-denial, past denial, and interpersonal threat sections of the Depression and Anxiety Cognition Scale (DACS). NIRS scanning revealed hyperactivity in the left frontal cortex of patients with SAD. Threat prediction scores on DACS were negatively correlated with oxy-Hb responses in the right frontal cortex.\nFurther studies with a larger sample size are required to verify our findings.\nThe results of this study demonstrate the different mechanisms of the right and left frontal cortex in situations of social anxiety disorder.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c6c","authors":["Chiwa Kawashima","Yoshihiro Tanaka","Ayako Inoue","Mari Nakanishi","Kana Okamoto","Yoshihiro Maruyama","Harumi Oshita","Yoshinobu Ishitobi","Saeko Aizawa","Koji Masuda","Haruka Higuma","Masayuki Kanehisa","Taiga Ninomiya","Jotaro Akiyoshi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jad.2016.07.028","first_seen_on":"2016-07-30T21:38:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-2517","01650327"],"journal":"Journal of Affective Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1469924211,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=3&redirect=http:\/\/www.jad-journal.com\/article\/S0165-0327(15)31273-8\/fulltext?rss%3Dyes&code=jad-site","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0165032715312738"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jad-journal.com\/article\/S0165032715312738\/pdf","pmid":"27517133","pubdate":"2016-07-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Hyperfunction of left lateral prefrontal cortex and automatic thoughts in social anxiety disorder: a near-infrared spectroscopy study","type":"article","volume":"206","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hyperfunction-left-lateral-prefrontal-cortex-automatic-thoughts-social-anxiety-disorder-nearinfrared"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161363,"mean":6.8964925866473,"rank":6203905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1094401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161363,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257738,"mean":11.97337265507,"rank":182780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":40066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257738,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4274,"mean":6.1282064123567,"rank":3360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4274,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":8.9042,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
