In this investigation the focus was on the impact of osmotic (2M NaCl) and oxidative (5\u00a0mM H2O2) stress conditions during C. albicans biofilm formation. Oxidative stress enhanced extracellular DNA secretion into the biofilm matrix, increased the chitin level, and reduced virulence factors, namely phospholipase and proteinase activity, while osmotic stress mainly increased extracellular proteinase and decreased phospholipase activity. Fourier transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis of mannan isolated from the C. albicans biofilm cell wall revealed a decrease in mannan content and reduced \u03b2-linked mannose moieties under stress conditions. The results demonstrate that C. albicans adapts to oxidative and osmotic stress conditions by inducing biofilm formation with a rich exopolymeric matrix, modulating virulence factors as well as the cell wall composition for its survival in different host niches.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001226","authors":["Pemmaraju, Suma C","Padmapriya, Kumar","Pruthi, Parul A","Prasad, R","Pruthi, Vikas"],"doi":"10.1080\/08927014.2016.1212021","endpage":"909","first_seen_on":"2016-07-30T10:18:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1029-2454","0892-7014"],"issue":"8","journal":"Biofouling","last_mentioned_on":1471410644,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27472386?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27472386"],"pmid":"27472386","pubdate":"2016-07-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"897","subjects":["biology"],"title":"\n              Impact of oxidative and osmotic stresses on\n              Candida albicans\n              biofilm formation\n            ","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-oxidative-osmotic-stresses-candida-albicans-biofilm-formation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":6249342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1107648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258380,"mean":11.99735117018,"rank":182734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":41164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258380,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":322,"mean":2.3305109034268,"rank":181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":322,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.77692307692308,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
