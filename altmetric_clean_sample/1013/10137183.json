In this paper, a self-administered survey using a cross-sectional cluster-random sampling method in a sample of 5450 participants (2734 girls and 2716 boys) between 4th and 11th grades was conducted at six schools (two primary schools and four middle schools) located in Shantou, China. Self-reported peer victimization, bystander behaviors and information regarding parents' risky behaviors and individual behavioral factors were collected. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was applied to evaluate risk factors affecting peer victimization and bystander behaviors. The results indicated that urban participants were more likely to become bullying victims but less likely to become passive bystanders. Contrarily, bullying victimization was related to the increasing of passive bystander behaviors. Father drinking and mother smoking as independent factors were risk factors for peer victimization. Participants who were smoking or drinking had a tendency to be involved in both peer victimization and passive bystander behaviors. This study suggested that bystander behaviors, victims' and parents' educations play a more important role in peer victimization than previously thought.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f6100078a4","authors":["Huang, Zepeng","Liu, Zhenni","Liu, Xiangxiang","Lv, Laiwen","Zhang, Yan","Ou, Limin","Li, Liping","Zepeng Huang","Zhenni Liu","Xiangxiang Liu","Laiwen Lv","Yan Zhang","Limin Ou","Liping Li"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijerph13080759","first_seen_on":"2016-07-30T17:12:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1660-4601"],"issue":"8","journal":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1502277844,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27472354?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27472354?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27472354","pubdate":"2016-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"759","subjects":["publichealth","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Risk Factors Associated with Peer Victimization and Bystander Behaviors among Adolescent Students","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-factors-associated-peer-victimization-bystander-behaviors-among-adolescent-students-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8348788,"mean":7.0413328717018,"rank":7217862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8348788,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259907,"mean":11.987075735073,"rank":216546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259907,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3211,"mean":8.0074062305296,"rank":2776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3211,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173,"mean":5.2372093023256,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
