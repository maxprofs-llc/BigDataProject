However, proximate causes of senescence in general are disputed, and social insects often fail to meet the predictions of prevailing models. We present evidence for and against the long-held free radical theory of aging in social insects, and consider the application of the competing hyperfunction theory. Current results present problems for both theories, and a more complex picture of the biological processes involved emerges. The eusocial life style might allow colonies to allocate damage in ways that create seemingly senescence-free life histories. Only experimental approaches characterizing multiple senescence factors simultaneously will shed light on how social insects defy the conventions of senescence.","altmetric_jid":"537f30852a83eeb45a8b4599","authors":["Jane de Verges","Volker Nehring"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cois.2016.05.003","endpage":"75","first_seen_on":"2016-07-30T19:01:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["22145745","2214-5753"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Insect Science","last_mentioned_on":1469906827,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S221457451630061X?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/authors.elsevier.com\/a\/1T8V6_oMeKlBtj"],"pmid":"27720053","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"69","title":"A critical look at proximate causes of social insect senescence: damage accumulation or hyperfunction?","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S221457451630061X","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/critical-look-proximate-causes-social-insect-senescence-damage-accumulation-hyperfunction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8156965,"mean":6.8933631772734,"rank":3490770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4630790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8156965,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257714,"mean":11.971448223411,"rank":102203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":153546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257714,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248,"mean":4.2677732793522,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.1590909090909,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
