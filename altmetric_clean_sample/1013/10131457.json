Early this year, we reported high resolution cryo-EM structures of EF4 in complex with Escherichia coli 70S ribosome in pre- and post-translocational states with direct observations that EF4 disrupts the base pairs between the 3'-end of peptidyl-tRNA and the P-loop of rRNA in PTC. Here, we focus on the novel molecular mechanism how EF4 catalyses back-translocation, and discuss the common and specific energy barriers for forward- and back-translocation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f610008845","authors":["Song, Guangtao","Qin, Yan"],"doi":"10.1080\/15476286.2016.1215795","endpage":"00","first_seen_on":"2016-07-30T10:24:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1555-8584","1547-6286"],"journal":"RNA Biology","last_mentioned_on":1469874257,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27472653?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27472653","pubdate":"2016-07-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"00","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"EF4 reveals the energy barrier for tRNA back-translocation in the peptidyl transferase center","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ef4-reveals-energy-barrier-trna-backtranslocation-peptidyl-transferase-center"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8156965,"mean":6.8933631772734,"rank":7063349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8156965,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257713,"mean":11.971803354131,"rank":217748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257713,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":759,"mean":2.3153693931398,"rank":570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":759,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":2.5749743589744,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
