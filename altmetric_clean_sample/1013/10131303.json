The aim of this study was to characterize HLA-restricted T-cell responses from a severe HA subject with a persistent inhibitor and from two previously studied mild HA inhibitor subjects. MHCII tetramers corresponding to both of the severe HA subject's HLA-DRA-DRB1 alleles were loaded with peptides spanning FVIII-A2, C1 and C2 domains. Interestingly, only one epitope was identified, in peptide FVIII2194-2213, and it was identical to the HLA-DRA*01-DRB1*01:01-restricted epitope recognized by the mild HA subjects. Multiple T-cell clones and polyclonal lines having different avidities for the peptide-loaded tetramer were isolated from all subjects. Only high- and medium-avidity T cells proliferated and secreted cytokines when stimulated with FVIII2194-2213 T-cell receptor beta (TCRB) gene sequencing of 15 T-cell clones from the severe HA subject revealed that all high-avidity clones expressed the same TCRB gene. High-throughput immunosequencing of high-, medium- and low-avidity cells sorted from a severe HA polyclonal line revealed that 94% of the high-avidity cells expressed the same TCRB gene as the high-avidity clones. TCRB sequencing of clones and lines from the mild HA subjects also identified a limited TCRB gene repertoire. These results suggest a limited number of epitopes in FVIII drive inhibitor responses and that the T-cell repertoires of FVIII-responsive T cells can be quite narrow. The limited diversity of both epitopes and TCRB gene usage suggests that targeting of specific epitopes and\/or T-cell clones may be a promising approach to achieve tolerance to FVIII.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Ettinger, Ruth A","Paz, Pedro","James, Eddie A","Gunasekera, Devi","Aswad, Fred","Thompson, Arthur R","Matthews, Dana C","Pratt, Kathleen P","Ruth A.
