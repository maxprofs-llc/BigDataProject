How cells maintain these N-activity levels over time remains largely unknown. We address this question in the cell lineage that gives rise to the Drosophila mechanosensory organs. In this lineage a primary precursor cell undergoes a stereotyped sequence of oriented asymmetric cell divisions and transits through two different neural precursor states before acquiring a neuron identity. Using a combination of genetic and cell biology strategies, we show that Escargot and Scratch, two transcription factors belonging to the Snail superfamily, maintain an Noff neural commitment by blocking directly the transcription of N-gene targets. We propose that Snail factors act by displacing proneural transcription activators from DNA binding sites. As such, Snail factors maintain the Noff state in neural precursor cells by buffering any ectopic variation in the level of N-activity. Since Escargot and Scratch orthologs are present in other precursor cells, our findings are essential for the understanding of precursor cell fate acquisition in other systems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026e9","authors":["Ramat, Anne","Audibert, Agn\u00e8s","Louvet-Vall\u00e9e, Sophie","Simon, Fran\u00e7oise","Fichelson, Pierre","Gho, Michel","Anne Ramat","Agn\u00e8s Audibert","Sophie Louvet-Vall\u00e9e","Fran\u00e7oise Simon","Pierre Fichelson","Michel Gho"],"doi":"10.1242\/dev.134387","endpage":"3034","first_seen_on":"2016-07-30T10:09:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9129","0950-1991"],"issue":"16","journal":"Development (09501991)","last_mentioned_on":1473072187,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27471258?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dev.biologists.org\/content\/143\/16\/3024","http:\/\/dev.biologists.org\/content\/143\/16\/3024.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dev.biologists.org\/content\/develop\/143\/16\/3024.full.pdf","pmid":"27471258","pubdate":"2016-07-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press for The Company of Biologists Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"startpage":"dev.134387","subjects":["embryology","biology"],"title":"\n              Escargot and Scratch regulate neural commitment by antagonizing Notch-activity in\n              Drosophila\n              sensory organs\n            ","type":"article","volume":"143","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/escargot-scratch-regulate-neural-commitment-antagonizing-notch-activity-idrosophilai-sensory-organs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":1474608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6852501,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259802,"mean":11.981406976878,"rank":60821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":198774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259802,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4140,"mean":6.7377076588548,"rank":1378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4140,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":12.472096153846,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":5,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
