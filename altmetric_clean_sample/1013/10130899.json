The new species has females with body length of 250-330 \u00b5m and males 230-275 \u00b5m long, lip region set-off from body contour, 7-8 \u03bcm long stylet with small basal swellings, excretory pore located at 1.5-2.0 body diam. posterior to median bulb, post-vulval uterine sac short, 7-10 \u00b5m long and conical female posterior body end (tail) ending to a pointed tip. Males of the new species have seven (1+2+2+2) caudal papillae and a short mucro at tail tip. Based on morphological characters, the new species is close to C. cirrus, C. latus and C. leptocaudus. Phylogenetic analyses using the D2\/D3 fragment of 28S rDNA show the new species forming a clade with other Cryptaphelenchus species with maximal (1.00) Bayesian posterior probability (BPP) in Bayesian inference and 100% bootstrap value (BS) in the maximum likelihood method. The Cryptaphelenchus clade forms a monophyletic group with members of subfamily Ektaphelenchinae.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008daf","authors":["Esmaeili, Mehrab","Heydari, Ramin","Taheri, Zahra Majd","Fang, Yiwu","Li, Hongmei"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-30T10:08:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1175-5334"],"issue":"1","journal":"ZOOTAXA","last_mentioned_on":1469888469,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27470789?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27470789","pubdate":"2016-07-30T22:04:56+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Description of Cryptaphelenchus iranicus n. sp.
