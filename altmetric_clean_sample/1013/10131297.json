We show that its temperature dependence can be interpreted using entropic considerations based on the Kelvin formula and that it provides a meaningful probe of the crossover out of the Fermi liquid regime into an incoherent metal. This crossover proceeds in two stages: The entropy of spin degrees of freedom is released around room temperature, while orbital degrees of freedom remain quenched up to much higher temperatures. This is confirmed by a direct calculation of the corresponding susceptibilities and is a hallmark of \"Hund's metals.\" We also calculate the c-axis thermopower and predict that it exceeds substantially the in-plane one at high temperature, a peculiar behavior which originates from an interlayer \"hole-filtering\" mechanism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Mravlje, Jernej","Georges, Antoine"],"doi":"10.1103\/physrevlett.117.036401","first_seen_on":"2016-07-30T10:18:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1079-7114","0031-9007"],"issue":"3","journal":"Physical Review Letters","last_mentioned_on":1469873886,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27472124?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27472124","pubdate":"2016-07-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"\n              Thermopower and Entropy: Lessons from\n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Sr\n                    \n                    \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    \n                      RuO\n                    \n                    \n                      4\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            ","type":"article","volume":"117","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thermopower-entropy-lessons-sr2ruo4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8156965,"mean":6.8933631772734,"rank":4330547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2257885,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8156965,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257713,"mean":11.971828576084,"rank":141571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":90349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257713,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16295,"mean":11.047794034614,"rank":10296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":4882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16295,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":397,"mean":20.179484848485,"rank":237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":397,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
