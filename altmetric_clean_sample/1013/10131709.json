Outcomes included implementation of practices known to decrease maternal and\/or neonatal mortality and improve patient care.\nOverall, 25 and 17 births occurred in intervention and control clinics, respectively. Active management of the third stage of labor was appropriately performed by 20 (83%) of 24 intervention teams versus 7 (50%) of 14 control teams (P=0.015). Intervention teams implemented more practices to decrease neonatal mortality than did control teams (P<0.001). Intervention teams ensured patient privacy in 23 (92%) of 25 births versus 11 (65%) of 17 births for control teams (P=0.014). All 15 applicable intervention teams kept patients informed versus 6 (55%) of 11 control teams (P=0.001). Differences were also noted in teamwork; in particular, skill-based tools were used more often at intervention sites than control sites (P=0.012).\nUse of PRONTO enhanced non-emergency delivery care by increasing evidence-based practice, patient-centered care, and teamwork.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b55","authors":["Anna Walton","Edgar Kestler","Julia C.
