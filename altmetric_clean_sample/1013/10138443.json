One hundred and fifty-five SSCs were evaluated with regard to: age of patient at restoration placement, diagnoses, and duration of crown service. Duration service was further categorized as successful or failed.\nOf 155 SSCs, 137 were considered successfully functioning. Total failures were 18. The overall combined success rate for the study group was observed to be 88% with an average service period of 45.18 months. Significant success was noted in patients less than 9 years of age, and significant failure was observed in patients 12 years and older.\nStainless steel crowns are a viable option for interim restoration needs, with an 88% overall success rate during an average service period of 45.18 months.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100059ae","authors":["Discepolo, Keri","Sultan, Michael"],"doi":"10.1111\/ipd.12255","first_seen_on":"2016-07-30T20:08:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1365-263X"],"journal":"International Journal of Paediatric Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1469909280,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/ipd.12255"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ipd.12255\/pdf","pmid":"27474894","pubdate":"2016-07-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","pediatrics"],"title":"Investigation of adult stainless steel crown longevity as an interim restoration in pediatric patients","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/investigation-adult-stainless-steel-crown-longevity-interim-restoration-pediatric-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8156965,"mean":6.8933631772734,"rank":4330510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2257968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8156965,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257714,"mean":11.971445313197,"rank":141547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":90402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257714,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":356,"mean":2.9262929577465,"rank":208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":81,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":356,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.9722222222222,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":4},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BellevuePed\/statuses\/759480686298275840","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10138443],"posted_on":"2016-07-30T20:08:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Bellevue Dentistry","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_2_normal.png","id_on_source":"BellevuePed","tweeter_id":"2891378198","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":7},"tweet_id":"759480686298275840"}]}}
