In vitro antibacterial activity of 4-phenyl-1-(2-phenylallyl) pyridinium bromide was tested against Gram positive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Bacillus subtilis, and Gram negative Klebsiella aerogenes and Escherichia coli using disk diffusion method. Among them S. aureus showed strong antibacterial activity (21.99\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0mm) while E. coli showed very little activity (8.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\u00a0mm) towards the compound. The MIC of 4-phenyl-1-(2-phenyl-allyl)-pyridinium bromide for 90% S. aureus was \u226420\u00a0\u03bcg\/ml and was compared with phenoxymethylpenicillin, cloxacillin, erythromycin and vancomycin. When 4-phenyl-1-(2-phenyl-allyl)pyridinium bromide showed MIC at \u226420\u00a0\u03bcg\/ml, all others showed MIC at \u2264100\u00a0\u03bcg\/ml. Strong antibacterial activity of 4-phenyl-1-(2-phenyl-allyl)pyridinium bromide against S. aureus indicates that there is a possibility to use it as an effective antibacterial agent.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007753","authors":["Rasanthika Nayomi Jayatissa","Rohan Prasantha Perera","Chamari Madhu Hettiarachchi","Pathum Manjula Weerawarna"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12088-011-0234-y","endpage":"87","first_seen_on":"2012-03-13T17:31:12+00:00","issns":["0046-8991","0973-7715"],"issue":"1","journal":"Indian Journal of Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1331659827,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/x6x81u58v39g0272\/"],"pmid":"23450086","pubdate":"2011-09-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"83","title":"In Vitro Antibacterial Activity of 4-Phenyl-1-(2-phenyl-allyl)pyridinium bromide: A Novel Class of Pyridinium Based Antibacterial Compounds","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitro-antibacterial-activity-4phenyl12phenylallylpyridinium-bromide-novel-class-pyridinium-based-ant"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3084081,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":968397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76572,"mean":4.4088984602525,"rank":47263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":17320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76572,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":1.2168571428571,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"LK":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/TweetNTD\/status\/179620450857533440","citation_ids":[647161,647162],"posted_on":"2012-03-13T17:30:27+00:00","author":{"name":"Paul L.
