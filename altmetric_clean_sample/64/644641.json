However, the studies supporting this model used anesthetized animals or monomolecular odorants at limited concentration ranges. Using optical imaging and two-photon microscopy, we found that natural odorants at their native concentrations could elicit dense representations in the olfactory bulb. Both anesthesia and odorant concentration were found to modulate the representation density of natural odorants.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003167","authors":["Roberto Vincis","Olivier Gschwend","Khaleel Bhaukaurally","Jonathan Beroud","Alan Carleton"],"doi":"10.1038\/nn.3057","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2012-03-12T08:43:00+00:00","issns":["1097-6256","1546-1726"],"journal":"Nature Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1334932240,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/neuro\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/nn.3057.html"],"pmid":"22406552","pubdate":"2012-03-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Dense representation of natural odorants in the mouse olfactory bulb","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dense-representation-natural-odorants-mouse-olfactory-bulb"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":1929359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2536826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76538,"mean":4.4106248481126,"rank":24526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":51045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76538,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2882,"mean":19.872285317598,"rank":1948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":913,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2882,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":14.426888888889,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":52,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
