After 12 weeks, hyperactivity, as measured by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, improved 2.7 (\u00b1 4.8) points in the omega-3 group compared to 0.3 (\u00b1 7.2) points in the placebo group (p = 0.40; effect size = 0.38). Correlations were found between decreases in five fatty acid levels and decreases in hyperactivity, and the treatment was well tolerated. Although this pilot study did not find a statistically significant benefit from omega-3 fatty acids, the small sample size does not rule out small to moderate beneficial effects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cb4","authors":["Stephen Bent","Kiah Bertoglio","Paul Ashwood","Alan Bostrom","Robert L.
