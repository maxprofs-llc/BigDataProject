The immobilization of enzymes offers several improvements for enzyme applications because the storage and operational stabilities are frequently enhanced. Moreover, the reusability of immobilized enzymes represents a great advantage compared with free enzymes. In this work, we discuss the different methodologies of enzyme immobilization that have been reported for laccases, such as adsorption, entrapment, encapsulation, covalent binding and self-immobilization. The applications of laccase immobilized by the aforementioned methodologies are presented, paying special attention to recent approaches regarding environmental applications and electrobiochemistry.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023fc","authors":["Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez-Fern\u00e1ndez","M. \u00c1ngeles Sanrom\u00e1n","Diego Moldes","Fern\u00e1ndez-Fern\u00e1ndez M","Sanrom\u00e1n MA","Moldes D"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biotechadv.2012.02.013","endpage":"1825","first_seen_on":"2012-03-12T14:33:22+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["07349750","0734-9750"],"issue":"8","journal":"Biotechnology Advances","last_mentioned_on":1415184806,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S073497501200064X"],"pmid":"22398306","pubdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1808","title":"Recent developments and applications of immobilized laccase ","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recent-developments-applications-immobilized-laccase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":2940574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1424547,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76538,"mean":4.4084461632935,"rank":44103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":29491,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76538,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":370,"mean":2.078325203252,"rank":193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":370,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.3964615384615,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":12,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":43,"Student  > Doctoral Student":27,"Student  > Ph.
