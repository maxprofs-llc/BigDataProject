The virulent Toledo genome contains a 15-kb segment, which is present in all virulent strains but is absent from the AD169 genome. The pathogenic differences between the 2 strains are thought to be associated with this additional genome segment. Cytokines induced during viral infection play major roles in the regulation of the cellular interactions involving cells of the immune and inflammatory systems and consequently determine the pathogenic outcome of infection. The chemokine RANTES (Regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted) attracts immune cells during inflammation and the immune response, indicating a role for RANTES in viral pathogenesis. Here, we show that RANTES was downregulated in human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells at a later stage after infection with the Toledo strain but not after infection with the AD169 strain. miR-UL148D, the only miRNA predicted from the UL\/b' sequences of the Toledo genome, targeted the 3'-untranslated region of RANTES and induced degradation of RANTES mRNA during infection. While wild-type Toledo inhibited expression of RANTES in HFF cells, Toledo mutant virus in which miR-UL148D is specifically abrogated did not repress RANTES expression. Furthermore, miR-UL148D-mediated downregulation of RANTES was inhibited by treatment with a miR-UL148D-specific inhibitor designed to bind to the miR-UL148D sequence via an antisense mechanism, supporting the potential value of antisense agents as therapeutic tools directed against HCMV. Our findings identify a viral microRNA as a novel negative regulator of the chemokine RANTES and provide clues for understanding the pathogenesis of the clinical strains of HCMV.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334c","authors":["Youngkyun Kim","Sanghyun Lee","Sungchul Kim","Donghyun Kim","Jin-Hyun Ahn","Kwangseog Ahn"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.ppat.1002577","first_seen_on":"2012-03-09T06:35:54+00:00","issns":["1553-7374"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS Pathogens","last_mentioned_on":1331819416,"links":["http:\/\/www.plospathogens.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1002577;jsessionid=865375D01C37C43AE3EB76DF6F47190D","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22412377?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.plospathogens.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1002577?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+plospathogens\/NewArticles+(Ambra+-+Pathogens+New+Articles)"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.ppat.1002577.pdf","pmid":"22412377","pubdate":"2012-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e1002577","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Human Cytomegalovirus Clinical Strain-Specific microRNA miR-UL148D Targets the Human Chemokine RANTES during Infection","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-cytomegalovirus-clinical-strainspecific-microrna-mirul148d-targets-human-chemokine-rantes-duri"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":1786195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2638397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76665,"mean":4.4077128247939,"rank":21971,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":53030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76665,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3491,"mean":8.6857226361031,"rank":1957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3491,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":5.612608,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
