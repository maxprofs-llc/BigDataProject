It is characterized by anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries. Infertility is commonly present. A variety of methods has been used successfully to achieve pregnancy in women with PCOS. Maintenance of pregnancy is complicated by a higher rate of premature spontaneous abortions and high risk of gestational diabetes, hypertension, and preeclampsia. However, with careful monitoring and treatment, the outcome of pregnancy in most women with PCOS is excellent.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058be","authors":["Araki T","Elias R","Rosenwaks Z","Poretsky L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ecl.2011.08.003","first_seen_on":"2012-03-10T12:26:02+00:00","issns":["0889-8529"],"issue":"4","journal":"Endocrinology and metabolism clinics of North America (Print)","last_mentioned_on":1331381283,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22108285?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22108285","pubdate":"2011-11-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Achieving a successful pregnancy in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/achieving-successful-pregnancy-women-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631524,"mean":4.926174121992,"rank":2898542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80845,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631524,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73973,"mean":4.0542291407559,"rank":52934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73973,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":2.144352,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
