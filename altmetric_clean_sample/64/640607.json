Antibodies to T. gondii (MAT 1:25 or higher) were detected in 15.6% of red deer. Statistically significant differences were observed among sampling sites with seroprevalence in red deer from Catalonia (42.2%) being significantly higher compared with other Spanish regions (8.7%) (P < 0.05). Statistically significant differences were not observed between T. gondii seroprevalence and sex, age or management of hunting estates (open versus fenced). Seroprevalence of T.gondii infection in other ruminants species was 24% of 79 fallow deer (Dama dama), 21.8% of 33 in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), 33.3% of three Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica), 20% of 10 chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica), 10% of 10 barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia), and 14.8% of 27 mouflon (Ovis ammon) in areas not including Catalonia, where no samples from these species were available. Serological results indicated a widespread exposure to T. gondii among wildlife in Spain and suggest that consumption of raw or inadequately cooked meat, as well as handling carcasses of wild game, should be taken into account as a source of infection for humans.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fd","authors":["Gauss CB","Dubey JP","Vidal D","Cabez\u00f3n O","Ruiz-Fons F","Vicente J","Marco I","Lavin S","Gortazar C","Almer\u00eda S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vetpar.2005.11.013","first_seen_on":"2012-03-09T00:55:57+00:00","issns":["0304-4017"],"issue":"3-4","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1197417600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16359801","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.vetpar.2005.11.013"],"pmid":"16359801","pubdate":"2005-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Fisheries Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii antibodies in red deer (Cervus elaphus) and other wild ruminants from Spain.","type":"article","volume":"136","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-toxoplasma-gondii-antibodies-red-deer-cervus-elaphus-other-wild-ruminants-spain-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5168622,"mean":6.1023615749755,"rank":1285198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3284155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5168622,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79813,"mean":4.7484724352227,"rank":17542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":59362,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79813,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1391,"mean":1.8388230215827,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":981,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1391,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":1.118641509434,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
