Recently, evidence for a viral cause has been postulated, possibly cytomegalovirus (CMV). In one report, 80% of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme had detectable cytomegalovirus DNA in their peripheral blood, while sero-positive normal donors and other surgical patients did not exhibit detectable virus. However, another study reported that five glioblastoma patients showed no circulating CMV detected either with RT-PCR or blood culture.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a66","first_seen_on":"2012-03-12T06:39:05+00:00","issns":["1791-7530"],"journal":"Anticancer Research: International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1331534055,"links":["http:\/\/ar.iiarjournals.org\/content\/32\/3\/1113.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ar.iiarjournals.org\/content\/32\/3\/1113.full.pdf","pmid":"22399642","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"No Consistent Relationship of Glioblastoma Incidence and Cytomegalovirus Seropositivity in Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/consistent-relationship-glioblastoma-incidence-cytomegalovirus-seropositivity-whites-blacks-hispanic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2310238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1580754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76539,"mean":4.4369907235621,"rank":32468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":32701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76539,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1276,"mean":2.4496282352941,"rank":422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1276,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":0.63958333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
