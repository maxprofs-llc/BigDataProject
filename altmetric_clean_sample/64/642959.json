However, it is yet unclear whether different types of ED differ in their ER profile and whether certain ER difficulties are specific for ED or rather a transdiagnostic factor. Twenty women with anorexia nervosa (AN), 18 with bulimia nervosa (BN), 25 with binge eating disorder (BED), 15 with borderline personality disorder (BPD), 16 with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 42 female healthy controls (HC) were administered the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, the Inventory of Cognitive Affect Regulation Strategies, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale and the Affect Intensity Measure. The ED groups reported significantly higher levels of emotion intensity, lower acceptance of emotions, less emotional awareness and clarity, more self-reported ER problems as well as decreased use of functional and increased use of dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies when compared to HC. No significant differences between the ED groups emerged for most ER variables. However, there were indications that the BED group may show a slightly more adaptive pattern of ER than the two other ED groups. As a whole, all clinical groups performed very similar on most ER variables and reported more difficulties regulating their emotions than HC. The findings suggest that ER difficulties are not linked to a particular diagnostic category. Instead, ER difficulties appear to be a transdiagnostic risk and\/or maintenance factor rather than being disorder-specific.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d2","doi":"10.1016\/j.psychres.2011.11.009","first_seen_on":"2012-03-10T13:52:26+00:00","issns":["0165-1781"],"journal":"Psychiatry Research","last_mentioned_on":1348012800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22401969?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22401969"],"pmid":"22401969","pubdate":"2012-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Emotion regulation deficits in eating disorders: A marker of eating pathology or general psychopathology?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emotion-regulation-deficits-eating-disorders-marker-eating-pathology-general-psychopathology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8059414,"mean":6.8395785174396,"rank":3147141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4877908,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8059414,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93679,"mean":5.2357076367984,"rank":29022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":64279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93679,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3731,"mean":4.7108927613941,"rank":1187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":2526,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3731,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139,"mean":2.8055362318841,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":33,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Ph.
