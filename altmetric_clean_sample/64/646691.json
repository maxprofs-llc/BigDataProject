PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization are widely used palliative treatments for patients with nonsurgical hepatocellular carcinoma. TAE has been shown to increase levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) in tumors. In this study, we investigated whether RNA interference (RNAi) of HIF-1\u03b1 could improve the efficacy of TAE to treat HCC. Four treatment groups were assessed using a rat allograft model of HCC: RNAi of HIF-1\u03b1 combined with TAE, RNAi of HIF-1\u03b1 only, TAE only, and a control group. Rats were treated by TAE by retrograde placement of a microcatheter into the gastroduodenal artery. The results demonstrated that the RNAi of HIF-1\u03b1 visibly reduced the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and vascular endothelial growth factor, suppressed tumor angiogenesis, and attenuated metastasis, which were all enhanced by TAE. The RNAi of HIF-1\u03b1 synergized with TAE to significantly inhibit tumor growth. In conclusion, RNAi of HIF-1\u03b1 augmented the therapeutic effects of TAE and diminished its undesirable effects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c15","doi":"10.1007\/s13277-012-0349-8","first_seen_on":"2012-03-13T13:05:08+00:00","issns":["1423-0380"],"journal":"Tumor Biology","last_mentioned_on":1331643073,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22407533?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22407533","pubdate":"2012-03-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"RNA interference of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha improves the effects of transcatheter arterial embolization in rat liver tumors.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rna-interference-hypoxiainducible-factor1-alpha-improves-effects-transcatheter-arterial-embolization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":4205144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78977,"mean":4.705102410859,"rank":64804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78977,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1902,"mean":0.87306575486586,"rank":1062,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1902,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.8309090909091,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/VEGFRSSfeeds\/status\/179550181673549826","citation_ids":[646691],"posted_on":"2012-03-13T12:51:13+00:00","author":{"name":"VEGF RSS Feeds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516588600\/VEGF_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"VEGFRSSfeeds","tweeter_id":"88511740","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":363},"tweet_id":"179550181673549826"}]}}
