Recombinant mouse prolactin (r-mPRL), never obtained in its authentic form, can be very useful for research and tests in animal models, in which human prolactin (hPRL) is usually employed in a heterologous mode. Synthesis of r-mPRL was carried out here via secretion in Escherichia coli periplasmic space using a plasmid containing mPRL cDNA joined to the DsbA signal peptide sequence under the control of a constitutive major leftward promoter of the bacteriophage \u03bb (\u03bbPL). Fermentation in a pilot bioreactor was carried out at 30\u00b0C, with 6 H of induction at 37\u00b0C, reaching an optical density of 23 A\u2086\u2080\u2080 units, a specific yield of 0.06-0.1 \u00b5g mPRL\/(mL A\u2086\u2080\u2080), and a concentration of up to 2.2 \u00b5g\/mL. Even with such a low yield and a poor mass fraction, r-mPRL was purified via a three-step laboratory process based on hydrophobic chromatography, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). The purified hormone was then characterized using SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and HPSEC and showed, by Nb2 rat lymphoma cell proliferation assay, a bioactivity of 39.5 IU\/mg, determined against the International Standard of recombinant hPRL [World Health Organization (WHO)-97\/714].","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023fb","authors":["Suzuki, Miriam F.","Arthuso, Fernanda S.","Oliveira, Jo\u00e3o E.","Oliveira, N\u00e9lio A.
