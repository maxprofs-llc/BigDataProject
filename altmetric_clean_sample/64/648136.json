Regardless of the exact situation, macrophage activation and migration are intimately connected to extracellular matrix degradation. This process is accomplished by multiple proteolytic enzymes, including serine proteases and members of the matrix metalloproteinase family. In this study, we have utilized qPCR arrays to simultaneously analyze the temporal expression pattern of a range of genes involved in extracellular matrix metabolism in the mouse derived-macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 following stimulation with LPS. Our results revealed that LPS induces the expression of matrix metalloproteinases while at the same time decreased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors. The opposite scenario was found for the genes encoding serine proteases, which were downregulated while their inhibitors were upregulated. In addition, intergenic comparison of the expression levels of related proteases revealed large differences in their basal expression level. These data highlight the complexity of the gene expression regulation implicated in macrophage-dependent matrix degradation and furthermore emphasize the value of qPCR array techniques for the investigation of the complex regulation of the matrix degradome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000308f","authors":["Egerod, Kristoffer L."],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/157894","first_seen_on":"2012-03-14T09:59:01+00:00","issns":["0962-9351"],"journal":"Mediators of Inflammation","last_mentioned_on":1331751854,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/mi\/2012\/157894\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/mi\/2012\/157894.pdf","pmid":"22529519","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pathology","biochemistry"],"title":"LPS Counter Regulates RNA Expression of Extracellular Proteases and Their Inhibitors in Murine Macrophages","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lps-counter-regulates-rna-expression-extracellular-proteases-inhibitors-murine-macrophages"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2934754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1428375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76529,"mean":4.4305634016307,"rank":43999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":29578,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76529,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":659,"mean":1.6279240121581,"rank":303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":659,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
