Early prevention is important as overweight and obesity persist over time and are related with health problems later in adulthood. \"Komm mit in das gesunde Boot - Grundschule\" is a school-based program to promote a healthier lifestyle. Main goals of the intervention are to increase physical activity, decrease the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, and to decrease time spent sedentary by promoting active choices for healthy lifestyle. The program to date is distributed by 34 project delivery consultants in the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and is currently implemented in 427 primary schools. The efficacy of this large scale intervention is examined via the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d8","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2458-12-157","first_seen_on":"2012-03-08T18:54:33+00:00","issns":["1471-2458"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1342295541,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22394693?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22394693","pubdate":"2012-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Evaluation of a health promotion program in children: Study protocol and design of the cluster-randomized Baden-Wuerttemberg primary school study [DRKS-ID: DRKS00000494].","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-health-promotion-program-children-study-protocol-design-clusterrandomized-badenw%C3%BCrttember-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631524,"mean":4.926174121992,"rank":2898539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631524,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73888,"mean":4.0633132486093,"rank":52890,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73888,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4379,"mean":5.451467793513,"rank":3859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4379,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211,"mean":3.8650666666667,"rank":192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
