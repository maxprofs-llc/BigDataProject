The aim of the study is to find out whether these characteristics are consistently similar among isolates variations of MRSA. The study used 30 various isolates of MRSA belong to 13 spa types and 5 MLST types and determined the aggregation, the adherence, and the production of biofilms and slime for each isolate. The methods used to evaluate these characteristics were a modified Congo red agar assay (MCRA), a microtiter plate assay (MPA), high-magnification light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and PCR. The study found that isolates belonging to similar Spa, SCCmec, and ST types have similar abilities to produce biofilms; however, their ability to produce slime on CRA was found to be different. Moreover, isolates that have different Spa types showed high variation in their ability to produce biofilms. The results of light microscope revealed the isolates that produced strong and weak biofilms and formed similar aggregation on the glass surfaces. SEM results showed that all 30 MRSA isolates that were tested were 100% positive for biofilm formation, although to varying degrees. Further testing using PCR confirmed that 100% of the 30 isolates tested were positive for the presence of the icaADBC, fnbA, eno, ebps, clfA, and clfB genes. The prevalence of fib, cna, fnbB, and bbp in MRSA clones was 90, 93.33, 53.33, and 10%, respectively. This study indicate that differences in biofilm production capacities are caused by the differences in surface protein A (Spa) type and are not due to differences in MLST and SCCmec types.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd1","authors":["Pei Pei, Chong"],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/417247","first_seen_on":"2012-03-14T13:26:09+00:00","issns":["1110-7243"],"journal":"Journal of Biomedicine & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1331731035,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/jbb\/2012\/417247\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/jbb\/2012\/417247.pdf","pmid":"22529705","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biotechnology"],"title":"Comparative Characterisation of Genotypically Different Clones of MRSA in the Production of Biofilms","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-characterisation-genotypically-different-clones-mrsa-production-biofilms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628824,"mean":4.9380564480592,"rank":2901865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628824,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73757,"mean":4.0733382504474,"rank":53009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73757,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":325,"mean":3.443512345679,"rank":220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":325,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.86538461538462,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
