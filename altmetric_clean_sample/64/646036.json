FGF23 is produced by osteocytes in bone and acts on the kidney to inhibit 1alpha-hydroxylation of vitamin D and promote phosphorus excretion. Mouse genetics studies revealed that the osteoblast product, osteocalcin, acts on the pancreatic beta-cell to enhance insulin production and on peripheral tissues to increase glucose utilization as a result of increased insulin sensitivity and to reduce visceral fat. This review highlights the recent studies indicating bone's role as an endocrine organ.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ab","authors":["Seiji Fukumoto","T.
