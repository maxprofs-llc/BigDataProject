However, accumulating evidence has broadened this view, and their role in long-term energy homeostasis and the development of obesity has been increasingly recognised. In the present review, the recent research involving the role of satiation signals, especially ghrelin, cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide 1 and peptide YY, in the development and treatment of obesity will be discussed. Their activity, interactions and release profile vary constantly with changes in dietary and energy influences, intestinal luminal environment, body weight and metabolic status. Manipulation of gut peptides and nutrient sensors in the oral and postoral compartments through diet and\/or changes in gut microflora or using multi-hormone 'cocktail' therapy are among promising approaches aimed at reducing excess food consumption and body-weight gain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000579a","doi":"10.1017\/s0007114512000529","first_seen_on":"2012-03-13T17:14:58+00:00","issns":["1475-2662"],"issue":"-1","journal":"British Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1331658418,"links":["http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8511984"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/article_S0007114512000529","pmid":"22409929","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Current and emerging concepts on the role of peripheral signals in the control of food intake and development of obesity","type":"article","volume":"-1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/current-emerging-concepts-role-peripheral-signals-control-food-intake-development-obesity-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":3350317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1481288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79015,"mean":4.7009572227707,"rank":45723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":29832,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79015,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2555,"mean":8.8516851996868,"rank":1980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2555,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":4.9032903225806,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
