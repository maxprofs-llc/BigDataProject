The bioPhLoC monolithically integrates a filter with 3 \u03bcm high size-exclusion microchannels, capable of efficiently trapping cells in the incubation chamber, as well as optical elements for real-time interrogation of both chambers. The integrated optical elements made possible both absorption and dispersion measurements, which were comparable to those made in a commercially available cuvette. The size-exclusion filter also showed good and stable trapping capacity when using yeast cells of variable size (between 5 and 8 \u03bcm diameter). For cell culture applications, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), with sizes between 8 and 10 \u03bcm diameter, were used as a mammalian cell model. These cells were efficiently trapped in the incubation chamber, where they proliferated with a classical spindle-shaped morphology and a traditional hill-and-valley phenotype. During cell proliferation, pH changes in the culture medium due to cell metabolism were monitored in real time and with high precision in the monitoring chamber without interference of the measurement by cells and other (cell) debris.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ac","authors":["Xavier Munoz-Berbel","Rosal\u00c3\u00ada Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez-Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez","N\u00c3\u00baria Vigu\u00c3\u00a9s","Stefanie Demming","Jordi Mas","Stephanus B\u00c3\u00bcttgenbach","Sabeth Verpoorte","Pedro Ortiz","Andreu Llobera","Mu\u00f1oz-Berbel X","Rodr\u00edguez-Rodr\u00edguez R","Vigu\u00e9s N","Demming S","Mas J","B\u00fcttgenbach S","Verpoorte E","Ortiz P","Llobera A","Xavier Mu\u00f1oz-Berbel","Rosal\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez-Rodr\u00edguez","N\u00faria Vigu\u00e9s","Stephanus B\u00fcttgenbach","Elisabeth Verpoorte"],"doi":"10.1039\/c3lc50746g","first_seen_on":"2013-08-08T20:47:56+00:00","issns":["1473-0189","1473-0197"],"issue":"21","journal":"Lab on a Chip - Miniaturisation for Chemistry & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1375994794,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/LC\/C3LC50746G"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2013\/lc\/c3lc50746g","pmid":"24056720","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"4239","subjects":["chemistry","biotechnology"],"title":"Monolithically integrated biophotonic lab-on-a-chip for cell culture and simultaneous pH monitoring","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/xlink.rsc.org\/?DOI=c3lc50746g","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/monolithically-integrated-biophotonic-labonachip-cell-culture-simultaneous-ph-monitoring"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505915,"mean":5.1093654012801,"rank":2330910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1528146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505915,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90578,"mean":7.5608452476899,"rank":45672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":30104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90578,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1684,"mean":3.6295151515152,"rank":683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1684,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":4.66,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
