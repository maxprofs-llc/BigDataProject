We hypothesize that the SSG formats of 2 vs. 2, 3 vs. 3, and 4 vs. 4 players reveal game-like intensities and therefore are most adequate to increase game-specific aerobic fitness. Heart rate (HR), percentage of maximum heart rate (HRmax), blood lactate concentration (La), and time-motion characteristics of 17 elite male youth soccer players (aged 14.9 \u00b1 0.7 years, V[Combining Dot Above]O2max 61.4 \u00b1 4.5 ml\u00b7kg\u00b7min, HRmax 199.6 \u00b1 7.3 b\u00b7min) were collected by global positioning systems while performing the SSG formats. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and effect sizes were calculated to demonstrate the differences between SSG formats. Highest physiological responses were obtained in 2 vs. 2 (HR: 186 \u00b1 7 b\u00b7min, HRmax: 93.3 \u00b1 4.2%, La: 5.5 \u00b1 2.4 mmol\u00b7L) followed by 3 vs. 3 (HR: 184 \u00b1 8 b\u00b7min, HRmax: 91.5 \u00b1 3.3%, La: 4.3 \u00b1 1.7 mmol\u00b7L) and 4 vs. 4 (HR: 179 \u00b1 7 b\u00b7min, HRmax 89.7 \u00b1 3.4%, La: 4.4 \u00b1 1.9 mmol\u00b7L). Pronounced differences were found for most physiological parameters and for time spent in the speed zones \"walking\" (<5.3 km\u00b7h), \"moderate-speed running\" (10.3-13.9 km\u00b7h), and \"maximum sprinting\" (\u226526.8 km\u00b7h). The findings suggest that all the formats reveal game-like intensities and are suitable for aerobic fitness improvements. However, we found pronounced demands on the anaerobic energy supply in 2 vs. 2, whereas 3 vs. 3 and 4 vs. 4 remain predominantly on an aerobic level and differ mainly in the HR response. We suggest using 3 vs. 3 for soccer-specific aerobic fitness training.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040e2","authors":["Brandes M","Heitmann A","M\u00fcller L"],"doi":"10.1519\/jsc.0b013e318231ab99","first_seen_on":"2013-08-07T13:49:25+00:00","issns":["1064-8011"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research","last_mentioned_on":1375883315,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22126974"],"pmid":"22126974","pubdate":"2011-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Physical Responses of Different Small-Sided Game Formats in Elite Youth Soccer Players.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physical-responses-different-smallsided-game-formats-elite-youth-soccer-players"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628883,"mean":4.937418267118,"rank":2016395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":938418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628883,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85330,"mean":7.4657767699143,"rank":44331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":23036,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85330,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2385,"mean":14.256472315436,"rank":1937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2385,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":18.212261904762,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
