We describe a 60-year-old woman with history of bilateral hearing impairment and tinnitus who experienced both recognizable and non-recognizable songs. Curiously, she was able to reproduce non-recognizable songs in a way that could be recognized by others. This phenomenon is in line with current understanding that musical hallucinations represent abnormal activity in the auditory associative cortices, raising intriguing questions regarding memory, forgetting, and access to lost memories.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc9c","authors":["Danilo Vitorovic","Jos\u00e9 Biller"],"doi":"10.3389\/fneur.2013.00109","first_seen_on":"2013-08-08T08:55:38+00:00","issns":["1664-2295"],"journal":"Frontiers in Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1419784381,"links":["http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Neurology_Education\/10.3389\/fneur.2013.00109\/abstract?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/neurology_education\/10.3389\/fneur.2013.00109\/abstract","http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Neurology_Education\/10.3389\/fneur.2013.00109\/abstract","http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fneur.2013.00109\/full","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fneur.2013.00109\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/DownloadFile\/1\/3452\/59784\/1\/21\/fneur-04-00109_pdf","pmcid":"PMC3737457","pmid":"23964264","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Musical Hallucinations and Forgotten Tunes \u2013 Case Report and Brief Literature Review","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/musical-hallucinations-forgotten-tunescase-report-brief-literature-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":148.166,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":148.166},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8439927,"mean":7.0978907431096,"rank":53289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":8386766,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8439927,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129523,"mean":7.1001787958804,"rank":847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":128676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129523,"percentile":99},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1599,"mean":6.1400826032541,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":1591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1599,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":38,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":37,"Scientists":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
