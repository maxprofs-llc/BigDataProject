The stress-based model relies on the instantaneous shear stress in the blood flow, whereas the strain-based model uses an additional tensor equation to relate distortion of red blood cells to a shear stress measure. We use the newly proposed least-squares finite element method (LSFEM) to prevent negative concentration fields and show a stable and volume preserving LSFEM for the tensor equation. Application of both models to a simplified centrifugal blood pump at three different operating conditions shows that the stress-based model overestimates the rate of hemolysis. The strain-based model is found to deliver lower hemolysis rates because it incorporates a more detailed description of biophysical phenomena into the simulation process.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5283cf058f610003de1","authors":["Pauli, Lutz","Nam, Jaewook","Pasquali, Matteo","Behr, Marek"],"doi":"10.1002\/cnm.2576","endpage":"1160","first_seen_on":"2013-08-08T00:35:16+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"isbns":[],"issns":["2040-7947","2040-7939"],"issue":"10","journal":"International Journal for Numerical Methods in Biomedical Engineering","last_mentioned_on":1375922101,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cnm.2576\/abstract;jsessionid=750DA749A6EB63D37D1F2F22901A9E7C.d02t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cnm.2576\/pdf","pmid":"23922311","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1148","subjects":["biomedicalengineering","statisticsastopic"],"title":"Transient stress\u00e2\u0080\u0090based and strain\u00e2\u0080\u0090based hemolysis estimation in a simplified blood pump","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transient-stressbased-strainbased-hemolysis-estimation-simplified-blood-pump"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6413110,"mean":5.9879681948331,"rank":4741505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":949269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6413110,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102840,"mean":7.658384251111,"rank":69082,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":17494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102840,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":0.91058394160584,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.9083333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
