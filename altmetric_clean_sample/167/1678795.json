Building on research by Hirdes et al. (2011), we describe a resident profile in a representative sample of 30 urban nursing homes in the prairie provinces using Resident Assessment Instrument \u2013 Minimum Data Set 2.0 data from 5,196 resident assessments completed between 1 October 2007 and 31 December 2011. Residents were chiefly over age 85, female, and with an age-related dementia. We compared facility support and related services and resident characteristics by province, owner-operator model, and number of facility units. We observed differences in support and related services by both unit count and province. We also found that public facilities tend to care for residents with more demanding characteristics: notably cognitive impairment, aggressive behaviours, and incontinence. No clear trends associating the number of units in a facility with resident characteristics were observed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000dc7","authors":["Estabrooks CA","Poss JW","Squires JE","Teare GF","Morgan DG","Stewart N","Doupe MB","Cummings GG","Norton PG"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0714980813000287","first_seen_on":"2013-08-10T00:16:18+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["0714-9808"],"issue":"","journal":"Canadian Journal on Aging","last_mentioned_on":1422553849,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23920244?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23920244"],"pmid":"23920244","pubdate":"2013-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"A Profile of Residents in Prairie Nursing Homes.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/profile-residents-prairie-nursing-homes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7718514,"mean":6.6217058542162,"rank":3541040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4003172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7718514,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126805,"mean":6.8735398410147,"rank":48701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":74291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126805,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169,"mean":2.8994166666667,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
