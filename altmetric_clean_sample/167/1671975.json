The use of topical corticosteroids as local therapy for anterior uveitis is well-established, but periocular injections of corticosteroid can also be used to control mild or moderate intraocular inflammation. More recently, intraocular corticosteroids such as triamcinolone and steroid-loaded vitreal inserts and implants have been found to be effective, including in refractory cases. Additional benefits are noted when ocular inflammation is unilateral or asymmetric, when local therapy may preclude the need to increase the systemic medication.Implants in particular have gained prominence with evidence of efficacy including both dexamethasone and fluocinolone loaded devices. However, an appealing avenue of research lies in the development of non-corticosteroid drugs in order to avoid the side-effects that limit the appeal of injected corticosteroids. Several existing drugs are being assessed, including anti-VEGF compounds such as ranibizumab and bevacizumab, anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha antibodies such as infliximab, as well as older cytotoxic medications such as methotrexate and cyclosporine, with varying degrees of success. Intravitreal sirolimus is currently undergoing phase 3 trials in uveitis and other inflammatory pathways have also been proposed as suitable therapeutic targets. Furthermore, the advent of biotechnology is seeing advances in generation of new therapeutic molecules such as high affinity binding peptides or modified high affinity or bivalent single chain Fab fragments, offering higher specificity and possibility of topical delivery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007cf","authors":["Shenzhen Tempest-Roe","Lavnish Joshi","Andrew D Dick","Simon R Taylor","Tempest-Roe S","Joshi L","Dick AD","Taylor SR","Simon RJ Taylor"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2415-13-39","first_seen_on":"2013-08-06T10:25:17+00:00","funders":["bbsrc","dohuk"],"issns":["1471-2415",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1375784705,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2415\/13\/39\/abstract"],"pmid":"23914773","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMC Ophthalmology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"39","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Local therapies for inflammatory eye disease in translation: past, present and future","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcophthalmol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2415-13-39","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/local-therapies-inflammatory-eye-disease-translation-past-present-future"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7852123,"mean":6.6523326040983,"rank":6801031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7852123,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126984,"mean":6.8972047281921,"rank":103429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126984,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":507,"mean":2.1433122529644,"rank":343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":507,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.3681818181818,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
