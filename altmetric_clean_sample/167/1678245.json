Individual differences in children's ability to repeat novel nonwords are associated with vocabulary development and later literacy. Nonword repetition (NWR) is often used to test clinical populations. While phonological\/auditory memory contributions to learning and pronouncing nonwords have been extensively studied, much less is known about the contribution of children's oromotor skills to this process.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f2f","doi":"10.1044\/1092-4388(2013\/12-0206)","first_seen_on":"2013-08-09T16:50:39+00:00","funders":["mrc"],"issns":["1092-4388 ","1092-4388"],"journal":"Journal of Speech, Language & Hearing Research","last_mentioned_on":1376055924,"links":["http:\/\/jslhr.asha.org\/cgi\/content\/abstract\/1092-4388_2013_12-0206v1","http:\/\/jslhr.pubs.asha.org\/article.aspx?articleid=1802787"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jslhr.asha.org\/cgi\/rapidpdf\/1092-4388_2013_12-0206v1.pdf","pmid":"23926290","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"ASHA","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Linguistics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["audiology","speechlanguagepathology"],"title":"Articulating Novel Words: Children's Oromotor Skills Predict Nonword Repetition Abilities","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/articulating-novel-words-childrens-oromotor-skills-predict-nonword-repetition-abilities-saloni"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4932759,"mean":5.8535623969412,"rank":2125875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2739177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4932759,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94254,"mean":7.7393723701103,"rank":35543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":57208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94254,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":675,"mean":4.6917596439169,"rank":388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":675,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":6.6125,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
