Possible causal mechanisms for leukemias are environmental factors such as ionizing radiation from x rays and inherited susceptibility from polymorphisms in DNA repair genes. We performed a case-control study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia measuring reported postnatal x rays in 701 cases aged 0-14 y and in as many population-based controls matched on age and sex. In addition we performed a case-only study in 207 cases to evaluate the interaction between x ray exposure and polymorphisms in DNA repair genes. There was an increase in risk of leukemia with number of x rays: the adjusted odds ratio for two or more x rays vs. none was 1.48 (95% confidence interval: 1.11-1.97). That risk was slightly higher among girls (odds ratio = 1.67). A polymorphism in the APE gene (ex 5) involved in the base excision repair system was suggestive of an increased risk among boys and a reduced risk among girls. HMLH1 (ex 8), a mismatch repair gene, was associated with reduction of risk among girls. Results from the genetic data are still preliminary and must be interpreted with caution especially because of the relatively small number of genotyped cases. However, ionizing radiation from x rays as well as polymorphisms in DNA repair genes are plausible risk factors for childhood leukemia and should be studied more.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f6100065f3","authors":["Infante-Rivard,
