The hippocampal formation, an area of the brain strongly linked with learning and memory, is particularly vulnerable to the teratogenic effects of EtOH. Prenatal EtOH exposure can lead to long-lasting impairments in the ability to process spatial information, as well as produce long-lasting deficits in the ability of animals to exhibit long-term potentiation (LTP), a biological model of learning and memory processing. These deficits also have the ability to facilitate EtOH and\/or other drug abuse later in life. This study sought to determine prenatal EtOH exposure altered the effects of acute EtOH application on synaptic plasticity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021cc","authors":["Helfer, Jennifer L.","White, Emily R.","Christie, Brian R."],"doi":"10.1111\/acer.12227","endpage":"143","first_seen_on":"2013-08-08T15:43:31+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1530-0277","0145-6008"],"issue":"1","journal":"Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research","last_mentioned_on":1460834509,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/acer.12227\/abstract","http:\/\/www.readcube.com\/articles\/10.1111%2Facer.12227"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/acer.12227\/pdf","pmid":"23915337","pubdate":"2013-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"135","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Prenatal Ethanol (EtOH) Exposure Alters the Sensitivity of the Adult Dentate Gyrus to Acute EtOH Exposure","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prenatal-ethanol-etoh-exposure-alters-sensitivity-adult-dentate-gyrus-acute-etoh-exposure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.112,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.112},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7556298,"mean":6.524637537139,"rank":1166341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6389646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7556298,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125728,"mean":6.8455090314731,"rank":20563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":105129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125728,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1847,"mean":11.529378114843,"rank":462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":1385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1847,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":22.875238095238,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
