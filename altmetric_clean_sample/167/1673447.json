In this study, two molecular typing methods, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), were used to discriminate 23 Legionella pneumophila strains. The usefulness of MALDI-TOF-MS was demonstrated. The MALDI-TOF-MS fingerprinting with filtered small acid-soluble molecules gave different molecular profiles among strains, and the clustal analysis with MALDI-TOF-MS showed a high discrimination of strains the same as that with PFGE. In addition, MALDI-TOF-MS data could be generated within a few hours after the initial culture, although PFGE analyses took several days to complete. Thus, MALDI-TOF-MS offers a simple and rapid discrimination technique that could aid in the tracking of fast-spreading outbreaks of Legionella.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5043cf058f6100030c5","authors":["Fujinami Y","Kikkawa HS","Kurosaki Y","Sakurada K","Yoshino M","Yasuda J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.micres.2010.02.005","first_seen_on":"2013-08-06T23:56:00+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Microbiological Research","last_mentioned_on":1375833352,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20347283"],"pmid":"20347283","pubdate":"2010-03-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","microbiology"],"title":"Rapid discrimination of Legionella by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.","type":"article","volume":"166","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rapid-discrimination-legionella-matrixassisted-laser-desorption-ionization-timeofflight-mass-spectro-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3053994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":927740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90427,"mean":7.6291636255061,"rank":60475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":16896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90427,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153,"mean":1.46225,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.5548,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
