Sixty-four extracted human mandibular molars with curved mesial roots were instrumented with rotary files and divided into six experimental groups for final rinse: 1EDTA (syringe irrigation with 1\u2009mL of 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)\u2009), 5EDTA (syringe irrigation with 5\u2009mL of 17% EDTA), 1EDTA-P (syringe irrigation with 1\u2009mL of 17% EDTA\u2009+\u2009pumping with gutta-percha point), 5EDTA-P (syringe irrigation with 5\u2009mL of 17% EDTA\u2009+\u2009pumping with gutta-percha point), 1EDTA-EA (syringe irrigation with 1\u2009mL of 17% EDTA\u2009+\u2009EndoActivator) and 5EDTA-EA (syringe irrigation with 5\u2009mL of 17% EDTA\u2009+\u2009EndoActivator). Final rinsing was carried out over 3\u2009min. The specimens were split lengthwise and observed under a scanning electron microscope using a score criterion. Comparison among the groups showed statistically significant difference only between the 5EDTA-EA group and the other groups (Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's post-hoc tests, P\u2009<\u20090.05). The combination of 5\u2009mL of 17% EDTA and 3\u2009mL of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) with the EndoActivator removed smear layer from the apical area of curved root canals more effectively than the other protocols used.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f20","authors":["Yeung, William","Raldi, Denise Pontes","Cunha, Rodrigo Sanches","Mello, Isabel"],"doi":"10.1111\/aej.12038","endpage":"71","first_seen_on":"2013-08-06T10:44:48+00:00","issns":["1747-4477","1329-1947"],"issue":"2","journal":"Australian Endodontic Journal","last_mentioned_on":1375785813,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/aej.12038\/abstract;jsessionid=C299B52218EFB4F09C3074ECCF403357.d01t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/aej.12038\/pdf","pmid":"25244220","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"66","subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Assessment of smear layer removal protocols in curved root canals","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessment-smear-layer-removal-protocols-curved-root-canals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6330725,"mean":5.9768190153299,"rank":2978004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1893932,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6330725,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101946,"mean":7.6782142527834,"rank":50062,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":37637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101946,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.4666666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
