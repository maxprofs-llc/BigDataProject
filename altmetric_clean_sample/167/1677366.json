In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms of CLL cell death induced as a consequence of VSV infection in the presence of BCL-2 inhibitors, obatoclax, and ABT-737 in primary ex vivo CLL patient samples. Microarray analysis of primary CD19\u207a CD5\u207a CLL cells treated with obatoclax and VSV revealed changes in expression of genes regulating apoptosis, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and cellular metabolism. A combined therapeutic effect was observed for VSV and BCL-2 inhibitors in cells from untreated patients and from patients unresponsive to standard of care therapy. In addition, combination treatment induced several markers of autophagy--LC3-II accumulation, p62 degradation, and staining of autophagic vacuoles. Inhibition of early stage autophagy using 3-methyladenine (3-MA) led to increased apoptosis in CLL samples. Mechanistically, a combination of BCL-2 inhibitors and VSV disrupted inhibitory interactions of Beclin-1 with BCL-2 and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1), thus biasing cells toward autophagy. We propose a mechanism in which changes in cellular metabolism, coupled with pharmacologic disruption of the BCL-2-Beclin-1 interactions, facilitate induction of apoptosis and autophagy to mediate the cytolytic effect of VSV.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000311d","authors":["Samuel S","Beljanski V","Van Grevenynghe J","Richards S","Ben Yebdri F","He Z","Nichols C","Belgnaoui SM","Steel C","Goulet ML","Shamy A","Brown D","Abesada G","Haddad EK","Hiscott J"],"doi":"10.1038\/mt.2013.91","first_seen_on":"2013-08-08T14:44:58+00:00","funders":["cihr","nci"],"issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Molecular Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1375972864,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23689597"],"pmid":"23689597","pubdate":"2013-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"BCL-2 Inhibitors Sensitize Therapy-resistant Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Cells to VSV Oncolysis.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bcl2-inhibitors-sensitize-therapyresistant-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-cells-vsv-oncolysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3069984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":946531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90584,"mean":7.5862466025636,"rank":61464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":17762,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90584,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":874,"mean":5.4830240549828,"rank":682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":874,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":4.0162702702703,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
