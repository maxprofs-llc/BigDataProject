Ensuring accuracy and reproducibility of EML4-ALK testing by fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and next-generation sequencing requires reliable reference materials for monitoring assay sensitivity and specificity. Herein, we developed novel reference materials for various kinds of EML4-ALK testing. CRISPR\/Cas9 was used to edit various NSCLC cell lines containing EML4-ALK rearrangement variants 1, 2, and 3a\/b. After s.c. inoculation, the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from xenografts were prepared and tested for suitability as candidate reference materials by fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and next-generation sequencing. Sample validation and commutability assessments showed that all types of FFPE samples derived from xenograft tumors have typical histological structures, and EML4-ALK testing results were similar to the clinical ALK-positive NSCLC specimens. Among the four methods for EML4-ALK detection, the validation test showed 100% concordance. Furthermore, these novel FFPE reference materials showed good stability and homogeneity. Without limitations on variant types and production, our novel FFPE samples based on CRISPR\/Cas9 editing and xenografts are suitable as candidate reference materials for the validation, verification, internal quality control, and proficiency testing of EML4-ALK detection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d6d","authors":["Peng, Rongxue","Zhang, Rui","Lin, Guigao","Yang, Xin","Li,
