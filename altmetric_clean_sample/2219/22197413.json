A core-shell LC-MS\/MS multi-residue method for comprehensive quantitative analysis of the diastereoisomers of five SGARs as well as three first generation anticoagulant rodenticide molecules has been fully validated in liver of rats according to a bioanalytical guideline. A core-shell column (superficially porous particles) has been chosen for its ability to separate the diastereomers of bromadiolone, difenacoum, brodifacoum, flocoumafen and difethialone and for its robustness to rat liver extracts. The highly selective chromatographic separation of the diastereoisomers contributes to good signal to noise ratios and then enhances the sensitivity of the method compared to the ones of fully porous columns. An elution gradient has been optimized with 10mM ammonium acetate and acetonitrile as aqueous\/organic mobile phase respectively. Triple quadrupole mass detector has been used to achieve specifity and LLOQ from 0.92 to 2.2ng\/g for each diastereoisomer, or first generation anticoagulant rodenticides. Then we evidenced diastereoisomeric ratios in liver of rats issued from not controlled exposure of wild rats (Rattus norvegicus) trapped in a French Parisian park through a campaign of rodent eradication. We compared them to diastereoisomeric ratios in SGARs commercial baits that contain both isomers, and showed that one of the two diastereoiomers had nearly disappeared in liver of rats. The proportions of cis-bromadiolone and trans-difenacoum were really lowered compared to the baits: 5\/7 and 9\/12 rats had only trans-bromadiolone and cis-difenacoum hepatic residues respectively. Liver persistence of the two diastereoisomers of bromadiolone and difenacoum was different due to differences in their pharmacokinetics in wild rats. The new core-shell LC-MS\/MS method is particularly well adapted for further exploration of diastereoisomers ratios in rodent and predatory wildlife biological samples in order to evaluate ecological consequences of actual baits, to explore new formulated baits with a good balance between efficacity (ability to kill rodents) and diastereoisomers persistence, and hopefully to mitigate exposure of non-target species.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf7","authors":["Isabelle Fourel","Marl\u00e8ne Damin-Pernik","Etienne Benoit","Virginie Lattard"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jchromb.2016.12.028","first_seen_on":"2017-07-19T12:36:32+00:00","issns":["15700232"],"journal":"Journal of Chromatography B: Analytical Technologies in the Biomedical & Life Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1500467488,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jchromb.2016.12.028"],"pmid":"28033586","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering","chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Core-shell LC\u2013MS\/MS method for quantification of second generation anticoagulant rodenticides diastereoisomers in rat liver in relationship with exposure of wild rats","type":"article","volume":"1041-1042","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coreshell-lcmsms-method-quantification-second-generation-anticoagulant-rodenticides-diastereoisomers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8243836,"mean":6.9683207276644,"rank":1198089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6971942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8243836,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167261,"mean":11.678006528758,"rank":33043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":133295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167261,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1095,"mean":2.0930950639854,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":1051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1095,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":0.79591836734694,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Isabelle Fourel, Marl\u00e8ne Damin-Pernik, Etienne Benoit, Virginie Lattard.
