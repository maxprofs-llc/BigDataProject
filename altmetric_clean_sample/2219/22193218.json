Despite recent advances in melanoma research following the approval of several novel targeted and immuno-therapies, the majority of oncological patients will ultimately perish from the disease. Thus, new effective drugs are still required. Starfish steroid glycosides possess different biological activities, including antitumor activity. The current study focused on the determination of the in vitro inhibitory activity and the mechanism of action of cyclic steroid glycosides isolated from the starfish Echinaster luzonicus-luzonicoside A (LuzA) and luzonicoside D (LuzD)-in human melanoma RPMI-7951 and SK-Mel-28 cell lines. LuzA inhibited proliferation, the formation of colonies, and the migration of SK-Mel-28 cells significantly more than LuzD. Anti-cancer activity has been ascribed to cell cycle regulation and apoptosis induction. The molecular mechanism of action appears to be related to the regulation of the activity of cleaved caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), along with Survivin, Bcl-2, p21 and cyclin D1 level. Overall, our findings support a potential anti-cancer efficacy of luzonicosides A and D on human melanoma cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f61000668a","authors":["Olesya Malyarenko","Sergey Dyshlovoy","Alla Kicha","Natalia Ivanchina","Timofey Malyarenko","Bokemeyer Carsten","von Gunhild","Valentin Stonik","Svetlana Ermakova"],"doi":"10.3390\/md15070227","first_seen_on":"2017-07-19T08:50:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1660-3397"],"issue":"7","journal":"Marine Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1500454221,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/15\/7\/227"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/15\/7\/227\/pdf","pmid":"28718806","pubdate":"2017-07-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["biology","pharmacology"],"title":"The Inhibitory Activity of Luzonicosides from the Starfish Echinaster luzonicus against Human Melanoma Cells","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibitory-activity-luzonicosides-starfish-echinaster-luzonicus-against-human-melanoma-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8243836,"mean":6.9683207276644,"rank":6255957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1113145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8243836,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167244,"mean":11.679086849674,"rank":117698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":30914,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167244,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1055,"mean":3.5190284629981,"rank":743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1055,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":2.0928846153846,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
