ARG selection in fish tanks with multiple stresses of antibiotics and heavy metals"],"citation":{"abstract":"Abuse of antibiotics and heavy metals in aquaculture has been widely concerned and might aggravate the spread of resistance genes in environment. To investigate the occurrence and proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and heavy metal resistance genes (HMRGs), three commonly used antibiotics (tetracycline, sulfanilamide, cefotaxime) and two heavy metals (Zn and Cu) were designed to add individually or jointly in nine fish tanks including five individual exposure tanks of tetracycline (tet), sulfanilamide (sul), cefotaxime (cef), Cu, Zn and four combination exposure tanks of tetracycline\u00a0+\u00a0sulfanilamide (tet\u00a0+\u00a0sul), tetracycline\u00a0+\u00a0sulfanilamide\u00a0+\u00a0cefotaxime (tet\u00a0+\u00a0sul\u00a0+\u00a0cef), tetracycline\u00a0+\u00a0sulfanilamide\u00a0+\u00a0Cu (tet\u00a0+\u00a0sul\u00a0+\u00a0Cu), tetracycline\u00a0+\u00a0sulfanilamide\u00a0+\u00a0Zn (tet\u00a0+\u00a0sul\u00a0+\u00a0Zn) as well as the control during the experiment period of 180 days. Nineteen ARGs (tetA, tetB, tetC, tetD, tetE, tetG, tetM, tetO, tetQ, tetS, tetW, tetX, tetY, sul1, sul2, sul3, blaDHA, blaMOX, blaFOX), two HMRGs (copA, czcA) and the class 1 integron gene (intI 1) in fish tanks water were investigated. The results showed that the residual rate of antibiotics and heavy metals ranged from 0.03% to 2.46% and 9.25%-52.97%, respectively, positively related to their original concentration and types. Tetracycline resistance genes were more sensitive to antibiotics and easier to be induced and developed than sulfanilamide resistance genes and AmpC \u03b2-lactamase resistance genes. The total relative abundances of ARGs in combined stresses exposure tanks (tet\u00a0+\u00a0sul, tet\u00a0+\u00a0sul\u00a0+\u00a0cef, tet\u00a0+\u00a0sul\u00a0+\u00a0Cu, tet\u00a0+\u00a0sul\u00a0+\u00a0Zn) were about 1.01-1.55 times more than the sum of their individual ones. The co-selective effects of cefotaxime on the abundance and diversity of tetracycline resistance genes were stronger than Zn and Cu. Besides, multivariate correlation analysis revealed that tetO, tetQ, tetW and sul3 were in significant correlation with the concentrations of Cu and Zn (r\u00a0=\u00a00.882-0.992, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 or p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The significant correlations between tetO and intI1 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), tetW and intI1 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and sul3 and intI1 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) hinted a potentially serious and undesirable dissemination risk of ribosomal protection proteins gene of ARGs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003717","authors":["He, Xiaolin","Xu, Yanbin","Chen, Jinliang","Ling, Jiayin","Li, Yafei","Huang, Lu","Zhou, Xiao","Zheng, Li","Xie, Guangyan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.watres.2017.07.048","first_seen_on":"2017-07-19T12:16:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00431354","0043-1354","1879-2448"],"journal":"Water Research","last_mentioned_on":1500992409,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0043135417306218","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0043135417306218?utm_content=buffer4d7e0&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"28738272","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Evolution of corresponding resistance genes in the water of fish tanks with multiple stresses of antibiotics and heavy metals","type":"article","volume":"124","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evolution-corresponding-resistance-genes-water-fish-tanks-multiple-stresses-antibiotics-heavy-metals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":2.85,"6m":2.85,"3m":2.85,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272105,"mean":6.9807941447478,"rank":3250027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4986231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272105,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181333,"mean":11.744299197053,"rank":59972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":120152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181333,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3264,"mean":3.2038976402084,"rank":1405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":1844,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3264,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164,"mean":2.5581840490798,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
