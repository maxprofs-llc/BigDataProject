Whether this effect occurs in the context of the natural expression of emotions is unknown. To fill this gap, observers were asked to judge the gender of a natural face surrounded by a singleton color among five other face identities. In contrast to previous studies, the similarity between the task-relevant feature (color) and the distractor features was low. On some trials, the target was displayed concurrently with an irrelevant angry or happy face. The lateralized ERPs to these distractors were measured as a marker of spatial attention. Our results revealed that angry face distractors, but not happy face distractors, triggered a PD, which is a marker of distractor suppression. Subsequent to the PD, angry distractors elicited a larger N450 component, which is associated with conflict detection. We conclude that threatening expressions have a high attentional priority because of their emotional value, resulting in early suppression and late conflict detection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031ac","authors":["Nicolas Burra","S\u00e9lim Yahia Coll","Caroline Barras","Dirk Kerzel"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neulet.2016.11.055","first_seen_on":"2016-11-28T13:26:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03043940","1872-7972"],"journal":"Neuroscience Letters","last_mentioned_on":1480339598,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0304394016309181"],"pmid":"27899310","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Electrophysiological evidence for attentional capture by irrelevant angry facial expressions: naturalistic faces","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electrophysiological-evidence-attentional-capture-irrelevant-angry-facial-expressions-naturalistic-f"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7820779,"mean":6.6320512728979,"rank":6774257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7820779,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250436,"mean":12.197288302353,"rank":203029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250436,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3042,"mean":3.3854784610326,"rank":2453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3042,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":3.6034375,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
