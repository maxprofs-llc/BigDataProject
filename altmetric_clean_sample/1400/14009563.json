Eligible patients were randomly allocated to 2 study groups: cervicothoracic manipulation plus exercise therapy (n = 21) or home exercise program (n = 20). The outcomes measures included the visual analog scale (VAS); the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score; Shoulder Disability Questionnaire; subacromial impingement syndrome (Hawkins-Kennedy Test and Neer Test); and shoulder active range of motion (movements of flexion, extension, rotation, adduction, and abduction). Assessments were applied at baseline and 24 hours after completing 5 weeks of related interventions.\nAfter 5 weeks of treatment significant between-group differences were observed in the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score (P = .012); however, no statistically significant differences were achieved for Shoulder Disability Questionnaire (P = .061) and pain intensity (P = .859). Both groups improved with regard to disability and clinical tests for detecting subacromial impingement syndrome.\nThis clinical trial suggests that cervicothoracic manipulative treatment with mobilization plus exercise therapy may improve intensity of pain and range of motion compared with the home exercise group alone; the home exercise group had significant changes for flexion, extension, adduction, and abduction, but not for external and internal rotation movement in patients with shoulder impingement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a11","authors":["Sergio Vinuesa-Montoya","Mar\u00eda Encarnaci\u00f3n Aguilar-Ferr\u00e1ndiz","Guillermo A.
