We used a 3D reconstruction approach, based on electron microscopy, to visualize the spatial organization of granules in unstimulated and activated platelets. Two modes of exocytosis, single and compound exocytosis, were identified: a single mode which leads to release of the contents of individual granules and a compound mode which leads to the formation of granule-to-granule fusion, resulting in the formation of large multi-granular compartments. Both modes occur during the course of platelet secretion. Single fusion events are more visible at lower levels of stimulation and early time points, while large multi-granular compartments are present at higher agonist and at longer times. Whereas \u03b1 granules released their contents through both modes of exocytosis; \u03b4 granules underwent only single exocytosis. To define the underlying molecular mechanisms, we examined platelets from Vesicle Associated Membrane Protein (VAMP) 8 null mice. Following weak stimulation, compound exocytosis was abolished and single exocytosis decreased in VAMP8 null platelets. Higher concentrations of thrombin bypassed the VAMP8 requirement indicating that this isoform is a key but not required factor for single and\/or compound exocytosis. Concerning the biological relevance of our findings, compound exocytosis was observed in thrombi formed after severe laser injury of the vessel wall with thrombin generation. After superficial injury without thrombin generation, no multi-granular compartments were detected. Our studies suggest that platelets use both modes of membrane fusion to control the extent of agonist-induced exocytosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Anita Eckly","Jean-Yves Rinckel","Fabienne Proamer","Neslihan Ulas","Smita Joshi","Sidney W.
