Imjin virus (MJNV) was first isolated from the lung tissues of Ussuri white-toothed shrew (Crocidura lasiura) from South Korea in 2009. We aim to detect the species and prevalence of insectivore- and rodent-borne hantaviruses in shrews and rodents.\nShrews and rodents were captured in Jiaonan County of Shandong Province, China, in 2014. RT-PCR was used to amplify viral RNA of Hantavirus species, including insectivore-borne Imjin virus (MJNV), rodent-borne Hantaan virus (HTNV), and Seoul virus (SEOV) from shrews and rodents.\nWe found that MJNV infected 10.7% (19\/178) of Crocidura shrews, but it infected none of rodents (0\/475); we also found that 2 of 178 (1.1%) Crocidura shrews were PCR positive to SEOV. This study indicated that the major animal hosts of Imjin virus are shrews, and rodent-borne SEOV can infect shrews.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036f2","authors":["SunXi-Feng","ZhaoLi","ZhangZhen-Tang","LiuMiao-Miao","XueZai-Feng","WenHong-ling","MaDong-Qiang","HuangYu-ting","SunYue","ZhouChuan-min","LuoLi-Mei","LiuJian-Wei","LiWen-Qian","YuHao","YuXue-jie"],"doi":"10.1089\/vbz.2016.2056","first_seen_on":"2017-05-31T06:27:34+00:00","issns":["1530-3667","1557-7759"],"journal":"Vector Borne & Zoonotic Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1496217877,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/vbz.2016.2056"],"pmid":"28287930","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":" Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.  140 Huguenot Street, 3rd Floor New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA  ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["epidemiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"Detection of Imjin Virus and Seoul Virus in Crocidurine Shrews in Shandong Province, China","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detection-imjin-virus-seoul-virus-crocidurine-shrews-shandong-province-china"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":5998766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2001453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240196,"mean":12.039317745998,"rank":155274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":70866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240196,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":725,"mean":4.1358121546961,"rank":439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":725,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":4.5928571428571,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jeffoscoulos\/statuses\/869802460004720640","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20715088],"posted_on":"2017-05-31T06:27:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cosson","url":"https:\/\/www6.inra.fr\/bipar_eng\/VECTOTIQ\/Scope","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/667612877180792832\/24yLZAXr_normal.jpg","description":"Ecology of infectious diseases; interested  in wildlife-borne diseases, new molecular methods, science & society relationships, and @gr_pathobiome @ci_ticks","id_on_source":"jeffoscoulos","tweeter_id":"4232879555","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":798},"tweet_id":"869802460004720640"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DiagnosticChick\/statuses\/869826939338584064","license":"gnip","rt":["jeffoscoulos"],"citation_ids":[20715088],"posted_on":"2017-05-31T08:04:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Isabel Ott","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/800779584715124736\/xQlT-UZY_normal.jpg","description":"Bunyavirus enthusiast.
