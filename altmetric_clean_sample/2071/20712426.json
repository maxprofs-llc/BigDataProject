However, SSNMR experiments often suffer from low efficiency, due to the inherent low sensitivity and the long recycle delays needed to recover the magnetization. Here we demonstrate that the incorporation of a small amount of a Gd(3+)-chelated lipid, Gd(3+)-DMPE-DTPA, into proteoliposomes greatly shortens the spin-lattice relaxation time ((1)H-T 1) of lipid-reconstituted membrane proteins and accelerates the data collection. This effect has been evaluated on a 30\u00a0kDa, seven-transmembrane protein, Leptosphaeria rhodopsin. With the Gd(3+)-chelated lipid, we can perform 2D SSNMR experiments 3 times faster than by diamagnetic control. By combining this paramagnetic relaxation-assisted data collection with non-uniform sampling, the 3D experimental times are reduced eightfold with respect to traditional 3D experiments on diamagnetic samples. A comparison between the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) effects of Cu(2+)- and Gd(3+)-chelated lipids indicates the much higher relaxivity of the latter. Hence, a tenfold lower concentration is needed for Gd(3+)-chelated lipids to achieve comparable PRE effects to Cu(2+)-chelated lipids. In addition, Gd(3+)-chelated lipids neither alter the protein structures nor induce significant line-width broadening of the protein signals. This work is expected to be beneficial for structural and dynamic studies of large membrane proteins by SSNMR.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007b9d","authors":["Chang Liu","Jing Liu","Xiaojun Xu","ShengQi Xiang","Shenlin Wang"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10858-017-0120-y","first_seen_on":"2017-05-31T03:30:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0925-2738","1573-5001"],"journal":"Journal of Biomolecular NMR","last_mentioned_on":1496201384,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10858-017-0120-y"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10858-017-0120-y.pdf","pmid":"28560567","pubdate":"2017-05-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Gd3+-chelated lipid accelerates solid-state NMR spectroscopy of seven-transmembrane proteins","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gd3chelated-lipid-accelerates-solidstate-nmr-spectroscopy-seventransmembrane-proteins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":6294828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1122356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240195,"mean":12.039427820845,"rank":169334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240195,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316,"mean":1.9133333333333,"rank":216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.82,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
