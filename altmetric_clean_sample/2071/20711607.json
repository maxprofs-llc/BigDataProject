The study aims to identify the genetic variation of the parasite in AE patients from China.\nE. multilocularis isolates were collected from wild small mammals (n\u2009=\u20096) and AE patients (n\u2009=\u200956) from western China. Genomic DNA was extracted from different tissue samples including paraffin tissue blocks, ethanol fixed tissues and frozen tissues surgically removed. Two mitochondrial gene fragments (526\u00a0bp for cob and 474\u00a0bp for nad2) of E. multilocularis were amplified and sequenced.\nThe parasite fragment sequences of cob fragments from AE patients showed two haplotypes, and nad2 gene fragment sequences had four haplotypes. The gene sequences from Microtus sp. were 100% identical to the sequences of some isolates from AE patients. These haplotypes were distributed in both Qinghai and Xinjiang provinces. Alignment analysis with the sequences from the GenBank databases showed five genotypes including three Asian genotypes, one from Europe and one from North America.\nMost AE patients harbored the Asian genotype 1 which may be an indication of its relative frequency in the definitive hosts and the environment or of its pathogenicity to humans, which calls for further research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000883","authors":["Chuanchuan Wu","Wenbao Zhang","Bo Ran","Haining Fan","Hui Wang","Baoping Guo","Canlin Zhou","Yingmei Shao","Wei Zhang","Patrick Giraudoux","Jenny Knapp","Hao Wen","Ling Kuang","Jun Li","Chuanchuan Wu","Wenbao Zhang","Bo Ran","Haining Fan","Hui Wang","Baoping Guo","Canlin Zhou","Yingmei Shao","Wei Zhang","Patrick Giraudoux","Jenny Knapp","Hao Wen","Ling Kuang","Jun Li"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13071-017-2172-y","first_seen_on":"2017-05-31T02:39:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1756-3305"],"issue":"1","journal":"Parasites & Vectors","last_mentioned_on":1496198349,"links":["https:\/\/parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13071-017-2172-y?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13071-017-2172-y?site=parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28558809","pubdate":"2017-05-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"265","subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Genetic variation of mitochondrial genes among Echinococcus multilocularis isolates collected in western China","type":"article","volume":"10"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":7173917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240195,"mean":12.039435939282,"rank":195413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240195,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2301,"mean":3.7306426086957,"rank":1955,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2301,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146,"mean":4.4731724137931,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/bugbittentweets\/statuses\/869745030646317056","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20711607],"posted_on":"2017-05-31T02:39:09+00:00","author":{"name":"bugbitten","url":"http:\/\/parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/598482198031966208\/UgmFEdxp_normal.jpg","description":"Official Twitter account for open access @BioMedCentral journal Parasites & Vectors and its official blog BugBitten","id_on_source":"bugbittentweets","tweeter_id":"1735651082","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1584},"tweet_id":"869745030646317056"}]}}
