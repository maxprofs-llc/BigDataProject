In this context, large-scale studies emphasize the need for automated high-throughput systems providing a reproducible behavioral assessment of mutant mice with only a minimum level of manual intervention. Basic element of such systems is a robust tracking algorithm. However, common tracking algorithms are either limited by too specific model assumptions or have to be trained in an elaborate preprocessing step, which drastically limits their applicability for behavioral analysis.\nWe present an unsupervised learning procedure that is basically built as a two-stage process to track mice in an enclosed area using shape matching and deformable segmentation models. The system is validated by comparing the tracking results with previously manually labeled landmarks in three setups with different environment, contrast and lighting conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the system is able to automatically detect non-social and social behavior of interacting mice. The system demonstrates a high level of tracking accuracy and clearly outperforms the MiceProfiler, a recently proposed tracking software, which serves as benchmark for our experiments.\nThe proposed method shows promising potential to automate behavioral screening of mice and other animals. Therefore, it could substantially increase the experimental throughput in behavioral assessment automation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","authors":["Jakob Unger","Mike Mansour","Marcin Kopaczka","Nina Gronloh","Marc Spehr","Dorit Merhof","Jakob Unger","Mike Mansour","Marcin Kopaczka","Nina Gronloh","Marc Spehr","Dorit Merhof"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12859-017-1681-1","first_seen_on":"2017-05-31T06:42:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2105"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1496212942,"links":["https:\/\/bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12859-017-1681-1"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12859-017-1681-1?site=bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28545524","pubdate":"2017-05-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Algorithms","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computational Biology\/Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computer Appl. in Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"272","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"An unsupervised learning approach for tracking mice in an enclosed area","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unsupervised-learning-approach-tracking-mice-enclosed-area"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":6294832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1122358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240196,"mean":12.03935105227,"rank":169334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240196,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3623,"mean":5.0151662065157,"rank":3020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3623,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":6.2454318181818,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
