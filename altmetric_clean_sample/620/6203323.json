Resins specimens were prepared with 0-10% wt.% \u03b2-AgVO3 and characterized by SEM, XRD and optical microscopy. The antibiofim activity of the samples against Candida albicans and Streptococcus mutans was investigated by XTT reduction test, colony-forming units (CFUs), and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The flexural strength, hardness, and surface roughness of the samples containing \u03b2-AgVO3 were compared with the pure PMMA matrix.\nThe incorporation of 10% \u03b2-AgVO3 significantly reduced the metabolic activity of C. albicans and S. mutans (p<0.05). There was a reduction in microbial load (CFU\/mL) of microorganisms for the different concentrations used (p<0.05), which was confirmed by confocal microscopy. The addition of \u03b2-AgVO3 did not change the mechanical properties of hardness and surface roughness of the resins (p>0.05). However, flexural strength decreased with the addition of amounts greater than 1% (p<0.05).\n\u03b2-AgVO3 additions in dental acrylic resin may have an impact on inhibition of biofilm of main microorganisms associated with dental prostheses. However, the viability of clinical use should be evaluated in function of changed promoted in some mechanical properties.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000230a","authors":["Denise T.
