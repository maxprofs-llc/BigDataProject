The efficacy and safety of the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in this population is unknown. METHODS The charts of patients with INCPH undergoing TIPS in 7 centers between 2000 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed.\nForty-one patients were included. Indication for TIPS was recurrent variceal bleeding (n=25) and refractory ascites (n=16). Patients were categorised according to the presence (n=27) or absence (n=14) of significant extrahepatic comorbidities. Associated conditions were hematologic, prothrombotic, neoplastic, immune and exposure to toxins. During follow-up (mean 27\u2009\u00b1\u200929 months), variceal rebleeding occurred in 7\/25 (28%), including 3 with early thrombosis of the stent. Post-TIPS overt hepatic encephalopathy was present in 14 patients (34%). Eleven patients died, 5 due the liver disease or complications of the procedure and 6 because of the associated comorbidities. The procedure was complicated by hemoperitoneum in 4 patients (10%), which was fatal in 1 case. Serum creatinine (p=0.005), ascites as indication for TIPS (p=0.04) and the presence of significant comorbidities (p=0.01) at the time of the procedure were associated with death. Mortality was higher in the patients with significant comorbidities and creatinine\u2009\u2265\u2009100 \u00b5mol\/L (p\u2009<\u20090.001). CONCLUSIONS In patients with INCPH that have normal kidney function or that do not have severe extra-hepatic conditions, TIPS is an excellent option to treat severe complications of portal hypertension.
