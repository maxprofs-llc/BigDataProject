We conducted telephone interviews with cases and non-cases and collected administrative data on work hours.\nCompared to non-cases, CTS cases were more likely to report recurrent hand symptoms, decreased work productivity\/quality, decreased performance of physical work demands, and greater functional limitations. Surgical cases showed larger improvements on multiple outcomes than non-surgical cases. Minimal differences in paid work hours were seen between cases and non-cases in the years preceding and following CTS claims.\nPersistent symptoms and functional impairments were present several years after CTS diagnosis. Long-term functional limitations shown by this and other studies indicate the need for improved prevention and treatment. Am. J. Ind.
