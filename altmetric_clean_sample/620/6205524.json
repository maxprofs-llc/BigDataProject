Silver nanoparticles are recognized to demonstrate strong antiseptic and antimicrobial activity; thus, it also could be considered in the development of products for wound healing. Combining propolis and silver nanoparticles can result in improved characteristics of products designed for wound healing and care. The aim of this study was to formulate electrospun fast dissolving mats for wound dressing containing propolis ethanolic extract and silver nanoparticles. Produced electrospun nano\/microfiber mats were evaluated studying their structure, dissolution rate, release of propolis phenolic compounds and silver nanoparticles, and antimicrobial activity. Biopharmaceutical characterization of electrospun mats demonstrated fast release of propolis phenolic compounds and silver nanoparticles. Evaluation of antimicrobial activity on Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans strains confirmed the ability of electrospun mats to inhibit the growth of the tested microorganisms.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Adomavi\u010di\u016bt\u0117, Erika","Stanys, Sigitas","\u017dilius, Modestas","Ju\u0161kait\u0117, Vaida","Pavilonis, Alvydas","Briedis, Vitalis"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/4648287","endpage":"11","first_seen_on":"2016-03-17T13:35:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2314-6141","2314-6133"],"journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1458222545,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26981531?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26981531","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","title":"Formation and Biopharmaceutical Characterization of Electrospun PVP Mats with Propolis and Silver Nanoparticles for Fast Releasing Wound Dressing","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/formation-biopharmaceutical-characterization-electrospun-pvp-mats-propolis-silver-nanoparticles-fast"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7406294,"mean":6.4383957944913,"rank":3592683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3626558,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7406294,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":297163,"mean":10.677200173642,"rank":148514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":137418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":297163,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3974,"mean":2.7984304052353,"rank":1228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3974,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":1.8774757281553,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
