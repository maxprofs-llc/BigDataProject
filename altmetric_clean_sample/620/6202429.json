A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on the variables under study. Study subjects were considered to have nocturia if they answered \"once or more\" to the question: \"How many times do you typically wake up to urinate from sleeping at night until waking in the morning?\" Diabetic neuropathy was diagnosed if the patients showed two or more of the following three characteristics: neuropathic symptoms, the absence of the Achilles reflex, or abnormal vibration perception. Diabetic nephropathy was defined as positive when the estimated glomerular filtration rate was < 30 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2) and\/or the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was \u2265 34 mg\/mmol creatinine. Several ophthalmology specialists were responsible for evaluating diabetic retinopathy. Adjustment was made for sex, age, body mass index, duration of diabetes mellitus, current smoking, current drinking, hypertension, stroke, ischemic heart disease, and glycated hemoglobin.\nThe prevalence of nocturia was 80.4%. Diabetic retinopathy was independently positively associated with nocturia (adjusted OR of 2.39 [95% CI: 1.08-6.11]). In contrast, diabetic nephropathy or diabetic neuropathy was not associated with nocturia.\nIn Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, only diabetic retinopathy was independently positively associated with nocturia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036e4","authors":["Shinya Furukawa","Takenori Sakai","Tetsuji Niiya","Hiroaki Miyaoka","Teruki Miyake","Shin Yamamoto","Koutatsu Maruyama","Keiko Tanaka","Teruhisa Ueda","Hidenori Senba","Masamoto Torisu","Hisaka Minami","Morikazu Onji","Takeshi Tanigawa","Bunzo Matsuura","Yoichi Hiasa","Yoshihiro Miyake"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.urology.2016.03.017","endpage":"151","first_seen_on":"2016-03-17T01:17:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1527-9995","00904295"],"journal":"Urology","last_mentioned_on":1470579918,"links":["http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090-4295(16)00314-9\/abstract?rss=yes","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090-4295(16)00314-9\/fulltext&rc=0&code=url-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/retrieve\/pii\/S0090429516003149&rc=0&code=url-site","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.urology.2016.03.017"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090429516003149\/pdf","pmid":"26995392","pubdate":"2016-03-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"147","title":"Microvascular Complications and Prevalence of Nocturia in Japanese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: the Dogo Study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0090429516003149","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microvascular-complications-prevalence-nocturia-japanese-patients-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-dogo-stud-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8177609,"mean":6.9186386481167,"rank":3313903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4805841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8177609,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":303301,"mean":10.93076375206,"rank":110899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":189690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":303301,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3236,"mean":4.1525928902627,"rank":1268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":1948,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3236,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":205,"mean":3.0508823529412,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":205,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
