We investigated the estrogenic and androgenic effects of select pharmaceuticals with high production volume and environmental relevance. We examined the receptor-binding activities of these pharmaceuticals in the T47D human cell line using altered secretion of cytokine CXCL12. Functional yeast-luciferase reporter gene assays were also employed to confirm the mechanism of receptor binding by estrogen and androgen. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, namely ibuprofen, diclofenac and antiarrhythmic agent amiodarone showed strong anti-estrogenic effects in the T47D cell line. In the yeast-luciferase assay, these anti-inflammatory drugs also demonstrated anti-estrogenic potency and inhibited the E2 response in a concentration-dependent manner. Amiodarone did not exhibit any response in the yeast-luciferase assay; therefore, the endocrine disruption presumably occurred at a different level without directly involving the receptor. All the anti-inflammatory drugs considered in this study, including ketoprofen, naproxen and clofibrate, exhibited a dose-dependent antagonism towards the androgen receptor in the yeast-luciferase assays. Several other drugs, including the stimulant caffeine, did not show any response in the tests that were employed. A risk assessment analysis using 'Hazard Quotient' suggested a potential risk, especially in the cases of ibuprofen, ketoprofen, diclofenac and clofibrate. The results reveal the intrinsic endocrine disrupting nature of several pharmaceuticals and thus could contribute towards explaining a number of adverse health effects on humans and wildlife.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024f7","authors":["Ezechi\u00e1\u0161, Martin","Janochov\u00e1, Jana","Filipov\u00e1, Alena","K\u0159esinov\u00e1, Zdena","Cajthaml, Tom\u00e1\u0161"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chemosphere.2016.02.067","endpage":"291","first_seen_on":"2016-03-17T14:41:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1298","00456535"],"journal":"Chemosphere","last_mentioned_on":1458854737,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0045653516302156","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0045653516302156?via%3Dihub"],"pmid":"26978704","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"284","subjects":["chemistry","biology","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Widely used pharmaceuticals present in the environment revealed as in\u00a0vitro antagonists for human estrogen and androgen receptors","type":"article","volume":"152","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/widely-used-pharmaceuticals-present-environment-revealed-vitro-antagonists-human-estrogen-androgen-r"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7435912,"mean":6.4641587488024,"rank":3610872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3637440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7435912,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":297448,"mean":10.697094473973,"rank":148884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":137417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":297448,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3186,"mean":3.2667277864992,"rank":2108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3186,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":1.4977974683544,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
