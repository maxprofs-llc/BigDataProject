The safranin staining assay, isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC), and SEM were applied before and after surface cleaning.\nThe hydrophilic surfaces modMA and modSLA with greater surface micro-roughness exhibited significantly more biofilm than the hydrophobic surfaces TAV MG and M. The standardized cleaning procedure substantially reduced the biofilm mass on all surfaces. After cleaning, the IMC analyses demonstrated a longer lag time of the growth curve on TAV MG compared to modSLA. Inter- and intraindividual variations in biofilm formation on the titanium discs were evident throughout the study.\nSurface hydrophilicity and roughness enhanced biofilm formation in\u00a0vivo, whereas surface topography was the most influential factor that determined surface cleanability. While the grooved surface retained larger amounts of initial biofilm, the machined surface was easier to clean, but proliferation indicated by increased metabolic activity (growth rate) in IMC occurred despite mechanical biofilm removal.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000256b","authors":["Zaugg, Lucia K.","Astasov\u2010Frauenhoffer, Monika","Braissant, Olivier","Hauser\u2010Gerspach, Irmgard","Waltimo, Tuomas","Zitzmann, Nicola U.","Zaugg, Lucia K","Astasov-Frauenhoffer, Monika","Hauser-Gerspach, Irmgard","Zitzmann, Nicola U"],"doi":"10.1111\/clr.12821","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-03-17T06:53:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1600-0501"],"journal":"Clinical Oral Implants Research","last_mentioned_on":1458713724,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/clr.12821","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26992098?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26992098?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/clr.12821\/pdf","pmid":"26992098","pubdate":"2016-03-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Determinants of biofilm formation and cleanability of titanium surfaces","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/determinants-biofilm-formation-cleanability-titanium-surfaces"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7430207,"mean":6.4614621922959,"rank":3607550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3635229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7430207,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":297410,"mean":10.695872680383,"rank":148825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":137406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":297410,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":662,"mean":1.9681149773071,"rank":261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":662,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":0.61775862068966,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
