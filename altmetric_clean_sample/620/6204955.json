Here, we demonstrate that human enzyme, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) is a new class of host factor that inhibits influenza A virus (IAV) infection, and IAV dysregulates HDAC1 to efficiently replicate in epithelial cells. A time-dependent decrease in HDAC1 polypeptide level was observed in IAV-infected cells, reducing to less than 50% by 24 h of infection. A further depletion (97%) of HDAC1 expression by RNA interference increased the IAV growth kinetics, increasing it by more than 3-fold by 24 h and 6-fold by 48 h of infection. Conversely, overexpression of HDAC1 decreased the IAV infection by more than 2-fold. Likewise, a time-dependent decrease in HDAC1 deacetylase activity, albeit with a slightly different kinetics to HDAC1 polypeptide reduction, was observed in infected cells. Nevertheless, a further inhibition of deacetylase activity increased IAV infection in a dose-dependent manner. HDAC1 is an important host deacetylase and in addition to its role as a transcription repressor, HDAC1 has been lately described as a co-activator of type I interferon response. Consistent with this property, we found that inhibition of deacetylase activity either decreased or abolished the phosphorylation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription I (STAT1) and expression of interferon-stimulated genes, IFITM3, ISG15, and viperin in IAV-infected cells. Furthermore, the knockdown of HDAC1 expression in infected cells decreased viperin expression by 58%, and conversely, the overexpression of HDAC1 increased it by 55%, indicating that HDAC1 is a component of IAV-induced host type I interferon antiviral response.\nInfluenza A virus (IAV) continues to significantly impact global public health by causing regular seasonal epidemics, occasional pandemics, and zoonotic outbreaks. IAV is among the successful human viral pathogens that has evolved various strategies to evade host defences, prevented the development of a universal vaccine, and acquired antiviral drug resistance. A comprehensive knowledge of IAV-host interactions is needed to develop a novel and alternative anti-IAV strategy. Host produces a variety of factors that are able to fight IAV infection by employing various mechanisms. However, the full repertoire of anti-IAV host factors and their antiviral mechanisms are yet to be identified. We have identified here a new host factor, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) that inhibits IAV infection. We demonstrate that HDAC1 is a component of host innate antiviral response against IAV, and IAV undermines HDAC1 to limit its role in antiviral response.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Prashanth Thevkar Nagesh","Matloob Husain"],"doi":"10.1128\/jvi.00126-16","first_seen_on":"2016-03-17T12:09:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-5514"],"journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1458216542,"links":["http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/early\/2016\/02\/18\/JVI.00126-16.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/early\/2016\/02\/18\/JVI.00126-16.full.pdf","pmid":"26912629","pubdate":"2016-02-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"JVI.00126-16","title":"Influenza A virus dysregulates host histone deacetylase 1 that inhibits viral infection in lung epithelial cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influenza-virus-dysregulates-host-histone-deacetylase-1-inhibits-viral-infection-lung-epithelial-cel"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7406294,"mean":6.4383957944913,"rank":5603204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":996294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7406294,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":297162,"mean":10.677198077809,"rank":208571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":46560,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":297162,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6308,"mean":4.149820833994,"rank":4846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6308,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254,"mean":4.9172806324111,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
