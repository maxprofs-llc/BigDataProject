It also describes the method used for testing the efficacy of the formulated fungi as biocontrol agents of targeted insects. Detailed examples demonstrating the efficacy of formulated strains of entomopathogenic fungi against certain species of insect pests were included in the present article. The techniques and methods described in this article are reproducible and helpful in enhancing the effectiveness of formulated fungi against wide range of targeted insects in comparison with the unformulated form of these fungi. Also, these techniques and methods can be used effectively in crop protection and in the integrated pest management programs. Finally, it is important to indicate that the ingredients used for preparation of the invert emulsion have no environmental side-effects or health risks since these ingredients are safe to use and can be used in manufacturing of cosmetics or as food additives.\u2022Description of method used for preparation of invert emulsion (water-in-oil type) and selecting the most stable and non-viscous emulsion.\u2022Description of technique used for introducing the entomopathogenic fungi into the selected stable and non-viscous invert emulsion.\u2022Description of method for testing the efficacy of introduced entomopathogenic fungus into the selected invert emulsion against targeted insects with detailed examples on the efficacy testing.","altmetric_jid":"53035e4e3cf05868408b4567","authors":["Batta, Yacoub A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mex.2016.02.001","endpage":"127","first_seen_on":"2016-03-17T13:05:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2215-0161","22150161"],"journal":"MethodsX","last_mentioned_on":1458219888,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26981435?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26981435","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"119","title":"Invert emulsion: Method of preparation and application as proper formulation of entomopathogenic fungi","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/invert-emulsion-method-preparation-application-proper-formulation-entomopathogenic-fungi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7406294,"mean":6.4383957944913,"rank":6410177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7406294,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":297163,"mean":10.677184020837,"rank":250627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":297163,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":3.3999591836735,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.4875,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
