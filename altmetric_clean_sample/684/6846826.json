Inorganic compounds of aluminum, arsenic, lead, lithium, manganese, mercury, and thallium are well known for their neurological and behavioral effects in humans. The alkyl derivatives of certain metals--lead, mercury and tin--are specially neurotoxic. Concern over human exposure and in some cases, outbreaks of poisoning, have stimulated research into the toxic action of these metals. A number of interesting hypotheses have been proposed for the mechanism of lead toxicity on the nervous system. Lead is known to be a potent inhibitor of heme synthesis. A reduction in heme-containing enzymes could compromise energy metabolism. Lead may affect brain function by interference with neurotransmitters such as gamma-amino-isobutyric acid. There is mounting evidence that lead interferes with membrane transport and binding of calcium ions. Methylmercury produces focal damage to specific areas in the adult brain. One hypothesis proposes that certain cells are susceptible because they cannot repair the initial damage to the protein sythesis machinery. The developing nervous system is especially susceptible to damage by methylmercury. It has been discovered that microtubules are destroyed by this form of mercury and this effect may explain the inhibition of cell division and cell migration, processes that occur only in the developmental stages. These and other hypotheses will stimulate considerable experimental challenges in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027e9","authors":["T W Clarkson"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-21T06:17:06+00:00","issns":["0091-6765"],"journal":"Environmental Health Perspectives","last_mentioned_on":1500345535,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1474439\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1474439\/?page=2","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1474439\/"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1474439\/pdf\/envhper00434-0058.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1474439","pmid":"3319566","pubdate":"1987-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Institute of Environmental Health Science","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"59","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Metal toxicity in the central nervous system.","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metal-toxicity-central-nervous-system"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.25,"score_history":{"1y":7.25,"6m":7.25,"3m":7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":815562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7406404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271916,"mean":11.471724046117,"rank":39060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":232349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271916,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5888,"mean":10.0531907593,"rank":869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":5006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5888,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":64.888652173913,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
