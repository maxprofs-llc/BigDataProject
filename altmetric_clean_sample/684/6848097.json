Females reached a larger total length (LT ) and total body mass (MT ) (298\u2009mm and 148\u2009g) than males (250\u2009mm and 90\u2009g). Length at maturity was estimated to be 188 and 199\u2009mm LT for males and females. Uterine fecundity ranged from one to four embryos (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.: 1\u00b785\u2009\u00b1\u20090\u00b745). Size at birth was estimated to be 105\u2009mm LT . Gestation lasted between 4 and 5\u2009months. The reproductive cycle of U. microphthalmum is hypothesized to be asynchronous and biannual.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002da9","authors":["Santander\u2010Neto, J.","Ara\u00fajo, M. L.
