PM","MIDOSTAURIN an emerging treatment for acute myeloid leukemia patients Authors: Gallogly MM, Lazarus HM"],"citation":{"abstract":"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy that carries a poor prognosis and has garnered few treatment advances in the last few decades. Mutation of the internal tandem duplication (ITD) region of fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) is considered high risk for decreased response and overall survival. Midostaurin is a Type III receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor found to inhibit FLT3 and other receptor tyrosine kinases, including platelet-derived growth factor receptors, cyclin-dependent kinase 1, src, c-kit, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. In preclinical studies, midostaurin exhibited broad-spectrum antitumor activity toward a wide range of tumor xenografts, as well as an FLT3-ITD-driven mouse model of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Midostaurin is orally administered and generally well tolerated as a single agent; hematologic toxicity increases substantially when administered in combination with standard induction chemotherapy. Clinical trials primarily have focused on relapsed\/refractory AML and MDS and included single- and combination-agent studies. Administration of midostaurin to relapsed\/refractory MDS and AML patients confers a robust anti-blast response sufficient to bridge a minority of patients to transplant. In combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors, responses appear comparable to historic controls, while the addition of midostaurin to standard induction chemotherapy may prolong survival in FLT3-ITD mutant patients. The response of some wild-type (WT)-FLT3 patients to midostaurin therapy is consistent with midostaurin's ability to inhibit WT-FLT3 in vitro, and also may reflect overexpression of WT-FLT3 in those patients and\/or off-target effects such as inhibition of kinases other than FLT3. Midostaurin represents a well-tolerated, easily administered oral agent with the potential to bridge mutant and WT-FLT3 AML patients to transplant and possibly deepen response to induction chemotherapy. Ongoing studies are investigating midostaurin's role in pretransplant induction and posttransplant consolidation therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc39","authors":["Hillard Lazarus","Molly Miller","Gallogly, Molly Megan","Lazarus, Hillard M"],"doi":"10.2147\/jbm.s100283","first_seen_on":"2016-04-21T05:02:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1179-2736"],"journal":"Journal of Blood Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1463602856,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=26510","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27186148?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=29951","pmcid":"PMC4848023","pmid":"27186148","pubdate":"2016-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"73","title":"Midostaurin: an emerging treatment for acute myeloid leukemia patients","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/midostaurin-emerging-treatment-acute-myeloid-leukemia-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7715105,"mean":6.6184650148513,"rank":5557421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1881400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7715105,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268407,"mean":11.310238943987,"rank":171994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":80706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268407,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":2.1558554216867,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":4.986,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/professororg\/statuses\/723014048531369985","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6846177],"posted_on":"2016-04-21T05:02:36+00:00","author":{"name":"DrOmprakash Nautiyal","url":"http:\/\/www.opnautiyal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3097730175\/666d9fca2ae83078ead9440b7a2fcbc3_normal.jpeg","description":"I am Professor of Organic chemistry. 5 patents, 9 intl. confs. and 32 res pub, 2 Books and 7 chapters  to credit.
