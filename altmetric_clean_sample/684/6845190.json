Disagreements about treatment protocols, treatment aims and poor communication are recognised warning signs. Conflict management strategies can be used to prevent escalation, but are not a routine component of clinical training.\nTo report the findings from a novel training intervention, aimed at enabling paediatric staff to identify and understand the warning signs of conflict, and to implement conflict resolution strategies.\nSelf-report measures were taken at baseline, immediately after the training and at 6\u2005months. Questionnaires recorded quantitative and qualitative feedback on the experience of training, and the ability to recognise and de-escalate conflict. The training was provided in a tertiary teaching paediatric hospital in England over 18\u2005months, commencing in June 2013.\nA 4-h training course on identifying, understanding and managing conflict was provided to staff.\nBaseline data were collected from all 711 staff trained, and 6-month follow-up data were collected for 313 of those staff (44%). The training was successful in equipping staff to recognise and de-escalate conflict. Six months after the training, 57% of respondents had experienced conflict, of whom 91% reported that the training had enabled them to de-escalate the conflict. Learning was retained at 6 months with staff more able than at baseline recognising conflict triggers (Fischer's exact test, p=0.001) and managing conflict situations (Pearson's \u03c7(2) test, p=0.001).\nThis training has the potential to reduce substantially the human and economic costs of conflicts for healthcare providers, healthcare staff, patients and relatives.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002302","authors":["Liz Forbat","Jean Simons","Charlotte Sayer","Megan Davies","Sarah Barclay"],"doi":"10.1136\/archdischild-2016-310737","first_seen_on":"2016-04-21T02:39:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["14682044","1468-2044","0003-9888"],"issue":"3","journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","last_mentioned_on":1501765571,"links":["http:\/\/adc.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/20\/archdischild-2016-310737.short?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/adc.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/20\/archdischild-2016-310737.abstract","http:\/\/adc.bmj.com\/content\/102\/3\/250?rss=1","http:\/\/adc.bmj.com\/content\/102\/3\/250.full?ijkey=xPYCLOk6vk7VeEd&keytype=ref","http:\/\/adc.bmj.com\/content\/102\/3\/250"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/adc.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/20\/archdischild-2016-310737.full.pdf","pmid":"27098546","pubdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"archdischild-2016-310737","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Training paediatric healthcare staff in recognising, understanding and managing conflict with patients and families: findings from a survey on immediate and 6-month impact","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/adc.bmj.com\/lookup\/doi\/10.1136\/archdischild-2016-310737","volume":"102","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/training-paediatric-healthcare-staff-recognising-understanding-managing-conflict-patients-families-f"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.8,"score_history":{"1y":6.3,"6m":3.7,"3m":3.2,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":1137061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":7177980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272608,"mean":11.483470681237,"rank":51623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":220850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272608,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3955,"mean":7.3832013151239,"rank":703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3955,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":14.21395,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":89,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
