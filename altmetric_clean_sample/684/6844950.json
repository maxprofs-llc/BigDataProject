The signal intensity ratios (SIRs) of muscles and brain white matter were calculated.\nThe mean SIRs before treatment were 2.28\u00b10.74 in SR, 2.66\u00b10.57 in IR, 2.03\u00b10.42 in LR, 2.45\u00b10.49 in MR, and 1.98\u00b10.48 in SO muscles. The mean SIRs after treatment were 1.82\u00b10.62, 1.84\u00b10.52, 1.70\u00b10.35, 1.95\u00b10.46, and 1.60\u00b10.36, respectively. The mean volumes (cm(3)) before treatment were 1.35\u00b10.67 in SR, 1.21\u00b10.39 in IR, 0.66\u00b10.13 in LR, 0.94\u00b10.31 in MR, and 0.58\u00b10.14 in SO muscles. Those after treatment were 1.12\u00b10.45, 0.91\u00b10.31, 0.61\u00b10.12, 0.85\u00b10.28, and 0.49\u00b10.11, respectively. The SIRs showed significantly positive correlations with volumes both before and after treatment in SR muscles (before, r=0.77; after, r=0.69), IR muscles (before, r=0.65; after, r=0.60), MR muscles (before, r=0.69; after, r=0.73), and SO muscles (before, r=0.52; after, r=0.50) (P<0.01 for all correlations).\nSwelling reflected the inflammation in extraocular muscles of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy both before and after treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f15","authors":["Tomoaki Higashiyama","Yasuhiro Nishida","Masahito Ohji"],"doi":"10.2147\/opth.s105096","first_seen_on":"2016-04-21T01:55:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1177-5467"],"journal":"Clinical Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1461203743,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/relationship-between-magnetic-resonance-imaging-signal-intensity-and-v-peer-reviewed-article-OPTH"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=29991","pmid":"27143850","pubdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","title":"Relationship between magnetic resonance imaging signal intensity and volume of extraocular muscles in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy with methylprednisolone pulse therapy","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-between-magnetic-resonance-imaging-signal-intensity-volume-extraocular-muscles-thyroida"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7584550,"mean":6.538792679956,"rank":5739703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1017570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7584550,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267005,"mean":11.298151877874,"rank":186941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43097,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267005,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1222,"mean":2.173027027027,"rank":683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1222,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":1.85,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DovePressEye\/statuses\/722967017486094336","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6844950],"posted_on":"2016-04-21T01:55:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Dove Press Eye","url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/browse_journals.php?pa=view&cat_id=22","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/294808374\/DoveLogoBlock-75_normal.jpg","description":"Latest articles covering all areas of eyecare published in Dove Press open access medical and scientific journals","id_on_source":"DovePressEye","tweeter_id":"53267341","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":37},"tweet_id":"722967017486094336"}]}}
