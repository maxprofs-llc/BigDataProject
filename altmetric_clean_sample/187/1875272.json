Cross-sectional data on prices of healthy and unhealthy beverages were collected from supermarkets, convenience stores, and quick serve restaurants from two lower per capita income areas (Waimanalo and Wai'anae) and two higher per capita income areas (Hawai'i Kai and Manoa) on O'ahu, Hawai'i from May 15 to June 10, 2012. Using composite data from across all areas, there was a significant difference of $0.58 (95% CI 0.46, 0.70) between the healthy beverages' mean price per 20 ounces ($1.76 \u00b1 $0.86) and the unhealthy beverages' mean price per 20 ounces ($1.18 \u00b1 $0.38) (P <.001). Although there was no statistically significant difference between per capita income areas, the lower per capita income areas' mean price per 20 ounces of healthy beverages was slightly higher and mean price per 20 ounces of unhealthy beverages was slightly lower than the higher per capita income areas. Pricing strategies that enable healthy beverages to be less expensive than unhealthy beverages is one method to increase consumption of healthy beverages and decrease consumption of unhealthy beverages. Reduction in unhealthy beverage consumption is needed to help reduce obesity, especially in the lower per capita income areas that have higher obesity prevalence.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Corilee A Watters","Rachel S Corrado","Frank J Chaloupka"],"first_seen_on":"2013-11-01T09:40:09+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"Hawai'i Journal of Medicine & Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1383299300,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3602945\/"],"pmid":"23520564","pubdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"University Clinical, Education & Research Associates","startpage":"76","title":"Prices of Healthy and Unhealthy Beverages in High and Low Per Capita Income Areas","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prices-healthy-unhealthy-beverages-high-low-per-capita-income-areas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
