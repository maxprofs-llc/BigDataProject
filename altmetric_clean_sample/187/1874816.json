Indomethacin\/ibuprofen treatment and ligation of PDA have complications. As a prostaglandin synthase inhibitor paracetamol may also promote the closure of ductus arteriosus. We studied retrospectively whether early paracetamol therapy was associated with decreased incidence of PDA without adverse events. Methods: On June 2009, we introduced intravenous paracetamol during early respiratory therapy. We included 105 VLGA infants who received paracetamol before the age of 72\u2009h. The loading dose was 20\u2009mg\/kg followed by 7.5\u2009mg\/kg every 6 hours. The 96 VLGA infants admitted from January 2008 to May 2009 without lethal congenital disease were controls. Infants dying very early were excluded, leaving 102 paracetamol-exposed and 88 controls for analysis. Results: After the introduction of paracetamol, the incidence of PDA decreased from 30.7% to 14.7% (p\u2009=\u20090.008). Ibuprofen treatment was given to 15 paracetamol-treated and to 26 control infants (p\u2009=\u20090.013). Three paracetamol-exposed and seven control infants required surgery. There was no detectable increase in adverse events. Conclusions: Annual incidence of PDA decreased after introduction of paracetamol. Efficacy and safety in promoting the early closure of ductus arteriosus remains to be established.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610004043","authors":["Outi Aikio","Pia H\u00e4rkin","Timo Saarela","Mikko Hallman"],"doi":"10.3109\/14767058.2013.854327","endpage":"5","first_seen_on":"2013-11-01T03:42:20+00:00","issns":["1476-7058","1476-4954"],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1429619510,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/14767058.2013.854327","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/14767058.2013.854327?ai=1lib&mi=3gfofr&af=R&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed&","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24111688?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24111688","pubdate":"2013-10-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["obstetrics","perinatology"],"title":"Early paracetamol treatment associated with lowered risk of persistent ductus arteriosus in very preterm infants.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/early-paracetamol-treatment-associated-lowered-risk-persistent-ductus-arteriosus-very-preterm-infant"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5021388,"mean":5.9476131311957,"rank":2666740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1681265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5021388,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107656,"mean":7.9914381496448,"rank":53544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":39822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107656,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1044,"mean":1.9696970278044,"rank":332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1044,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":1.8911392405063,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
