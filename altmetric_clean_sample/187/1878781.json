With the increase of STPP concentration and time, no increase in bound phosphate was observed. The highest gel strength was obtained for gelatin phosphorylated using 0.25% STPP for 1h (P<0.05). When the effect of pH (5, 7, 9 and 11) on phosphorylation and gel property of gelatin was investigated, gelatin phosphorylated at pH 9 had the highest gel strength (204.3g) (P<0.05) and exhibited a finer and more compact network structure with smaller pores. Gelatin became negatively charged (-3.89mV) and might undergo an ionic interaction to a higher extent, thereby strengthening the gel network. Thus, the phosphorylation, under the appropriate condition, could improve the gelling property of gelatin from the skin of unicorn leatherjacket.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f5","authors":["Phanngam Kaewruang","Soottawat Benjakul","Thummanoon Prodpran"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.foodchem.2013.09.111","first_seen_on":"2013-11-03T01:22:33+00:00","issns":["0308-8146"],"journal":"Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1383441723,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24176385"],"pmid":"24176385","pubdate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Characteristics and gelling property of phosphorylated gelatin from the skin of unicorn leatherjacket.","type":"article","volume":"146","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characteristics-gelling-property-phosphorylated-gelatin-skin-unicorn-leatherjacket"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3065907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":944354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102508,"mean":7.8715398753259,"rank":68417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":21065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102508,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2105,"mean":2.7949477186312,"rank":1231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2105,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":1.7325454545455,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"BR":1,"AE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/snydr\/status\/396809464918966272","license":"public","citation_ids":[1878781],"posted_on":"2013-11-03T01:22:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Sam Snyder","url":"http:\/\/samsnyder.com","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/461547844042629120\/qeWQG4Fu_normal.jpeg","description":"I work on software and write about biology and medicine.
