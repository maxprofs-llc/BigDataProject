Depending on the species involved, human infections usually manifest as one cutaneous or visceral larva migrans that forms a painless nodule in the later course of disease. Dirofilariae are endemic in the Mediterranean, particularly in Italy. They are considered as emerging pathogens currently increasing their geographical range. We present one of the few known cases of human dirofilariasis caused by D. repens in Romania. The patient developed unusual and severe clinical manifestations that mimicked pathological conditions like cellulitis or deep venous thrombosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef682a83ee09648b4fa2","authors":["Ioana Popescu","Irina Tudose","Paul Racz","Birgit Muntau","Calin Giurcaneanu","Sven Poppert"],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/472976","first_seen_on":"2013-11-01T11:59:39+00:00","issns":["2090-6625"],"journal":"Case Reports in Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1408515266,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3336227\/","http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/criid\/2012\/472976\/"],"pmid":"22567488","pubdate":"2013-11-01T20:12:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":" Human Dirofilaria repens Infection in Romania: A Case Report","type":"article","volume":"2012","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-idirofilaria-repensi-infection-romania-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4759378,"mean":5.7095406108846,"rank":3182701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1388709,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4759378,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105289,"mean":8.0027951523442,"rank":66288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":35114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105289,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Human Dirofilaria repens Infection in Romania: A Case Report","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100000959600966\/posts\/756590427716270","license":"public","citation_ids":[1875619],"posted_on":"2014-08-20T06:14:26+00:00","summary":"A Dirofilaria case study - We did not find signs of infection with D. repens in the patient\u2019s dog.
