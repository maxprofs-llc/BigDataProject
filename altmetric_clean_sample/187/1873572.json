Banking could provide a protective mechanism, placing the foot and ankle in orientations that keep them out of dangerous positions. This study sought to determine the effect of two banking angles on the kinematics and kinetics of the lower extremity during two athletic maneuvers. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected on 10 recreational athletes performing v-cuts and side shuffle movements on different banked surfaces (0\u00b0, 10\u00b0, 20\u00b0). Each sample surface was rigidly attached to the force platform. Joint moments were calculated and compared between conditions using a repeated measures ANOVA. Banking had a pronounced effect on the ankle joint. As banking increased, the amount of joint loading in the transverse and frontal planes decreased likely leading to a reduction in injury risk. Also an increase in knee joint loading in the frontal plane was seen during the 20\u00b0 bank during the v-cut. Conversely loading in the sagittal plane at the ankle joint increased with banking and coupled with a reorientation of the ground reaction vector may facilitate a performance increase. The current study indicates that the 10\u00b0 bank may be the optimal bank, in that it decreases ankle joint loading, as well as increases specific performance variables while not increasing frontal plane knee joint loading. If banking could be incorporated in footwear it may be able to provide a protective mechanism for athletes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002a10","authors":["John W Wannop","Eveline S Graf","Darren J Stefanyshyn"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.humov.2013.07.020","first_seen_on":"2013-10-31T18:48:59+00:00","issns":["1872-7646"],"journal":"Human Movement Science","last_mentioned_on":1383245318,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24074906\/"],"pmid":"24074906","pubdate":"2013-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"The effect of lateral banking on the kinematics and kinetics of the lower extremity during lateral cutting movements.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-lateral-banking-kinematics-kinetics-lower-extremity-during-lateral-cutting-movements"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630565,"mean":4.929464153233,"rank":2015556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":942210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630565,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96158,"mean":7.7514950965611,"rank":49910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":25717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96158,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257,"mean":3.7922421875,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":3.5295454545455,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
