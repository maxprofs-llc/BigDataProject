It has been viewed as a non-specific response to ambient noise, but this assumption has not been thoroughly tested. Two experiments using healthy adults measured intensity, duration, and F0 changes in broadband (0.2-20\u2009kHz) and notched noise (0.05-4\u2009kHz removed) during a picture naming task. The pilot experiment showed that broadband noise containing speech-similar frequencies significantly increased intensity, duration, and F0 while notched noise, which removed the majority of speech-similar frequencies, had no effect. The main experiment added bandpass noise (0.05-4.0\u2009kHz) which contained a major portion of speech-similar frequencies and was the mirror image of the notched noise. Broadband and notched noise results were replicated. Bandpass noise increased intensity and duration, but to a lesser degree than did broadband noise, and had no effect on F0. Findings show that the Lombard effect is sensitive to frequencies vital for speech and is not a general response to any competing sound in the environment. Implications for suprasegmental control of speech are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040f2","authors":["Lauren M. Stowe","Lauren M. Stowe","Edward J.
