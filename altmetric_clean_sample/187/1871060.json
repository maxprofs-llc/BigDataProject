Previous research has shown that using HIE to electronically report laboratory results to public health can improve surveillance practice, yet there has been little utilization of HIE for improving provider-based disease reporting. This article describes a study protocol that uses mixed methods to evaluate an intervention to electronically pre-populate provider-based notifiable disease case reporting forms with clinical, laboratory and patient data available through an operational HIE. The evaluation seeks to: (1) identify barriers and facilitators to implementation, adoption and utilization of the intervention; (2) measure impacts on workflow, provider awareness, and end-user satisfaction; and (3) describe the contextual factors that impact the effectiveness of the intervention within heterogeneous clinical settings and the HIE.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007c4","doi":"10.1186\/1472-6947-13-121","first_seen_on":"2013-10-30T21:16:15+00:00","issns":["1472-6947"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making","last_mentioned_on":1383587120,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6947\/13\/121\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24171799?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6947-13-121.pdf","pmid":"24171799","pubdate":"2013-10-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Geomatic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"121","subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Measuring the impact of a health information exchange intervention on provider-based notifiable disease reporting using mixed methods: a study protocol","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measuring-impact-health-information-exchange-intervention-providerbased-notifiable-disease-reporting-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505915,"mean":5.1093654012801,"rank":1647803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2826612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505915,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102381,"mean":7.815576968158,"rank":32294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":69350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102381,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":754,"mean":3.9356972111554,"rank":295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":754,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":3.92935,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
