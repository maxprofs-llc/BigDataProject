We present the clinicopathological features of 20 Mexican children with HVLL with a median age of 8 years at diagnosis (range, 1-15). All patients presented with skin lesions involving sun-exposed areas, but not exclusively. Fever, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly were often observed. Most patients were treated with immunomodulators and\/or immunosuppressive agents, resulting in temporary remission. For 13 patients follow-up was available for a median of 3 years (range, 1 month-13 years). Three patients with long follow-up (9-13 years) are alive with disease. Four patients died, 2 after developing systemic lymphoma. Histologically, the skin showed a predominantly angiocentric and periadnexal Epstein-Barr early RNA+ lymphoid infiltrate with variable atypia and subcutaneous involvement. Fifteen patients showed a T-cell phenotype (12, \u03b1\u03b2; 2, \u03b3\u03b4; 1, silent phenotype) and monoclonal T-cell receptor-\u03b3 rearrangements, whereas 6 exhibited a natural killer (NK)-cell phenotype. Four patients had hypersensitivity to mosquito bites. One patient showed both phenotypes. HVLL is an EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder of \u03b1\u03b2-, \u03b3\u03b4-, or NK-cell phenotype with a broad clinical spectrum, usually prolonged clinical course, and risk for progression to systemic disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Leticia Quintanilla-Martinez","Cecilia Ridaura","Florian Nagl","Marimar S\u00e1ez-de-Ocariz","Carola Dur\u00e1n-McKinster","Ramon Ruiz-Maldonado","Georgia Alderete","Peter Grube","Carmen Lome-Maldonado","Irina Bonzheim","Falko Fend"],"doi":"10.1182\/blood-2013-05-502203","first_seen_on":"2013-10-31T18:32:52+00:00","issns":["1528-0020"],"journal":"Blood","last_mentioned_on":1402960043,"links":["http:\/\/bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org\/content\/122\/18\/3101.short?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org\/content\/122\/18\/3101.abstract?etoc","http:\/\/bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org\/content\/early\/2013\/08\/27\/blood-2013-05-502203","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1182\/blood-2013-05-502203","http:\/\/bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org\/content\/122\/18\/3101?rss=1&sso-checked=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org\/content\/122\/18\/3101.full.pdf","pmid":"23982171","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma: a chronic EBV+ lymphoproliferative disorder with risk to develop a systemic lymphoma.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hydroa-vacciniformelike-lymphoma-chronic-ebv-lymphoproliferative-disorder-risk-develop-systemic-lymp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":1877526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6094839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145429,"mean":7.0199289820394,"rank":34762,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":110201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145429,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9718,"mean":5.3613296284862,"rank":2513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":7091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9718,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":5.9671538461538,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
