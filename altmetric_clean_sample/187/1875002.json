However, they suffer from low light efficiency due to the low contrast of TiO\u2082 with carbon. We synthesized a novel type of anatase-type TiO\u2082-C hybrid aerogel by a one-pot sol-gel method, which shows a photocatalytic activity for methylene degradation up to 4.23 times that of P25, a commercial photocatalyst from Degussa Inc. The hybrid aerogels are prepared from TiCl\u2084 and resorcinol-furfural, and have a tunable macropore size from 167 to 996 nm. They are formed of submicrometer particles that consist of interwoven anatase and carbon nanoparticles. The anatase nanoparticles have a size of 8-9 nm and a tunable oxygen vacancy from 7.2 to 18.0%. The extremely high activity is ascribed to the large light absorption caused by macropore scattering and oxygen vacancies in the anatase. These findings may open up a new avenue and stimulate further research to improve photocatalytic performance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Xia Shao","Wencong Lu","Rui Zhang","Feng Pan"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep03018","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-11-01T06:29:05+00:00","issns":["xxxx-xxxx","2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1383287335,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2013\/131022\/srep03018\/full\/srep03018.html"],"pmid":"24145581","pubdate":"2013-10-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Synthesis and processing","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Photocatalysis","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Chemical engineering","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Porous materials","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"","subjects":["science"],"title":"Enhanced photocatalytic activity of TiO2-C hybrid aerogels for methylene blue degradation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enhanced-photocatalytic-activity-tio2c-hybrid-aerogels-methylene-blue-degradation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3067087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":944948,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102625,"mean":7.8294603211727,"rank":68858,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":21370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102625,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10918,"mean":11.16184299716,"rank":7462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":2299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10918,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":617,"mean":10.927743506494,"rank":412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":617,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
