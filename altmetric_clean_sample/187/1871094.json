Despite this evidence, it is still unknown whether individual attitudes to use scientific evidence in clinical decision-making influence the position that physicians hold in their professional network. This paper explores how physicians' attitudes towards EBM is related to the network position they occupy within healthcare organizations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bb","doi":"10.1186\/1472-6963-13-429","first_seen_on":"2013-10-30T21:42:01+00:00","issns":["1472-6963"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Health Services Research","last_mentioned_on":1385469120,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/13\/429\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6963-13-429.pdf","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/13\/429","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3815661\/?report=classic"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6963-13-429.pdf","pmid":"24148207","pubdate":"2013-10-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"429","subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"\u201cUs and Them\u201d: a social network analysis of physicians\u2019 professional networks and their attitudes towards EBM","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/them-social-network-analysis-physicians-professional-networks-attitudes-towards-ebm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":993743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3501629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102384,"mean":7.8455642635987,"rank":27612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":74381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102384,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2076,"mean":4.0909253012048,"rank":638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":1415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2076,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131,"mean":4.3878153846154,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
