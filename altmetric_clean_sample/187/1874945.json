The disorder could be related to a reduced left hemisphere dominance, which functional neuroimaging data suggest might lead to right hemispheric motor and premotor overactivation. Alternatively, the core deficit underlying stuttering might be located in the speech-dominant left hemisphere. Furthermore, magnetoencephalography study results show profound timing disturbances between areas involved in language preparation and execution in the left hemisphere, suggesting that persistent developmental stuttering might be related to impaired neuronal communication, possibly caused by a disruption of white matter fibre tracts. We aimed to establish whether disconnection between speech-related cortical areas was the structural basis of persistent developmental stuttering.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008b2a","authors":["Martin Sommer","Martin A Koch","Walter Paulus","Cornelius Weiller","Christian B\u00fcchel","Sommer, Martin","Koch, Martin A","Paulus, Walter","Weiller, Cornelius","B\u00fcchel, Christian"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0140-6736(02)09610-1","endpage":"383","first_seen_on":"2013-11-01T05:31:40+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0140-6736","01406736"],"issue":"9330","journal":"The Lancet","last_mentioned_on":1382456340,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12241779"],"pmid":"12241779","pubdate":"2002-08-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"380","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Disconnection of speech-relevant brain areas in persistent developmental stuttering.","type":"article","volume":"360","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/disconnection-speechrelevant-brain-areas-persistent-developmental-stuttering"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685110,"mean":4.9372923047901,"rank":614160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3055287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685110,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96945,"mean":7.7050925482754,"rank":20077,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":76606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96945,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14067,"mean":16.892217119295,"rank":5755,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":8233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14067,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":401,"mean":15.372725,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":401,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Ph.
