Some of the studies have methodological shortcomings, but in all studies the results point in the same direction: aerobic exercise is more effective than no treatment, but not significantly different from other forms of therapy, including various forms of psychotherapy. Aerobic and anaerobic forms of exercise are equally effective. The results are restricted to patients with mild to moderate forms of unipolar depression. Patients appreciate exercise and consider it a useful form of therapy. Physical exercise may be an alternative or adjunct to traditional forms of treatment in mild to moderate forms of unipolar depression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002164","authors":["E W Martinsen"],"first_seen_on":"2013-10-30T23:05:39+00:00","issns":["0065-1591"],"journal":"Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica.
