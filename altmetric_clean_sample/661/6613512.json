Sample pretreatment consisted of a first step using a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe based extraction procedure and a subsequent clean-up step based on solid-phase extraction. The method was extensively validated in wheat flour and rice, obtaining satisfactory analytical performance with good linearity (R(2) \u2265 0.999), acceptable recoveries (80.0-104.4%) and repeatability (RSDs 1.3-10.7%). The limits of detection (21.7-57.4 \u03bcg\/kg) and quantitation (72.3-191.4 \u03bcg\/kg) for deoxynivalenols were lower than those usually permitted by various countries' legislation in these food matrices. The method was applied to 34 wheat and rice samples. The results were further compared with results of ultra high performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. This article is protected by copyright.
