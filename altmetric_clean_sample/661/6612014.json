Little research has been performed to distinguish whether growth patterns in hemiplegic, diplegic, and quadriplegic CP differ from one another. The purpose of this study was to compare growth of children with quadriplegic, hemiplegic, and diplegic CP.\nRetrospective data were collected from the electronic medical record of patients with CP at an outpatient center. Linear mixed models were used to examine growth by diagnosis, using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis codes 343.0 (diplegia), 343.1 (hemiplegia), and 343.2 (quadriplegia).\nHeights and weights of children with quadriplegic CP were consistently lower than those with hemiplegic or diplegic CP. Children with hemiplegic CP had greater heights and weights than other CP subtypes. There were statistically significant differences in weight gain curves among the three diagnoses for males (p<0.05).\nOur study reveals differences in growth rates between hemiplegic, diplegic, and quadriplegic CP subtypes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f3","authors":["Stanek, Jeremy L","Emerson, Jane A","Murdock, Fred A","Petroski, Gregory F"],"doi":"10.1111\/dmcn.13116","first_seen_on":"2016-04-11T15:08:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1469-8749"],"journal":"Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1461075961,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27059686?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27059686"],"pmid":"27059686","pubdate":"2016-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology","pediatrics"],"title":"Growth characteristics in cerebral palsy subtypes: a comparative assessment","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/growth-characteristics-cerebral-palsy-subtypes-comparative-assessment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7571218,"mean":6.5337981331095,"rank":3270792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4214962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7571218,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272056,"mean":11.318382731433,"rank":113929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":154114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272056,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1656,"mean":3.3168072507553,"rank":832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1656,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":5.3257857142857,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
