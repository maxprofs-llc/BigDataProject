The novelty of the study is the evaluation of soluble tissue metal concentrations in gammarids as indicators in early assessment of metal exposure. In the Sutla River, industrially\/rurally\/agriculturally influenced catchment in North-Western Croatia, physico-chemical water properties pointed to disturbed ecological status, which was reflected on population scale as more than 50 times lower gammarid density compared to the reference location, \u010crnomerec Stream. Significantly higher levels of soluble toxic metals (Al, As, Cd, Pb, Sb, Sn, Sr) were observed in gammarids from the Sutla River compared to the reference site and reflected the data on higher total dissolved metal levels in the river water at that site. The soluble metal estimates were supplemented with the common multibiomarker approach, which showed significant biological responses for decreased acetylcholinesterase activity and increased total soluble protein concentrations, confirming stressed environmental conditions for biota in the Sutla River. Biomarker of metal exposure, metallothionein, was not induced and therefore, toxic effect of metals was not confirmed on molecular level. Comparable between-site pattern of soluble toxic metals in gammarids and total dissolved metal levels in water suggests that prior to biomarker response and observed toxic impact, soluble metals in tissue might be used as early warning signs of metal impact in the aquatic environment and improve the assessment of water quality.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024f7","authors":["Filipovi\u0107 Mariji\u0107, Vlatka","Dragun, Zrinka","Serti\u0107 Peri\u0107, Mirela","Matoni\u010dkin Kep\u010dija, Renata","Gulin, Vesna","Velki, Mirna","E\u010dimovi\u0107, Sandra","Hackenberger, Branimir K","Erk, Marijana"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chemosphere.2016.03.058","endpage":"309","first_seen_on":"2016-04-11T15:05:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1298","00456535"],"journal":"Chemosphere","last_mentioned_on":1460387076,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27060638?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27060638","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"300","subjects":["chemistry","biology","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Investigation of the soluble metals in tissue as biological response pattern to environmental pollutants (Gammarus fossarum example)","type":"article","volume":"154","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/investigation-soluble-metals-tissue-biological-response-pattern-environmental-pollutants-gammarus-fo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7534762,"mean":6.5107844469081,"rank":6527168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7534762,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271525,"mean":11.314006356712,"rank":229058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271525,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3227,"mean":3.2772715437074,"rank":2847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3227,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":2.6995135135135,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
