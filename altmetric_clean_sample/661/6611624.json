This brief commentary is related to a previously published paper in this journal, and suggests that most of the conflicting results on the prognostic impact of the irradiation of patients with single lymph node metastasis originate from the unclear role of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in response to adjuvant radiotherapy in vulvar cancer patients. Now that we know certain HPV-related cancers are very sensitive to radiotherapy and have a better prognosis than those unrelated to HPV, future research may focus on appropriate cases for adjuvant treatment going forward.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002692","authors":["Jacek J.
