They catalyze the last step of the synthesis and\/or the initial step of the degradation of this class of amino acids. In Arabidopsis, seven putative BCAT genes are identified by their similarity to their counterparts from other organisms. We have now cloned the respective cDNA sequences of six of these genes. The deduced amino acid sequences show between 47.5% and 84.1% identity to each other and about 30% to the homologous enzymes from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and mammals. In addition, many amino acids in crucial positions as determined by crystallographic analyses of BCATs from Escherichia coli and human (Homo sapiens) are conserved in the AtBCATs. Complementation of a yeast Deltabat1\/Deltabat2 double knockout strain revealed that five AtBCATs can function as BCATs in vivo. Transient expression of BCAT:green fluorescent protein fusion proteins in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) protoplasts shows that three isoenzymes are imported into chloroplasts (AtBCAT-2, -3, and -5), whereas a single enzyme is directed into mitochondria (AtBCAT-1).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333b","authors":["Ruth Diebold","Joachim Schuster","Klaus D\u00e4schner","Stefan Binder","Diebold, Ruth","Schuster, Joachim","D\u00e4schner, Klaus","Binder, Stefan"],"doi":"10.1104\/pp.001602","endpage":"550","first_seen_on":"2016-04-12T00:47:22+00:00","issns":["1532-2548","00320889","0032-0889"],"issue":"2","journal":"Plant Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1460425010,"links":["http:\/\/www.plantphysiol.org\/content\/129\/2\/540","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1104\/pp.001602","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12068099","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC161671"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.plantphysiol.org\/content\/129\/2\/540.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC161671","pmid":"12068099","pubdate":"2002-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"540","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"The Branched-Chain Amino Acid Transaminase Gene Family in Arabidopsis Encodes Plastid and Mitochondrial Proteins","type":"article","volume":"129","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/branchedchain-amino-acid-transaminase-gene-family-arabidopsis-encodes-plastid-mitochondrial-proteins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7540906,"mean":6.5135694142772,"rank":1822882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4710852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7540906,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271088,"mean":11.328164205587,"rank":87621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":179850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271088,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627,"mean":3.851000551572,"rank":845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172,"mean":6.8773918128655,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
