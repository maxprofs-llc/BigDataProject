Surveys and anthropometric assessments were carried out when the children were approximately ages 1, 5 and 8\u2005years. Risk of maternal common mental disorders (rCMDs) was assessed with the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ)-20 (score \u22658).\nRural and urban as well as low- and middle-income communities.\n7722 mothers and their children.\nChild stunting and underweight (Z score \u22642 of height and weight for age), and <20th centile for: cognitive development (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test), and the psychosocial outcomes self pride and life satisfaction.\nA high rate of rCMD, stunting and underweight was seen in the cohorts. After adjusting for confounders, significant associations were found between maternal rCMDs and growth variables in the first year of life, with persistence to age 8\u2005years in India and Vietnam, but not in the other countries. India and Vietnam also showed significant associations between rCMDs and lower cognitive development. After adjustment, rCMD was associated with low life satisfaction in Ethiopia but not in the other cohorts.\nAssociations of maternal rCMD in the first year of life with child outcomes varied across the study cohorts and, in some cases, persisted across the first 8\u2005years of life of the child, and included growth, cognitive development and psychosocial domains.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8083cf058f61000ba9f","authors":["Ian M Bennett","Whitney Schott","Sofya Krutikova","Jere R Behrman","Bennett, Ian M","Schott, Whitney","Krutikova, Sofya","Behrman, Jere R"],"doi":"10.1136\/jech-2014-205311","endpage":"173","first_seen_on":"2016-02-09T18:57:05+00:00","issns":["1470-2738","0143-005X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (1978)","last_mentioned_on":1455195733,"links":["http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/70\/2\/168"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/70\/2\/168.full.pdf","pmid":"26359503","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Geography","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"168","subjects":["publichealth","healthservices","epidemiology"],"title":"Maternal mental health, and child growth and development, in four low-income and middle-income countries","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/09\/10\/jech-2014-205311.abstract","volume":"70","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/maternal-mental-health-child-growth-development-four-lowincome-middleincome-countries-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7182236,"mean":6.3148176187464,"rank":1338683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5840353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7182236,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":321270,"mean":9.5557071986401,"rank":74756,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":246270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":321270,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2185,"mean":14.209487179487,"rank":806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":1378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2185,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":39.777921568627,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
