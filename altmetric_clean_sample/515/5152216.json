Though much is known about aphid-Buchnera interactions, the effect of host plant on Buchnera population size remains unclear. Here we use qPCR techniques to explore the effects of host plant on Buchnera densities in the cotton-melon aphid, Aphis gossypii. Buchnera titres were significantly higher in populations that had been reared on cucumber for over ten years compared with populations maintained on cotton for a similar length of time. Aphids collected in the wild from hibiscus and zucchini harbored more Buchnera than those collected from cucumber and cotton. The effect of aphid genotype on population size of Buchnera depended on the host plant upon which they fed. When aphids from populations maintained on cucumber or cotton were transferred to novel host plants, host survival and Buchnera population size fluctuated markedly for the first two generations before becoming relatively stable after the third generation. Host plant extracts from cucumber, pumpkin, zucchini and cowpea added to artificial diets led to a significant increase in Buchnera in the aphids from the population reared on cotton, while plant extracts from cotton and zucchini led to a decrease in Buchnera titres in the aphids reared on cucumber. Gossypol, a secondary metabolite from cotton, suppressed Buchnera populations in both populations from cotton and cucumber, while cucurbitacin from cucurbit plants led to higher densities. Together the results suggest that host plants influence Buchnera population processes and that this may provide phenotypic plasticity in host plant use for clonal aphids.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["Yuan-Chen Zhang","Wen-Jie Cao","Le-Rong Zhong","H Charles J Godfray","Xiang-Dong Liu","H.
