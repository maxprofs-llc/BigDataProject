The cacao ingredient contains caffeine analogues and biogenic amines, such as \u03b2-phenylethylamine, with assumed antiparkinsonian effects. We thus tested the effects of 200 g of chocolate containing 80 % of cacao on UPDRS motor score after 1 and 3 h in 26 subjects with moderate non-fluctuating PD in a mono-center, single-dose, investigator-blinded crossover study using cacao-free white chocolate as placebo comparator. At 1 h after chocolate intake, mean UPDRS motor scores were mildly decreased compared to baseline in both treatments with significant results only for dark chocolate [-1.3 (95 % CI 0.18-2.52, RMANOVA F = 4.783, p = 0.013\u00b8 Bonferroni p = 0.021 for 1 h values)]. A 2 \u00d7 2-cross-over analysis revealed no significant differences between both treatments [-0.54 \u00b1 0.47 (95 % CI -1.50 to 0.42), p = 0.258]. Similar results were obtained at 3 h after intake. \u03b2-phenylethylamine blood levels were unaltered. Together, chocolate did not show significant improvement over white cacao-free chocolate in PD motor function.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e77","doi":"10.1007\/s00415-012-6527-1","first_seen_on":"2012-05-16T08:08:20+00:00","issns":["1432-1459"],"journal":"Journal of Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1436789256,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22584952"],"pmid":"22584952","pubdate":"2012-05-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Comparison of chocolate to cacao-free white chocolate in Parkinson's disease: a single-dose, investigator-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-chocolate-cacaofree-white-chocolate-parkinsons-disease-singledose-investigatorblinded-pla"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5348412,"mean":6.2582893457538,"rank":528136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":4797919,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5348412,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82082,"mean":4.9160606717754,"rank":7413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":74383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82082,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1446,"mean":3.0531404844291,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":1350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1446,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":1.3381578947368,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":11,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":10,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
