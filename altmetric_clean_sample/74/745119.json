It is possible that preferential copackaging of homodimers in the case of gammaretroviruses, like murine leukemia virus (MLV), led to the underestimation of their rates of recombination. To reexamine the recombination rates for MLV, experiments were performed to control for nonrandom copackaging of viral RNA, and it was found that MLV and HIV-1 exhibit similar crossover rates. The implications for control of proviral ploidy and preferential recombination during minus-strand DNA synthesis are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Zhuang J","Mukherjee S","Ron Y","Dougherty JP"],"doi":"10.1128\/jvi.00273-06","first_seen_on":"2012-05-15T21:24:37+00:00","issns":["0022-538X"],"issue":"13","journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1337116709,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16775360"],"pmcid":"PMC1488982","pmid":"16775360","pubdate":"2006-06-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"High rate of genetic recombination in murine leukemia virus: implications for influencing proviral ploidy.","type":"article","volume":"80","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-rate-genetic-recombination-murine-leukemia-virus-implications-influencing-proviral-ploidy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3083204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":966609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77526,"mean":4.534533144147,"rank":48514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":17406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77526,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5119,"mean":3.0776271981243,"rank":3579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5119,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":1.5473684210526,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":9,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"ZA":1,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/MyalgicEncephal\/status\/202508274157879296","citation_ids":[745119],"posted_on":"2012-05-15T21:18:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Myalgic Encephalomye","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/TULGXqtSo7","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/416540894020386816\/dLqkTET7_normal.jpeg","description":"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis\r\n\r\n(this account has over 30,000 tweets & is not at all associated with any other account using the same name & image)","id_on_source":"MyalgicEncephal","tweeter_id":"242838789","geo":{"_id":"\u042d\u043d\u044d \u043d\u044c \u0434\u044d\u043b\u0445\u0438\u0439\u043d"},"followers":875},"tweet_id":"202508274157879296"}]}}
