An important aim of knee arthroplasty is functional recovery, which should include a post-operative increase in walking speed. Still, there are several problems with measuring walking speed in groups of knee osteoarthritis patients. Nevertheless, test-retest reliability of walking speed measurements is high, and when the same investigators monitor the same subjects, it should be possible to assess the walking speed effects of knee arthroplasty. The present study reports a meta-analysis of these effects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ca","authors":["Hamid Abbasi-Bafghi","Hamid Abbasi-Bafghi","Hamid R Fallah-Yakhdani","Onno G Meijer","Henrica CW de Vet","Sjoerd M Bruijn","Li-Yong Yang","Dirk L Knol","Barend J Van Royen","Jaap H van Die\u00ebn"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2474-13-66","first_seen_on":"2012-05-15T12:37:57+00:00","issns":["","1471-2474"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1337085134,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2474-13-66.pdf"],"pmid":"22559793","pubdate":"2012-05-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"66","subjects":["orthopedics","physiology"],"title":"The effects of knee arthroplasty on walking speed: A meta-analysis","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-knee-arthroplasty-walking-speed-metaanalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634284,"mean":4.9206846148246,"rank":2015304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634284,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74650,"mean":4.2138424359334,"rank":32840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":28437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74650,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1373,"mean":3.411415451895,"rank":828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1373,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":4.29505,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
