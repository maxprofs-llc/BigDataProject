A key gene of AD, ADAM10, controls the proteolytic processing of APP and the formation of the amyloid plaques and is known to be regulated by miRNA in hepatic cancer cell lines. To predict miRNAs regulating ADAM10 expression concerning AD, we developed a computational approach.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007c1","authors":["Regina Augustin","Regina Augustin","Kristina Endres","Sven Reinhardt","Peer-Hendrik Kuhn","Stefan F Lichtenthaler","Jens Hansen","Wolfgang Wurst","Dietrich Tr\u00fcmbach"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2350-13-35","first_seen_on":"2012-05-17T17:51:37+00:00","issns":["","1471-2350"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Medical Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1337714659,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2350\/13\/35\/abstract"],"pmid":"22594617","pubdate":"2012-05-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"35","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Computational identification and experimental validation of microRNAs binding to the Alzheimer-related gene ADAM10","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/computational-identification-experimental-validation-micrornas-binding-alzheimerrelated-gene-adam10"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":2312074,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1574833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75853,"mean":4.6363272161577,"rank":33840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":31209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75853,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":412,"mean":2.4266520681265,"rank":196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":412,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":10.448923076923,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
