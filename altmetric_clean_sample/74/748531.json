Since most NSCLC are diagnosed on small biopsy or cytologic specimens, an accurate but tissue-sparing approach is necessary. To date, consensus for a general diagnostic algorithm is lacking. To test the diagnostic and clinical relevance of the recently published multidisciplinary guidelines by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, American Thoracic Society, and European Respiratory Society, we examined 371 surgically resected NSCLCs brought into tissue microarray format. The antibody panel thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), p63, cytokeratin (CK)5\/6, and CK7 is diagnostic for most cases (>94%). Faint\/focal staining for CK7 is negligible for classificatory purposes. Grading adenocarcinomas according to histologic architecture is prognostically significant (median overall survival for well\/moderate differentiation, 72.5 months; for poor differentiation, 38.5 months; P = .019). Double stains combining the aforementioned nuclear and membranous markers are highly diagnostic for NSCLC, conserving tumor tissue for subsequent analyses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f4","doi":"10.1309\/ajcp77kmkjxnmpms","first_seen_on":"2012-05-17T13:39:29+00:00","issns":["1943-7722"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Clinical Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1337562513,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22586054?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22586054","pubdate":"2012-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Tissue-Sparing Application of the Newly Proposed IASLC\/ATS\/ERS Classification of Adenocarcinoma of the Lung Shows Practical Diagnostic and Prognostic Impact.","type":"article","volume":"137","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tissuesparing-application-newly-proposed-iaslcatsers-classification-adenocarcinoma-lung-shows-practi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":2328492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1533886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75852,"mean":4.6025826422855,"rank":33976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":30303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75852,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":804,"mean":2.105895392279,"rank":381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":804,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":1.3287058823529,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
