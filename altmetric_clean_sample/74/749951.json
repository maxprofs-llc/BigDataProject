Searching for the brain location of intentions, beliefs and desires-as such-might not be the best epistemic strategy to disclose what social cognition really is. The results of neurocognitive research suggest that in the brain of primates, mirror neurons, and more generally the premotor system, play a major role in several aspects of social cognition, from action and intention understanding to language processing. This evidence is presented and discussed within the theoretical frame of an embodied simulation account of social cognition. Embodied simulation and the mirror neuron system underpinning it provide the means to share communicative intentions, meaning and reference, thus granting the parity requirements of social communication.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032f2","authors":["","Vittorio Gallese"],"doi":"10.1098\/rstb.2006.2002","first_seen_on":"2012-05-18T10:10:40+00:00","issns":["1471-2970","0962-8436"],"issue":"1480","journal":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1443428429,"links":["http:\/\/rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/362\/1480\/659.long","http:\/\/rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/362\/1480\/659.short","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2346524"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/362\/1480\/659.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC2346524","pmid":"17301027","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"659","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Before and below \u2018theory of mind\u2019: embodied simulation and the neural correlates of social cognition","type":"article","volume":"362","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/before-below-theory-mind-embodied-simulation-neural-correlates-social-cognition-26"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7662680,"mean":6.5823510461499,"rank":3744845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3722702,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7662680,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92761,"mean":5.2165605864597,"rank":40382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":49546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92761,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3209,"mean":10.950907107232,"rank":2476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3209,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":8.3264615384615,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
