Any thoughts in Indole-3-Carbinol ? Have you come across this paper ?","Indole3Carbinol has potential role in obesity prevention","I3C decrease adipogenesis inflammation, along with activated thermogenesis"],"citation":{"abstract":"Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a compound found in high concentrations in Brassica family vegetables, including broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage, and is regarded as a promising chemopreventive agent against various cancers. This study assesses the protective effect of I3C against diet-induced obesity in mice. Mice were randomly grouped to receive either a normal diet, high-fat (40% energy as fat) diet (HFD) or I3C-supplemented diet (1 g\/kg diet) for 10 weeks. I3C supplementation significantly ameliorated HFD-induced increases in body weight gain, visceral fat pad weights and plasma lipid levels. The visceral adipose tissue mRNA levels of uncoupling proteins 1 and 3, crucial factors of thermogenesis, and their regulators such as sirtuin 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1, which were down-regulated by HFD, were normalized by supplementation with I3C. In contrast, I3C supplementation significantly decreased expression levels of a key adipogenic transcription factor, PPAR\u03b32, and its target genes, such as leptin and adipocyte protein 2, in the visceral adipose tissue of mice maintained on the HFD. Furthermore, HFD-induced up-regulation in mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, interferon \u03b2 and interleukin 6) was significantly ameliorated by I3C. These findings suggest that I3C has a potential benefit in preventing obesity and metabolic disorders, and the action for I3C in vivo may involve multiple mechanisms including decreased adipogenesis and inflammation, along with activated thermogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8f","authors":["Choi Y","Kim Y","Park S","Lee KW","Park T"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jnutbio.2011.12.005","endpage":"1739","first_seen_on":"2012-05-15T14:46:14+00:00","issns":["0955-2863","09552863"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1483883533,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22569347","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22569347"],"pmid":"22569347","pubdate":"2012-05-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1732","subjects":["biochemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Indole-3-carbinol prevents diet-induced obesity through modulation of multiple genes related to adipogenesis, thermogenesis or inflammation in the visceral adipose tissue of mice.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/indole3carbinol-prevents-dietinduced-obesity-through-modulation-multiple-genes-related-adipogenesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019832,"mean":6.784478957969,"rank":3428319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4477287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019832,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95901,"mean":5.2726134098019,"rank":33977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":60076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95901,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":905,"mean":7.0546991150442,"rank":376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":905,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.95555555555556,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
