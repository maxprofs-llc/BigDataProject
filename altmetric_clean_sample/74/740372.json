Transmission of the hepatitis B virus, despite the availability of the vaccine, still occurs, particularly in the perinatal setting. Studies have shown that mothers with active viremia especially those with very high viral levels (>10\u2078 copies\/mL or >10\u2077 IU\/mL) are at increased risk of hepatitis B virus transmission, even with appropriate immunoprophylaxis at birth. With the development of new and relatively safe oral antiviral therapies, assessment with the mother about the risks and benefits of antiviral therapy should be discussed in those with highest transmission risk.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002569","doi":"10.1097\/grf.0b013e318251097a","first_seen_on":"2012-05-12T11:56:35+00:00","issns":["0009-9201"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical Obstetrics & Gynecology","last_mentioned_on":1338501671,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/clinicalobgyn\/Abstract\/2012\/06000\/Hepatitis_B___Treatment_to_Prevent_Perinatal.23.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/clinicalobgyn\/2012\/06000\/Hepatitis_B___Treatment_to_Prevent_Perinatal.23.pdf","pmid":"22510637","pubdate":"2012-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins (250 Waterloo Road, London SE1 8RD, United Kingdom)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"541","subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Hepatitis B:  Treatment to Prevent Perinatal Transmission","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hepatitis-b-544"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":3111921,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1004484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76408,"mean":4.5250542751318,"rank":48204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":18993,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76408,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":685,"mean":1.6503040935673,"rank":560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":685,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.4692307692308,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/ClinObGyn\/status\/201279218506665985","citation_ids":[740372],"posted_on":"2012-05-12T11:54:39+00:00","author":{"name":"ClinObGyn","url":"http:\/\/www.clinicalobgyn.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1593299003\/COG_twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Each issue of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology is a complete symposium on one or two timely topics of interest in obstetrics and gynecology.","id_on_source":"ClinObGyn","tweeter_id":"392937980","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1218},"tweet_id":"201279218506665985"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/ClinObGyn\/status\/208317224199520256","citation_ids":[740372],"posted_on":"2012-05-31T22:01:11+00:00","author":{"name":"ClinObGyn","url":"http:\/\/www.clinicalobgyn.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1593299003\/COG_twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Each issue of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology is a complete symposium on one or two timely topics of interest in obstetrics and gynecology.","id_on_source":"ClinObGyn","tweeter_id":"392937980","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1218},"tweet_id":"208317224199520256"}]}}
