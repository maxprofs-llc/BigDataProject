In this study, DQB alleles were analysed for the water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), another economically important bovine species. Twelve alleles for Bubu-DQB (Bubalis bubalis DQB) were determined by nucleotide sequence analysis. A phylogenetic analysis revealed numerous trans-species polymorphisms, with alleles from water buffalo assigned to at least three different loci (BoLA-DQB1, BoLA-DQB3 and BoLA-DQB4) that are also found in cattle. These presumptive loci were analysed for patterns of synonymous (d(S)) and non-synonymous (d(N)) substitution. Like BoLA-DQB1, Bubu-DQB1 was observed to be under strong positive selection for polymorphism. We conclude that water buffalo and cattle share the current arrangement of their DQB region because of their common ancestry.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000225b","authors":["Sena L","Schneider MP","Brenig BB","Honeycutt RL","Honeycutt DA","Womack JE","Skow LC"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2052.2010.02157.x","first_seen_on":"2012-05-14T13:31:14+00:00","issns":["0268-9146"],"issue":"4","journal":"Animal Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1337002188,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21749420"],"pmid":"21749420","pubdate":"2011-07-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Polymorphism and gene organization of water buffalo MHC-DQB genes show homology to the BoLA DQB region.","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polymorphism-gene-organization-water-buffalo-mhcdqb-genes-show-homology-bola-dqb-region"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627150,"mean":4.9502167410311,"rank":2018509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627150,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74217,"mean":4.2610965021019,"rank":32826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":27843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74217,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":333,"mean":2.4934277108434,"rank":180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":333,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.61428571428571,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
