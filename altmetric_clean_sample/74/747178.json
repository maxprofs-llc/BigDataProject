Most often, however, processing and end-use of these materials (especially copolymers) is optimized empirically, due to a lack of understanding of the physicochemical phase-space occupied by the macromolecules. Here, this shortcoming is addressed via a quintuple-detector size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) method consisting of multiangle static light scattering (MALS), quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS), differential viscometry (VISC), ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy (UV), and differential refractometry (DRI) coupled online to the separation method. Applying the SEC\/MALS\/QELS\/VISC\/UV\/DRI method to the study of a poly(acrylamide-co-N,N-dimethylacrylamide) copolymer in which both monomer functionalities absorb in the same region of the UV spectrum, we demonstrate how to determine the chemical heterogeneity, molar mass averages and distribution, and solution conformation of the copolymer all in a single analysis. Additionally, through the various mutually independent conformational and architectural metrics provided by combining the five detectors, including the fractal dimension (derived from two different detector combinations), two different dimensionless size parameters, the chemical heterogeneity, and the persistence length, it is shown that the monomeric arrangement is more alternating than random at lower molar masses, thus causing the copolymer to adopt a more extended conformation in solution in this molar mass (M) regime. At high M, however, the copolymer is shown to be and to behave more like a random coil homopolymer, after passing through a 250 kg mol(-1)-broad region of intermediate chain flexibility. Thus, the combination of five detectors provides a unique means by which to determine absolute properties of the copolymer, solution-specific physical behavior, and the underlying chemical basis of the latter. The quintuple-detector method was also extended to the study of blends of polyacrylamide and poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) homopolymers to quantitate their molar mass, solution conformation, and chemical heterogeneity and to shed light on the breadth of the distributions of the component species. The method presented should be applicable to the study of copolymers and blends in which either one or both component moieties or polymers absorb in the UV region and can be implemented using not only SEC but other size-based separation methods as well.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Steven M.
