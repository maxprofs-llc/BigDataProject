We sought to determine the rate of persistent AF termination achievable with a stepwise ablation strategy, the predictors of AF termination, and the clinical outcomes associated with termination and nontermination. A total of 143 consecutive patients (age 62 \u00b1 9 years, AF duration 5.7 \u00b1 5.2 years) with persistent and longstanding persistent AF resistant to antiarrhythmic medication who presented in AF for catheter ablation were studied. Ablation was done with a stepwise approach, including pulmonary vein isolation, followed by complex fractionated atrial electrogram ablation and ablation of resultant atrial tachycardias. Clinical follow-up was then performed after a 2-month blanking period to assess arrhythmia recurrence, defined as AF or atrial tachycardia lasting \u2265 30 seconds. AF termination by ablation was achieved in 95 (66%) of the 143 patients. Multivariate predictors of AF termination included longer baseline AF cycle length (p <0.001) and smaller left atrial size (p = 0.002). AF termination by ablation was associated with both a lower incidence of arrhythmia recurrence after a single procedure without antiarrhythmic drugs (p = 0.01) and overall clinical success (single or multiple procedures, with or without antiarrhythmic drugs; p = 0.005). On multivariate analysis, the predictors of overall clinical success included AF termination by ablation (p = 0.001), a shorter ablation duration (p = 0.002), younger age (p = 0.02), male gender (p = 0.03), and the presence of hypertension (p = 0.03). In conclusion, among patients with persistent AF, termination of AF by ablation can be achieved in most patients and is associated with reduced recurrence of arrhythmia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f0","authors":["Mansour, Moussa"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjcard.2012.04.028","first_seen_on":"2012-05-17T00:27:45+00:00","issns":["0002-9149"],"journal":"American Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1337214234,"links":["http:\/\/www.ajconline.org\/article\/S0002-9149(12)01188-5\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajconline.org\/article\/S0002-9149(12)01188-5\/pdf","pmid":"22591670","pubdate":"2012-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Predictors of Atrial Fibrillation Termination and Clinical Success of Catheter Ablation of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predictors-atrial-fibrillation-termination-clinical-success-catheter-ablation-persistent-atrial-fibr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3083081,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":966269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75853,"mean":4.6330774666455,"rank":47710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":17013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75853,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2792,"mean":3.1426979577212,"rank":1655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2792,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":3.2841355932203,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
