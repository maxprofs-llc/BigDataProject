Constitutive mitochondrial uptake of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca\u00b2\u207a mediated by inositol triphosphate receptors (IP\u2083Rs) maintains cellular bioenergetics, thus suppressing autophagy. We show that the ER membrane protein Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) promotes autophagy in an IP\u2083R-dependent manner. By reducing steady-state levels of ER Ca\u00b2\u207a via IP\u2083Rs, BI-1 influences mitochondrial bioenergetics, reducing oxygen consumption, impacting cellular ATP levels, and stimulating autophagy. Furthermore, BI-1-deficient mice show reduced basal autophagy, and experimentally reducing BI-1 expression impairs tumor xenograft growth in vivo. BI-1's ability to promote autophagy could be dissociated from its known function as a modulator of IRE1 signaling in the context of ER stress. The results reveal BI-1 as a novel autophagy regulator that bridges Ca\u00b2\u207a signaling between ER and mitochondria, reducing cellular oxygen consumption and contributing to cellular resilience in the face of metabolic stress.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293c","authors":["R.
