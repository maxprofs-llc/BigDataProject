However, our knowledge about the regulatory mechanisms and functions of miRNAs remains very limited. The main difficulties lie in two aspects. On one hand, the number of experimentally validated miRNA targets is very limited and the predicted targets often include many false positives, which constrains us to reveal the functions of miRNAs. On the other hand, the regulation of miRNAs is known to be spatio-temporally specific, which increases the difficulty for us to understand the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d4","authors":["Hui Liu","Hui Liu","Ting Jin","Ruiqi Liao","Linxia Wan","Bin Xu","Shuigeng Zhou","Jihong Guan"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2229-12-68","first_seen_on":"2012-05-14T20:22:38+00:00","issns":["","1471-2229"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Plant Biology","last_mentioned_on":1337091668,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2229\/12\/68\/abstract"],"pmid":"22583976","pubdate":"2012-05-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"68","subjects":["botany"],"title":"miRFANs: an integrated database for Arabidopsis thaliana microRNA function annotations","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mirfans-integrated-database-arabidopsis-thaliana-microrna-function-annotations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.096,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.096},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5230584,"mean":6.1640633275514,"rank":664042,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":4566737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5230584,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80911,"mean":4.8930757879125,"rank":9242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":71667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80911,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":911,"mean":3.0454065934066,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":855,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":911,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":2.1552631578947,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
