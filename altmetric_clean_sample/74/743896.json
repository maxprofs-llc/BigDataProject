It is a correctable cause of obstructive jaundice in infants and is generally treated surgically. Here, we present a case of a 5-month-old infant with bile-plug syndrome, which was treated by percutaneous biliary interventions. To the best of our knowledge, percutaneous treatment of bile-plug syndrome is reported for the first time in an infant. This minimal invasive treatment modality may be a useful alternative to surgery in infants with bile-plug syndrome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dd6","authors":["Duman L","B\u00fcy\u00fckyavuz BI","Akcam M","Koroglu M","Tepeli H"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jpedsurg.2011.09.053","first_seen_on":"2012-05-15T10:39:58+00:00","issns":["0022-3468"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of Pediatric Surgery (Science Direct)","last_mentioned_on":1337077818,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22152905?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22152905","pubdate":"2011-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pediatrics"],"title":"Percutaneous management of bile-plug syndrome: a case report.","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/percutaneous-management-bileplug-syndrome-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627536,"mean":4.9480380313392,"rank":2905985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627536,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74616,"mean":4.2489644977551,"rank":54103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74616,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":977,"mean":1.6849139344262,"rank":615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":977,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":1.039724137931,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Environmental Science":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/cirugiaF\/status\/202345151534858240","citation_ids":[743896],"posted_on":"2012-05-15T10:30:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"202345151534858240"}]}}
