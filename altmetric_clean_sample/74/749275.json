LGR6 was found as one of the novel genes mutated in colon cancer through total exon sequencing and its promoter region is hypermethylated in 20-50% of colon cancer cases. In the skin, LGR6 marks a population of stem cells that can give rise to all cell lineages. Recently, we and others demonstrated that LGR4 and LGR5 function as receptors of R-spondins to potentiate Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling. However, the binding affinity and functional response of LGR6 to R-spondins, and the activity of colon cancer mutants of LGR6 have not been determined.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E7137G","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Xing Gong","Kendra S.
