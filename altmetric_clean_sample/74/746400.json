RJ was administered orally in a prophylactic-therapeutic (30 days before and 30 days after the transplantations of tumor cells) or a therapeutic (30 days after the transplantations of tumor cells) manner. Tumor cells were transplanted i.p. (ascites tumor) or s.c. (solid tumor). The daily dose of RJ was 0 (control), 10, 100, or 1000 mg\/kg. In the case of the therapeutic experiments employing advance leukemia L1210 and P388 strains, which gave quite a short survival period of 8 approximately 9 days, RJ did not show any antitumor effect. In the case of the therapeutic RJ application employing the Sarcoma-180 ascites tumor, which gave a moderate survival period of 16 days, the increased life span was 9.3 approximately 19.3%; and with the Ehrlich ascites tumor (survival period of 22.1 days), the increased life span was 20.4% (RJ 10 mg\/kg . day) and 17.6% (RJ 1,000 mg\/kg . day), but no antitumor effect was observed at the dose of 100 mg\/kg . day. In the case of the therapeutic experiment employing Ehrlich solid tumor, tumor growth inhibition was 25.3 approximately 54.8%, where as the use of the prophylactic-therapeutic regimen gave a tumor growth inhibition of 38.3 approximately 45.7%. In the case of the therapeutic RJ application employing Sarcoma-180 solid tumor, tumor growth inhibition was 45.1 approximately 59.7%, where as the prophylactic-therapeutic regimen gave a tumor growth inhibition of 49.1 approximately 56.1%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f610007458","authors":["Tamura, T","Fujii, A","Kuboyama, N"],"first_seen_on":"2012-05-16T14:06:03+00:00","issns":["0015-5691"],"issue":"2","journal":"Folia Pharmacologica Japonica","last_mentioned_on":1495538992,"links":["http:\/\/ukpmc.ac.uk\/abstract\/MED\/3570105","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3570105","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3570105","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3570105?dopt=Abstract&holding=f1000,f1000m,isrctn"],"pmid":"3570105","pubdate":"1987-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"[Antitumor effects of royal jelly (RJ)].","type":"article","volume":"89","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antitumor-effects-royal-jelly-rj"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":3279349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4949031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96501,"mean":5.4319467772021,"rank":30440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":65698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96501,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":334,"mean":2.5186546546547,"rank":153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":334,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":2.2786666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
