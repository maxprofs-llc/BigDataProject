A proposed mechanism of reperfusion hypotension is the massive induction of oxidative stress triggering the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO). Methylene blue (MB) is an inhibitor of inducible NO synthase and an NO scavenger that has been shown to attenuate reperfusion hypotension. Of note, recent reports have shown that the exogenous administration of NO during OLT significantly improved the recovery of the graft liver. Therefore, we sought to investigate the effects of MB on the functional recovery of the graft liver following OLT.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007cab","authors":["Fukazawa K","Pretto EA"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00534-010-0344-7","first_seen_on":"2012-05-15T19:04:53+00:00","issns":["1868-6974","1868-6982"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1336694400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21104279","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00534-010-0344-7"],"pmid":"21104279","pubdate":"2010-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"The effect of methylene blue during orthotopic liver transplantation on post reperfusion syndrome and postoperative graft function","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-methylene-blue-during-orthotopic-liver-transplantation-post-reperfusion-syndrome-postoperativ"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":2015655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":941743,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74635,"mean":4.2245928397244,"rank":32887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":28283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74635,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":0.80282857142857,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.7125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
