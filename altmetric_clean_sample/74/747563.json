Important paper #Cognitive ability in different societies + use of cognitive artefacts","what makes nations intelligent? a close look at what we need to support and build. #psychology #economics #nutrition"],"citation":{"abstract":"Modern society is driven by the use of cognitive artifacts: physical instruments or styles of reasoning that amplify our ability to think. The artifacts range from writing systems to computers. In everyday life, a person demonstrates intelligence by showing skill in using these artifacts. Intelligence tests and their surrogates force examinees to exhibit some of these skills but not others. This is why test scores correlate substantially but not perfectly with a variety of measures of socioeconomic success. The same thing is true at the international level. Nations can be evaluated by the extent to which their citizens score well on cognitive tests, including both avowed intelligence tests and a variety of tests of academic achievement. The resulting scores are substantially correlated with various indices of national wealth, health, environmental quality, and schooling and with a vaguer variable, social commitment to innovation. These environmental variables are suggested as causes of the differences in general cognitive skills between national populations. It is conceivable that differences in gene pools also contribute to international and, within nations, group differences in cognitive skills, but at present it is impossible to evaluate the extent of genetic influences.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043af","authors":["Hunt, Earl","Earl Hunt"],"doi":"10.1177\/1745691612442905","endpage":"306","first_seen_on":"2012-05-17T00:12:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1745-6924","1745-6916"],"issue":"3","journal":"Perspectives on Psychological Science (Sage Publications Inc.)","last_mentioned_on":1390312847,"links":["http:\/\/pps.sagepub.com\/content\/7\/3\/284.abstract?rss=1","http:\/\/pps.sagepub.com\/content\/7\/3\/284.abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/1745691612442905","http:\/\/pps.sagepub.com\/content\/7\/3\/284.abstract?etoc","http:\/\/m.pps.sagepub.com\/content\/7\/3\/284","http:\/\/pps.sagepub.com\/content\/7\/3\/284.full","http:\/\/pps.sagepub.com\/content\/7\/3\/284.long","http:\/\/pps.sagepub.com\/content\/7\/3\/284"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pps.sagepub.com\/content\/7\/3\/284.full.pdf","pmid":"26168467","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"284","title":"What Makes Nations Intelligent?","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/makes-nations-intelligent"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8357686,"mean":7.0472856476328,"rank":1090236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":7264986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8357686,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94978,"mean":5.5051667035177,"rank":11793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":83152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94978,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":664,"mean":46.241529411765,"rank":445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":664,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":30.662666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":10,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":10,"Scientists":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
