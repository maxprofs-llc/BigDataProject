In PC2-defective mice, cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate\/ protein kinase A (cAMP\/PKA)-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase\/ mammalian target of rapamycin (ERK-mTOR) signaling stimulates cyst growth. We investigated the mechanisms connecting PC2 dysfunction to altered Ca(2+) and cAMP production and inappropriate ERK signaling in PC2-defective cholangiocytes. Cystic cholangiocytes were isolated from PC2 conditional-KO (knockout) mice (Pkd2(flox\/-) :pCxCreER\u2122; hence, called Pkd2KO) and compared to cholangiocytes from wild-type mice (WT). Our results showed that, compared to WT cells, in PC2-defective cholangiocytes (Pkd2KO), cytoplasmic and ER-Ca(2+) (measured with Fura-2 and Mag-Fluo4) levels are decreased and store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) is inhibited, whereas the expression of Ca(2+) -sensor stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and store-operated Ca(2+) channels (e.g., the Orai1 channel) are unchanged. In Pkd2KO cells, ER-Ca(2+) depletion increases cAMP and PKA-dependent ERK1\/2 activation and both are inhibited by STIM1 inhibitors or by silencing of adenylyl cyclase type 6 (AC6).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f610007619","authors":["Spirli C","Locatelli L","Fiorotto R","Morell CM","Fabris L","Pozzan T","Strazzabosco M"],"doi":"10.1002\/hep.24723","first_seen_on":"2012-05-17T13:16:02+00:00","issns":["0270-9139"],"issue":"","journal":"Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1337259885,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21987453?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21987453","pubdate":"2011-10-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Altered store operated calcium entry increases cAMP production and ERK1\/2 phosphorylation in Polycystin-2 defective cholangiocytes.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/altered-store-operated-calcium-entry-increases-cyclic-35adenosine-monophosphate-production-extracell"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":4205079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78232,"mean":4.9269646815201,"rank":64078,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78232,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3100,"mean":4.2413797999355,"rank":2594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3100,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":2.2513888888889,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
