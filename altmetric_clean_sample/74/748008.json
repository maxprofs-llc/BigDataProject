To begin addressing the paucity of research, five qualitative focus groups (N = 53) were conducted in Australian training colleges to explore the dietary behaviors of apprentices. Thematic analysis was used by the researcher who concludes that although some apprentices were health conscious and attempted to eat healthy foods, many had diets high in saturated fats and sugar. These types of diets are associated with increased risks for developing chronic disease and are associated with decreased life expectancy. As such it poses a serious challenge for health promoters. Apprentices' dietary practices were also found to be moderated by convenience, availability, and cost of foods in their environment. Their nutritional beliefs, significant others, colleagues in the workplace, and their body image also influence their food choices.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006981","authors":["du Plessis K"],"doi":"10.1177\/1557988311417613","first_seen_on":"2012-05-17T08:08:47+00:00","issns":["1557-9883"],"issue":"","journal":"American Journal of Men's Health","last_mentioned_on":1337241619,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21862566?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21862566","pubdate":"2011-08-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","healthservices"],"title":"Factors Influencing Australian Construction Industry Apprentices' Dietary Behaviors.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factors-influencing-australian-construction-industry-apprentices-dietary-behaviors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632901,"mean":4.9227823810231,"rank":2897999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632901,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72967,"mean":4.3084583504645,"rank":52540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72967,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241,"mean":3.1146833333333,"rank":217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.275,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
