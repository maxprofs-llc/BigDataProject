Vitamin D is produced by the conversion of D3 in the skin following UVB exposure, or after ingestion of D2 or D3. At the extremes of latitude, there is insufficient UVB intensity in the autumn and winter months for adequate synthesis of vitamin D to occur. Growing evidence implicates vitamin D deficiency in early life in the pathogenesis of nonskeletal disorders (e. g., type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis) and, more recently, atopic disorders. Several studies have reported higher rates of food allergy\/anaphylaxis or proxy measures at higher absolute latitudes. Although causality remains to be determined, these studies suggest a possible role for sunlight and\/or vitamin D in the pathogenesis of food allergy\/anaphylaxis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007046","authors":["Mullins RJ","Camargo CA"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11882-011-0230-7","first_seen_on":"2012-05-16T12:02:08+00:00","issns":["1529-7322"],"issue":"","journal":"Current Allergy and Asthma Reports","last_mentioned_on":1337170314,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22006065"],"pmid":"22006065","pubdate":"2011-10-19T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Latitude, Sunlight, Vitamin D, and Childhood Food Allergy\/Anaphylaxis.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/latitude-sunlight-vitamin-d-childhood-food-allergyanaphylaxis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":1140403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3889727,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80040,"mean":4.8343137720361,"rank":16193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":63744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80040,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":386,"mean":3.0582441558442,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":386,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":3.4307692307692,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Ph.
