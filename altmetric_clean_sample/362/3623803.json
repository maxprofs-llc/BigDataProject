In anesthetized dogs, the vasodilator effect of KB-944 was not inhibited by propranolol, atropine, diphenhydramine and aminophylline, and did not potentiate the coronary vasodilator action of adenosine. In isolated dog coronary arteries, KB-944 as well as verapamil inhibited the potassium-induced contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory effects of KB-944 and verapamil were overcome by elevating the calcium concentration of the bath solution and a competitive antagonism was found between calcium ions and both compounds. In isolated rabbit aorta, KB-944 (10(-5)--10(-7) mol\/l) inhibited potassium-induced contraction in a dose-dependent manner, though KB-944 (3 x 10(-5)--3 x 10(-4) mol\/l) slightly inhibited noradrenaline(norepinephrine)-induced contractions. In isolated taenia caecum, KB-944, diltiazem and nifedipine produced a shift to the right of dose-response curves for calcium in a competitive fashion, the pA2 values being 6.84 for KB-944, 6.96 for diltiazem and 9.80 for nifedipine. From these results, it would be that interference with calcium influx contributes to the vasodilator activity of KB-944.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b38","authors":["T Morita","T Kanazawa","K Ito","T Nose"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T15:32:15+00:00","issns":["0004-4172"],"issue":"9","journal":"Arzneimittelforschung = Drug Research","last_mentioned_on":1271056928,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6890823"],"pmid":"6890823","pubdate":"1982-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Vasodilator mechanism of KB-944, a new calcium antagonist.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vasodilator-mechanism-kb944-new-calcium-antagonist"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633255,"mean":4.9221505741186,"rank":815884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633255,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96763,"mean":8.2607898761913,"rank":25366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96763,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266,"mean":2.4912679245283,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Fostedil","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=355494520#altmetric_citation_3","license":"public","citation_ids":[3623803],"posted_on":"2010-04-12T07:22:08+00:00","summary":"Fostedil (A-53,986, KB-944) is a vasodilator acting as a calcium channel blocker which was under development for the treatment of heart conditions such as angina pectoris but was never marketed.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=26914665","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Vanished 45kd09la13","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Vanished 45kd09la13"}}]}}
