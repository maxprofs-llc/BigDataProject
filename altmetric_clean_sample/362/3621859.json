Worldwide, multiple sclerosis affects 2.5 million individuals. Multiple sclerosis affects two to three times as many women as men. The adverse effects of hyperthermia in patients with multiple sclerosis have been known since 1890. While most patients with multiple sclerosis experience reversible worsening of their neurologic deficits, some patients experience irreversible neurologic deficits. In fact, heat-induced fatalities have been encountered in multiple sclerosis patients subjected to hyperthermia. Hyperthermia can be caused through sun exposure, exercise, and infection. During the last 50 years, numerous strategies have evolved to reduce hyperthermia in individuals with multiple sclerosis, such as photoprotective clothing, sunglasses, sunscreens, hydrotherapy, and prevention of urinary tract infections. Hydrotherapy has become an essential component of rehabilitation for multiple sclerosis patients in hospitals throughout the world. On the basis of this positive hospital experience, hydrotherapy has been expanded through the use of compact aquatic exercise pools at home along with personal cooling devices that promote local and systemic hypothermia in multiple sclerosis patients. The Multiple Sclerosis Association of America and NASA have played leadership roles in developing and recommending technology that will prevent hyperthermia in multiple sclerosis patients and should be consulted for new technological advances that will benefit the multiple sclerosis patient. In addition, products recommended for photoprotection by The Skin Cancer Foundation may also be helpful to the multiple sclerosis patient's defense against hyperthermia. Infections in the urinary tract, especially detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia, are initially managed conservatively with intermittent self-catheterization and pharmacologic therapy. In those cases, refractory to conservative therapy, transurethral external sphincterotomy followed by condom catheter drainage is recommended. However, if external urethral sphincterotomy fails to reduce residual urine and detrusor pressure, urinary diversion or bladder reconstruction may be necessary.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007d22","authors":["Edlich RF","Buschbacher RM","Cox MJ","Long WB","Winters KL","Becker DG"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T14:32:13+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Long-Term Effects of Medical Implants","last_mentioned_on":1279751048,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15698375"],"pmid":"15698375","pubdate":"2005-02-09T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Engineering","Dentistry","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Strategies to reduce hyperthermia in ambulatory multiple sclerosis patients.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/strategies-reduce-hyperthermia-ambulatory-multiple-sclerosis-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616992,"mean":4.9289391557822,"rank":815297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2278012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616992,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93965,"mean":7.2301354348474,"rank":23895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93965,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":2.0764705882353,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
