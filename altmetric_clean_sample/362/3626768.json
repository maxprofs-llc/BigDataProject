Particularly in higher organisms, transcription factors (TFs), microRNAs and epigenetic modifications can combine to form a complex regulatory network. Part of this system can be modeled as a collection of regulatory modules: co-regulated genes, the conditions under which they are co-regulated and sequence-level regulatory motifs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d2","authors":["Curtis Huttenhower","K.
