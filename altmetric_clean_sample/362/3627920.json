But, is the MRSA problem--by its size--blinding us to something ultimately more dangerous: the slow emergence of gram-negative pathogens (which stain pink) with resistance to all reliable antibiotics? Although presently rare, 'pan-resistant' gram-negative bacteria--predominantly strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii--have more comprehensive resistance than any gram-positive pathogen. They already pose treatment problems in compromised hospital patients, especially in specialist units, as well in particular groups, such as cystic fibrosis patents. Disturbingly, there is a near-total lack of developmental antibiotics active against gram-negative pathogens.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a27","authors":["David M Livermore"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T17:39:33+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0785-3890"],"issue":"4","journal":"Annals of Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1294007825,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12846264"],"pmid":"12846264","pubdate":"2003-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The threat from the pink corner.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/threat-pink-corner"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":816868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95986,"mean":8.1949825701934,"rank":25024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95986,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263,"mean":4.4259083969466,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":19.88,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":3,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":11,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Environmental Science":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1,"PL":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Social history of viruses","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=405573915#altmetric_citation_125","license":"public","citation_ids":[3627917,3627920],"posted_on":"2011-01-02T22:37:05+00:00","summary":"The social history of viruses describes the influence of viruses and viral infections on human history.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=29802394","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Graham Beards","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Graham Beards"}}]}}
