Recent technical advances have made possible the continuous collection of successive images at a rate rapid compared with such signal changes and in the statistical processing of these image time series to produce tomographic maps of brain activity in real time, with updates of 10 frames\/s or better. We describe here our preferred method of real-time functional MRI and some of the early results we have obtained with its use.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037b7","authors":["M S Cohen"],"doi":"10.1006\/meth.2001.1235","first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T15:42:06+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1046-2023"],"issue":"2","journal":"Methods","last_mentioned_on":1315617899,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11812206"],"pmid":"11812206","pubdate":"2001-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/realtime-functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging-21"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627464,"mean":4.9483847763613,"rank":817642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627464,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95664,"mean":8.1384224621851,"rank":24887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95664,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":498,"mean":2.2551710261569,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":498,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.4125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Physics and Astronomy":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Real-time MRI","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=449423755#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[434813,3624173],"posted_on":"2011-09-10T01:24:59+00:00","summary":"Real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) refers to the continuous monitoring (&quot;filming&quot;) of moving objects in real time.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=28687367","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"MarkSCohen","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:MarkSCohen"}}]}}
