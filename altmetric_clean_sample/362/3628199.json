Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-bound poly-L-leucine acts as a THF-soluble catalyst for the Juli\u00e1-Colonna asymmetric epoxidation of enones. Excellent enantioselectivities may be obtained even with short chain length polyleucine. FT-IR investigations have determined that the catalytically active polyleucine components of these copolymers have an alpha-helical structure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Robert W.
