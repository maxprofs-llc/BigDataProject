Here, we report that miR-223 is largely suppressed in cells from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. By sequencing, we found that miR-223 suppression in AML is not caused by DNA sequence alterations, nor is it mediated by promoter hypermethylation. The analysis of the individual contribution of both CEBPA sites to miR-223 regulation identified the site upstream of the miR-223 primary transcript as the predominant regulatory element. Our results suggest that miR-223 suppression in AML is caused by impaired miR-223 upstream factors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fa3cf058f610003009","doi":"10.1016\/j.leukres.2009.11.019","first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T16:51:41+00:00","issns":["0145-2126"],"journal":"Leukemia Research","last_mentioned_on":1288701590,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.leukres.2009.11.019","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20018373"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.lrjournal.com\/article\/S0145212609005414\/pdf","pmid":"20018373","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Complexity of miR-223 regulation by CEBPA in human AML.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complexity-mir223-regulation-cebpa-human-aml"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627218,"mean":4.9497513377373,"rank":817736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627218,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95588,"mean":8.1279177293984,"rank":24854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95588,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320,"mean":1.4914169278997,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.0555555555556,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
