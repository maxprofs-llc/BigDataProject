A distinctive feature of the neoplasm was prominent neuroendocrine differentiation, including single, discrete neuroendocrine cells; aggregates of neuroendocrine cells resembling miniature carcinoid tumors; and a single focus of undifferentiated small cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining of neuroendocrine cells revealed the presence of neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin, somatostatin, insulin, and serotonin. The heterogeneous cell populations caused problems in differential diagnosis and histologic classification. This case demonstrates that fetal adenocarcinoma may occur as a central endobronchial mass and express a variable degree of neuroendocrine differentiation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002494","authors":["G Mardini","U Pai","A M Chavez","J F Tomashefski"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T14:09:32+00:00","issns":["0008-543X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Cancer (0008543X)","last_mentioned_on":1334410243,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8111705"],"pmid":"8111705","pubdate":"1994-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Endobronchial adenocarcinoma with endometrioid features and prominent neuroendocrine differentiation.
