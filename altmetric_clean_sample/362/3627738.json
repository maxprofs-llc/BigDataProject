[Subjects and Methods] Sixteen obese volunteers were randomly assigned into yoga and control groups. The yoga training program was performed for 45 minutes per day, 3 times per week, for 4 weeks. Static and dynamic balance were assessed in volunteers with one leg standing and functional reach tests. Outcome measures were tested before training and after a single week of training. Two-way repeated measure analysis of variance with Tukey's honestly significant difference post hoc statistics was used to analyze the data. [Results] Obese individuals showed significantly increased static standing balance in the yoga training group, but there was no significant improvement of static or dynamic standing balance in the control group after 4 weeks. In the yoga group, significant increases in static standing balance was found after the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th weeks. Compared with the control group, static standing balance in the yoga group was significantly different after the 2nd week, and dynamic standing balance was significantly different after the 4th week. [Conclusion] Yoga training would be beneficial for improving standing balance in obese individuals with poor standing balance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a8f","authors":["Chaiyong Jorrakate","Jutaluk Kongsuk","Chiraprapa Pongduang","Boontiwa Sadsee","Phatchari Chanthorn"],"doi":"10.1589\/jpts.27.59","first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T17:33:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0915-5287","2187-5626"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Physical Therapy Science","last_mentioned_on":1490025751,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4305598\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25642038","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25642038"],"pmcid":"PMC4305598","pmid":"25642038","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society of Physical Therapy Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"59","title":"Effect of yoga training on one leg standing and functional reach tests in obese individuals with poor postural control","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/jpts\/27\/1\/27_jpts-2014-280\/_article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-yoga-training-one-leg-standing-functional-reach-tests-obese-individuals-poor-postural-control"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.75,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":556692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7831631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246846,"mean":8.4448366545808,"rank":21279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":225511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246846,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":970,"mean":3.2698906088751,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":970,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":3.4395918367347,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
