His psychomotor inhibition, depressive mood, sleep disturbances, general fatigue, muscular pain, and arthralgia were considered to be due to intense work in a stressful environment. Neither his physician nor his orthopedist found any physical disease. Therefore, he was diagnosed with endogenous depression by a psychiatric clinic, and antidepressants were prescribed. Antidepressants were not sufficient for improving his symptoms, and he was admitted to our hospital. Endocrine blood examination revealed primary adrenocortical insufficiency. Treatment with glucocorticoid induced rapid improvement in both the psychiatric and physical symptoms. It is well known that psychiatric symptoms occur in the progressive stage of Addison's disease. At present, however, the occurrence of psychiatric symptoms is very rare, mainly because of a decrease in the incidence of this disease or an increase in mild cases. In addition, Addison's disease presenting with psychiatric features in the early stage has the tendency to be overlooked and misdiagnosed. Thus, we suggest the necessity of blood work for ACTH and cortisol in the field of psychiatry.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000cf7e","authors":["Iwata M","Hazama GI","Shirayama Y","Ueta T","Yoshioka S","Kawahara R"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T14:37:03+00:00","issns":["0033-2658"],"issue":"9","journal":"Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica","last_mentioned_on":1506111454,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15580869","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15580869"],"pmid":"15580869","pubdate":"2004-12-09T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"[A case of Addison's disease presented with depression as a first symptom].","type":"article","volume":"106","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/case-addisons-disease-presented-depression-first-symptom"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":3,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451303,"mean":7.1041024516615,"rank":2174030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5125590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451303,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247171,"mean":8.4597361411175,"rank":72152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":168968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247171,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":1.4516034482759,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.71875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Depression (differential diagnoses)","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=413961610#altmetric_citation_55","license":"public","citation_ids":[3622021],"posted_on":"2011-02-14T22:51:24+00:00","summary":"Depression - one of the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorders - is being diagnosed in increasing numbers in various segments of the population worldwide.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=27982883","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Rjwilmsi","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Rjwilmsi"}},{"title":"Depression (differential diagnoses)","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=801924887#altmetric_citation_59aa0d51-0ae1-46e7-8bb8-34875a1d3ecc","license":"public","citation_ids":[3622021],"posted_on":"2017-09-22T20:17:34+00:00","summary":"Depression, one of the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorders, is being diagnosed in increasing numbers in various segments of the population worldwide.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=27982883","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"167.91.2.226","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/167.91.2.226"}}]}}
