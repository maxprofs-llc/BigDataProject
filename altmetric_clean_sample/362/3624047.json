The pyrazolopyridines tracazolate, cartazolate and etazolate were several fold more potent than theophylline at both A1- and A2-adenosine receptors. The pyrazolopyridines, however, were still many fold less potent than 8-phenyltheophylline and other 8-phenyl-1,3-dialkylxanthines. A structurally related N6-substituted 9-methyladenine was also a potent adenosine antagonist with selectivity for A1 receptors. None of several aryl-substituted heterocycles, including a thiazolopyrimidine, imidazopyridines, benzimidazoles, a pyrazoloquinoline, a mesoionic xanthine analog and a triazolopyridazine exhibited the high potency typical of 8-phenyl-1,3-dialkylxanthines. A furyl-substituted triazoloquinazoline was very potent at both A1 and A2 receptors. A pteridin-2,4-dione, 1,3-dipropyllumazine, was somewhat less potent than theophylline at A1- and A2-adenosine receptors, whereas 1,3-dimethyllumazine was much less potent. A benzopteridin-2,4-dione, alloxazine, was somewhat more potent than theophylline. Other heterocycles with antagonist activity were the dibenzazepine carbamazepine and beta-carboline-3-ethyl carboxylate. The phenylimidazoline clonidine had no activity, whereas a related dihydroxyphenylimidazoline was a weak non-competitive adenosine antagonist.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c2","authors":["J W Daly","O Hong","W L Padgett","M T Shamim","K A Jacobson","D Ukena"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T15:38:18+00:00","issns":["0006-2952"],"issue":"4","journal":"Biochemical Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1283217586,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2829919","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3445624"],"pmcid":"PMC3445624","pmid":"2829919","pubdate":"1988-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"NON-XANTHINE HETEROCYCLES: ACTIVITY AS ANTAGONISTS OF A1- AND A2-ADENOSINE RECEPTORS","type":"article","volume":"37"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626596,"mean":4.9527436744422,"rank":817873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626596,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95447,"mean":8.1224660855353,"rank":24787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95447,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1107,"mean":4.969486437613,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":517,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1107,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.6678571428571,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Cartazolate","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=381987350#altmetric_citation_4","license":"public","citation_ids":[3624046,3624047],"posted_on":"2010-08-31T01:19:46+00:00","summary":"Cartazolate (SQ-65,396) is a drug of the pyrazolopyridine class.
