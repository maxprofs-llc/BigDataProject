By use of open-flow microperfusion, four macroscopically perforated double lumen catheters were inserted into the tissue regions of interest and constantly perfused. Across the macroscopic perforations of the catheters interstitial fluid was partially recovered in the perfusion fluid. Catheters were perfused with five solutions, each containing different concentrations of albumin. Absolute interstitial albumin concentrations were calculated by applying linear regression analysis to perfusate vs. sampled albumin concentration (no-net-flux calibration technique). Interstitial albumin concentrations were significantly lower (P < 0.0001) in adipose tissue (7.36 g\/l; r = 0.99, P < 0.0003; range: 4.3-10.7 g\/l) and in skeletal muscle (13.25 g\/l; r = 0.99, P < 0.0012; range: 9.7 to 15.7 g\/l) compared with the serum concentration (48.9 +\/- 0.7 g\/l, mean +\/- SE, n = 6; range: 46.4-50.4 g\/l). Furthermore, interstitial albumin concentrations were significantly higher in skeletal muscle compared with adipose tissue (P < 0.01). The study indicates that open-flow microperfusion allows stable sampling of macromolecules from the interstitial space of peripheral tissue compartments. Moreover, the present data report for the first time in healthy humans in vivo the true albumin concentrations of interstitial fluid of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000220e","authors":["M Ellmerer","L Schaupp","G A Brunner","G Sendlhofer","A Wutte","P Wach","T R Pieber"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T14:18:45+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0193-1849"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal of Physiology: Endocrinology & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1423893060,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10662720"],"pmid":"10662720","pubdate":"2000-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","physiology","endocrinology"],"title":"Measurement of interstitial albumin in human skeletal muscle and adipose tissue by open-flow microperfusion.","type":"article","volume":"278","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measurement-interstitial-albumin-human-skeletal-muscle-adipose-tissue-openflow-microperfusion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.208,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.208},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4757505,"mean":5.7082384397391,"rank":718673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":4038718,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4757505,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172104,"mean":8.8569031684517,"rank":34434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":137670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172104,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1096,"mean":6.4228931506849,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1096,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":10.4875,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Ph.
