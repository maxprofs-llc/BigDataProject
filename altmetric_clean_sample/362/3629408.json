It was found that observable changes in oral behavior do occur after mandibular osteotomy. Fewer errors were found in sibilant articulation, while more maladaptive lingual behaviors were found in lingual diadochokinetic tasks. Changes were also found in swallowing behaviors. Performance tasks of speech, diadochokinetics, and swallowing were recorded on audio-videotape.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa91d3cf058f61000d401","authors":["L Glass","J Knapp","H H Bloomer"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T18:25:56+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0022-3255"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of oral surgery","last_mentioned_on":1296233144,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/264502"],"pmid":"264502","pubdate":"1977-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Speech and lingual behavior before and after mandibular osteotomy.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/speech-lingual-behavior-before-after-mandibular-osteotomy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635050,"mean":4.9227315329755,"rank":816728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635050,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97128,"mean":8.2815760190267,"rank":25558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97128,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.90625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Lillian Glass","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=410586889#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3629408],"posted_on":"2011-01-28T16:45:44+00:00","summary":"Lillian Glass is an American communication and body language expert, media commentator, jury\/ litigation consultant, mediator and author.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=30362390","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Citation bot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Citation bot"}}]}}
