In all cases, the 3'-end nucleotide of the individual mRNA coding sequences has been found to be immediately contiguous to a tRNA gene or another mRNA coding sequence. These and previous results indicate that the heavy (H) strand sequences coding for the rRNA, poly(A)-containing RNA and tRNA species form a continuum extending over almost the entire length of this strand. We propose that the H strand is transcribed into a single polycistronic RNA molecule, which is processed later into mature species by precise endonucleolytic cleavages which occur, in most cases, immediately before and after a tRNA sequence.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["D Ojala","J Montoya","G Attardi"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T14:56:11+00:00","issns":["0028-0836"],"issue":"5806","journal":"Nature","last_mentioned_on":1280394135,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7219536"],"pmid":"7219536","pubdate":"1981-04-09T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"tRNA punctuation model of RNA processing in human mitochondria.","type":"article","volume":"290","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trna-punctuation-model-rna-processing-human-mitochondria"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629910,"mean":4.9315517540573,"rank":816264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629910,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96225,"mean":8.2160558280681,"rank":25124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96225,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34745,"mean":41.297471736127,"rank":22260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":7522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34745,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":747,"mean":137.22807238606,"rank":716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":747,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":12,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":30,"Student  > Ph.
