In the current study, nine strains (Y10, Y5, Y21, Y2, Y19, Y16, Y3, Y13 and Y4) of non-Saccharomyces were isolated from Cabernet Sauvignon grape wine. Aromatic components from Cabernet sauvignon-fermented wine were determined the phylogenetic evolution status of different non-Saccharomyces based on 26S rDNA and D1\/D2 sequence analysis and analysed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, and they were grouped into one category with four different yeast genus which were Meyerozyma guilliermondii, Brettanomyces naardenensis, Pichia guilliermondi and Candida fermentati. A total of 102 kinds of aroma components were detected, including 39 kinds of esters, 31 kinds of alcohols, 8 kinds of ketones, 10 kinds of alkanes, 15 kinds of acids and 4 kinds of other aroma substances.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d63cf058f6100010b5","authors":["Xuewei Shi","Fusheng Chen","Ya'nan Xu","Xiaoji Zheng","Jing Xiao"],"doi":"10.1080\/14786419.2015.1008475","first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T18:17:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1478-6427"],"journal":"Natural Product Research","last_mentioned_on":1423921690,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25677508?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25677508","pubdate":"2015-02-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Aromatic components produced by non-Saccharomyces Cerevisiae derived from natural fermentation of grape.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aromatic-components-produced-nonsaccharomyces-cerevisiae-derived-natural-fermentation-grape"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4757505,"mean":5.7082384397391,"rank":3981151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4757505,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172104,"mean":8.8569075263072,"rank":139117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172104,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":487,"mean":1.230024691358,"rank":288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":487,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":0.997,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
