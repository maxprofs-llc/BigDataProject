Despite this seemingly low prevalence, it remains a diagnostic and therapeutic conundrum that has resulted in numerous attempts to adopt novel strategies in managing this disease. Anecdotally, there has been a prevailing notion that established gold standard systemic regimens should be substituted for those utilised in cancers such as gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies; tumours that share more biological similarities than other EOC subtypes. This review summarises the plethora of small studies which have adopted this philosophy and influenced the design of the multinational GOG142 study, which was ultimately terminated due to poor accrual. To date, there is a paucity of evidence to support delivering 'GI style' chemotherapy for mucinous ovarian cancer over and above carboplatin-paclitaxel doublet therapy. Hence there is an urge to develop studies focused on targeted therapeutic agents driven by refined mutational analysis and conducted within the context of harmonised international collaborations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002643","authors":["Xu, Wen","Rush, Jack","Rickett, Kirsty","Coward, Jermaine I G"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.critrevonc.2016.03.015","endpage":"36","first_seen_on":"2016-05-15T21:44:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0461","10408428"],"journal":"Critical Reviews in Oncology\/Hematology","last_mentioned_on":1463319667,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1040842816300567?_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_docanchor&md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb"],"pmid":"27083591","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"26","subjects":["neoplasms","hematology"],"title":"Mucinous ovarian cancer: A therapeutic review","type":"article","volume":"102","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mucinous-ovarian-cancer-therapeutic-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7700406,"mean":6.6097173252523,"rank":6661580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7700406,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269531,"mean":11.452422832337,"rank":225055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269531,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":485,"mean":3.7002892561983,"rank":409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":485,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":2.8518518518519,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
