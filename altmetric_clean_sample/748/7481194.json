Global threats to child safety exist. These threats include lack of basic needs (food, clean water, sanitation), maltreatment, abandonment, child labor, child marriage, female genital mutilation, child trafficking, disasters, and armed conflicts\/wars. Recent disasters and armed conflicts have led to a record number of displaced people especially children and their families. Strategies and specific programs can be developed and implemented for eliminating threats to the safety of children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c15","authors":["Mace, Sharon E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pcl.2015.09.003","endpage":"35","first_seen_on":"2016-05-15T18:46:27+00:00","issns":["1557-8240","00313955"],"issue":"1","journal":"Pediatric clinics of North America","last_mentioned_on":1463305529,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0031395515001522"],"pmid":"26613687","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"19","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Global Threats to Child Safety","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/global-threats-child-safety"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7700406,"mean":6.6097173252523,"rank":3988944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2164491,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7700406,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269532,"mean":11.452448423372,"rank":146397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96756,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269532,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":613,"mean":3.0735882352941,"rank":359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":613,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.6,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
