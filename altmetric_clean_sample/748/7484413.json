Andrographolide (Andro) is a potential cancer therapeutic agent isolated from Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Nees (Acanthaceae).\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of PTX combined with Andro against A549 cells.\nThe effects of 24-48\u2009h treatment with 0.48-60.75\u2009nM PTX and 5.10-328.0\u2009\u03bcM Andro on cellular proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by sulphorhodamine B assay, Annexin V-FITC\/PI apoptosis detection, PI staining and ROS assay, respectively. Synergy was determined using combination index. The antitumour efficacy of 20\u2009mg\/kg PTX with 100\u2009mg\/kg Andro was studied in a xenograft murine model.\nIC50 value of the PTX combined with Andro against A549 cells was 0.5-7.4\u2009nM, which was significantly lower than that of PTX (15.9\u2009nM). PTX with 10\u2009\u03bcM Andro caused (1.22-1.27)-fold apoptosis and 1.7-fold ROS accumulation compared with PTX alone. N-Acetylcysteine, a ROS scavenger, blocked this synergy in vitro. In contrast, G2\/M phase cell cycle arrest resulting from PTX was not potentiated by Andro. Moreover, PTX in combination with Andro inhibited the growth of A549 transplanted tumours by 98%.\nThe results indicate that the combination of PTX and Andro exert significant synergistic anticancer effect on A549 cells in vitro and in vivo. The synergy may be the result of the accumulation of ROS. The combination of Andro and PTX represents a potential strategy for the treatment of A549 cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043bb","authors":["Yuan, Huihui","Sun, Bo","Gao, Feng","Lan, Minbo"],"doi":"10.1080\/13880209.2016.1176056","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2016-05-15T23:59:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-5116","1388-0209"],"journal":"Pharmaceutical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1463289547,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/13880209.2016.1176056"],"pmid":"27159496","pubdate":"2016-05-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["pharmacy","pharmacology"],"title":"Synergistic anticancer effects of andrographolide and paclitaxel against A549 NSCLC cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synergistic-anticancer-effects-andrographolide-paclitaxel-against-a549-nsclc-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7700406,"mean":6.6097173252523,"rank":6661585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7700406,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269531,"mean":11.452492397877,"rank":225053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269531,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":578,"mean":1.7748665511265,"rank":382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":578,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":0.79833333333333,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
