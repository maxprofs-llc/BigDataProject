In this report, we studied the effects of AuNPs with diameters of 3, 13, and 45\u00a0nm, respectively, on rabbit articular chondrocytes. AuNPs were capped with citrate and their diameter and zeta potential were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Cell viability was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay after the rabbit articular chondrocytes were pre-incubated with 3, 13, and 45\u00a0nm AuNPs, respectively, for 24\u00a0h. Flow cytometry (FCM) analysis with annexin V\/propidium iodide (PI) double staining and fluorescence imaging with Hoechst 33258 staining were used to determine the fashion of AuNPs-induced chondrocyte death. Further, 13\u00a0nm AuNPs (2 nM) significantly induced chondrocyte death accompanying apoptotic characteristics including mitochondrial damage, externalization of phosphatidylserine and nuclear concentration. However, 3\u00a0nm AuNPs (2 nM) and 45\u00a0nm (0.02 nM) AuNPs did not induce cytotoxicity in chondrocytes. Although 13\u00a0nm AuNPs (2 nM) increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, pretreatment with Nacetyl cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, did not prevent the cytotoxicity induced by 13\u00a0nm AuNPs, indicating that 13\u00a0nm AuNPs (2 nM) induced ROS-independent apoptosis in chondrocytes. These results demonstrate the size-dependent cytotoxicity of AuNPs in chondrocytes, which must be seriously considered when using AuNPs for treatment of osteoarthritis (OA).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000877","authors":["Huang, Hao","Quan, Ying-Yao","Wang, Xiao-Ping","Chen, Tong-Sheng","Hao Huang","Ying-yao Quan","Xiao-ping Wang","Tong-sheng Chen"],"doi":"10.1186\/s11671-016-1461-2","first_seen_on":"2016-05-15T19:32:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1931-7573","1556-276X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Nanoscale Research Letters","last_mentioned_on":1475010721,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27178054?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/nanoscalereslett.springeropen.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s11671-016-1461-2","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s11671-016-1461-2"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/nanoscalereslett.springeropen.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s11671-016-1461-2?site=nanoscalereslett.springeropen.com","pmid":"27178054","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Material Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Molecular Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanochemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanoscale Science and Technology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanotechnology and Microengineering","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Condensed Matter Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"title":"Gold Nanoparticles of Diameter 13\u00a0nm Induce Apoptosis in Rabbit Articular Chondrocytes","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gold-nanoparticles-diameter-13nm-induce-apoptosis-rabbit-articular-chondrocytes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":4262628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3959478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274609,"mean":11.647315431451,"rank":136996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":126719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274609,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":592,"mean":1.6000642978003,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":592,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.4716363636364,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
