The model tracks changes in cell volume, DNA replication, and cell division, and dynamically adjusts rates of stochastic reactions based on this information. By tracking cell division, the model can maintain cell lineage information, allowing the researcher to trace the descendants of any single cell and therefore study cell lineage effects. To test the predictive power of our model, we applied it to the canonical galactose network of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a minimal set of free parameters and across several galactose induction conditions, the model effectively captured several details of the experimentally-obtained single-cell network activity levels as well as phenotypic switching rates.\nOur model can readily be customized to model any gene network in any of the commonly used cells types, offering a novel and user-friendly stochastic modeling capability to the systems biology field.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007db","authors":["Song, Ruijie","Peng, Weilin","Liu, Ping","Acar, Murat"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12918-015-0240-5","first_seen_on":"2015-12-10T11:30:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1752-0509"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Systems Biology","last_mentioned_on":1449989935,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26646617?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12918-015-0240-5","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1752-0509\/9\/91","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/s12918-015-0240-5"],"pmcid":"PMC4673848","pmid":"26646617","pubdate":"2015-12-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Algorithms","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computational Biology\/Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Physiological, Cellular and Medical Topics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Simulation and Modeling","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Systems Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Mathematics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"A cell size- and cell cycle-aware stochastic model for predicting time-dynamic gene network activity in individual cells","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cell-size-cell-cycleaware-stochastic-model-predicting-timedynamic-gene-network-activity-individual-c-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6743544,"mean":6.1672983391654,"rank":2828864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3760325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6743544,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283501,"mean":8.6467763104056,"rank":117818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":156426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283501,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":789,"mean":3.1780355329949,"rank":334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":789,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":2.8409090909091,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
