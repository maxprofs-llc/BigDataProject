If not treated in time, AMS can worsen and leads to high altitude cerebral edema, which can be fatal. Present study explores the efficacy of ethyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (EDHB), a prolyl hydroxylase enzyme inhibitor, in modulating adaptive responses to hypobaric hypoxia (HH) in rat brain. Male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with EDHB (75\u00a0mg\/kg for 3\u00a0days), were subjected to acute HH exposure at 9144\u00a0m (30,000\u00a0ft) for 5\u00a0h. Animals were assessed for transvascular leakage and edema formation in brain and role of key inflammatory markers along with hypoxia responsive genes. HH stress increased transvascular permeability and edema formation in conjunction with upregulation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and its regulated proteins. There was surge in pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6, interferon-\u03b3, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and decrement in anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10. Further, upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a vascular permeability marker and down-regulation of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory proteins hemoxygenase (HO-1) and metallothionein (MT-1) was also observed under hypoxia. EDHB supplementation effectively scaled down HH induced cerebral edema with concomitant downregulation of brain NF-\u03baB expression. There was significant curtailment of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. There was significant downregulation of permeability factor VEGF by EDHB with concomitant increment in hypoxia inducible factor (HIF1\u03b1) and anti-inflammatory proteins HO-1 and MT-1 compared to HH control thus accentuating the potential of EDHB as effective hypoxic preconditioning agent in ameliorating HH mediated injury in brain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007df2","authors":["Singh, Deependra Pratap","Nimker, Charu","Paliwal, Piyush","Bansal, Anju","Deependra Pratap Singh","Charu Nimker","Piyush Paliwal","Anju Bansal"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12576-015-0429-9","endpage":"326","first_seen_on":"2015-12-10T16:04:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1880-6562"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Physiological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1465354673,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26649730?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s12576-015-0429-9"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12576-015-0429-9.pdf","pmid":"26649730","pubdate":"2015-12-10T22:00:34+00:00","publisher":"Springer Japan","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Biochemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Animal Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"315","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Ethyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (EDHB): a prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor attenuates acute hypobaric hypoxia mediated vascular leakage in brain.","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ethyl-34dihydroxybenzoate-edhb-prolyl-hydroxylase-inhibitor-attenuates-acute-hypobaric-hypoxia-media"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7871308,"mean":6.6666994406334,"rank":5969636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1054934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7871308,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":297949,"mean":8.8721523688695,"rank":205001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":50492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":297949,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152,"mean":3.0112317880795,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":3.3947368421053,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
