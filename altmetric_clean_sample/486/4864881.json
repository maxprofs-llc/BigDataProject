Among them, 73 patients were assessable for response. The treatment was well tolerated. The main hematological adverse event was neutropenia. A total of 12 patients (15.4%) had grade 3 or grade 4 neutropenia. Grade 3 anemia was observed in six patients (7.7%) and no grade 3\/4 thrombocytopenia was observed. No Grade 3\/4 non-hematological toxicity was observed. There were five complete response (6.8%), 43 partial responses (58.9%), and the overall response rate was 65.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48.7%-81.2%). With a median follow-up period of 18.6 months, the median time to progression was 7.9 months (95% CI, 4.2-10.8 months), median overall survival was 15.7 months (95% CI, 11.6-18.5 months).\nDocetaxel combined with nedaplatin offers a satisfactory clinical activity and an acceptable safety profile as first-line chemotherapy for patients with recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbff","authors":["Pei-Jian Peng","Bao-Jun Lv","Con Tang","Hai Liao","Zhong Lin","Yu-Meng Liu","Zhi-Hui Wang","Si-Yang Wang","Zhi-Bin Chen"],"doi":"10.2147\/dddt.s95946","first_seen_on":"2015-12-11T10:16:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1177-8881"],"journal":"Drug Design, Development and Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1450395924,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/phase-ii-trial-of-docetaxel-combined-with-nedaplatin-for-patients-with-peer-reviewed-article-DDDT","https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=24921"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=28317","pmcid":"PMC4677648","pmid":"26677316","pubdate":"2015-12-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Phase II trial of docetaxel combined with nedaplatin for patients with recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phase-ii-trial-docetaxel-combined-nedaplatin-patients-recurrent-metastatic-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6787729,"mean":6.1724472011828,"rank":3286129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2001567,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6787729,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285625,"mean":8.6464914012827,"rank":144890,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":110077,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285625,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":916,"mean":3.0978972677596,"rank":335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":916,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":2.7263440860215,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DoveTherapeutic\/statuses\/675120202976247808","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4864881],"posted_on":"2015-12-11T01:09:34+00:00","author":{"name":"DovePressTherapeutic","url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/browse_journals.php?pa=view&cat_id=24","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/294900345\/DoveLogoBlock-75_normal.jpg","description":"Latest articles covering all aspects of drug development, testing and applications, published in Dove Press open access medical and scientific journals","id_on_source":"DoveTherapeutic","tweeter_id":"53283807","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":34},"tweet_id":"675120202976247808"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/professororg\/statuses\/676711176940613632","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4864881],"posted_on":"2015-12-15T10:31:31+00:00","author":{"name":"DrOmprakash Nautiyal","url":"http:\/\/www.opnautiyal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3097730175\/666d9fca2ae83078ead9440b7a2fcbc3_normal.jpeg","description":"I am Professor of Organic chemistry. 5 patents, 9 intl. confs. and 32 res pub, 2 Books and 7 chapters  to credit.
