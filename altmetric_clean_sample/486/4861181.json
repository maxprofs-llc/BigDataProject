The aliphatic isothiocyanate was used as reagent leading to substitution on NH atom of 3-aminotriazole ring, whereas the triazole amino group was substituted when isothiocyanate group was bonded to the Csp2 hybridized atom, e.g. an aryl or C=O fragment. All compounds were evaluated in vitro for the antimicrobial activity. The derivatives 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 12 showed the highest inhibition against Gram-positive cocci (S. aureus and S. epidermidis). The observed MIC values were in the range of 4-32 \u03bcg\/mL. Compounds were also tested for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against the hospital methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus. The observed MIC values varied from 4 to 64 \u03bcg\/mL. The products 4 and 10 effectively inhibited the formation of biofilms of the methicillin-resistant and standard strains of S. epidermidis. The compound 10 was found to be more promising with IC50 values of 2-6 \u03bcg\/mL as compared to the control. Moreover, the cytotoxicity against the MT-4 cells of all studied thioureas was evaluated. The compound 18 was significantly cytotoxic (CC50 = 8 \u03bcM).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008141","authors":["Stefanska, Joanna","Stepien, Karolina","Bielenica, Anna","Szulczyk, Daniel","Miroslaw, Barbara","E Koziol, Anna","Sanna, Giuseppina","Iuliano, Filippo","Madeddu, Silvia","Jozwiak, Michal","Struga, Marta"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-10T11:13:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1875-6638"],"journal":"Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1499337909,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26648331?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26648331?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26648331","pubdate":"2015-12-10T22:01:04+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Antimicrobial and Anti-Biofilm Activity of Thiourea Derivatives Bearing 3-Amino-1H-1, 2, 4-Triazole Scaffold.","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8201580,"mean":6.9400594312327,"rank":4117279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3875353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8201580,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302001,"mean":8.9964795231786,"rank":142403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":147687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302001,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113,"mean":2.4024821428571,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.2,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":4}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/biofilmPapers\/statuses\/674907547707375616","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4861181],"posted_on":"2015-12-10T11:04:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Biofilm Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585213267288653824\/evf5BSKg_normal.jpg","description":"Stay on top of all the latest publications on Biofilm research curated from PubMed. #biofilm #microbiology #antibioticresistance.
