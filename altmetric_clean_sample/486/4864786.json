However, the molecular mechanism underlying the function of miR\u2011145, specifically its targets in gastric carcinoma have yet to be fully elucidated. In the present study, downregulation of miR\u2011145 and upregulation of FSCN1 was identified in gastric carcinoma cell lines, compared with normal gastric mucosal epithelial cells. A luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that miR\u2011145 was able to bind to the 3'\u2011untranslated region of FSCN1 mRNA. Overexpression of miR\u2011145 led to a significant decrease in FSCN1 expression levels, whereas knockdown of miR\u2011145 resulted in increased FSCN1 expression levels in gastric carcinoma cells. Furthermore, overexpression of miR\u2011145 inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion in gastric carcinoma cells. Similar effects were also observed in gastric carcinoma cells transfected with FSCN1 small interfering RNA. In addition, overexpression of FSCN1 reversed the suppressive effects of miR\u2011145 upregulation on proliferation, migration and invasion in gastric carcinoma cells, suggesting that FSCN1 is indeed involved in the miR\u2011145\u2011mediated malignant phenotype of gastric carcinoma cells. The present study revealed an anti\u2011oncogenic role of miR\u2011145 in gastric carcinoma via inhibition of FSCN1, and suggested that miR\u2011145 may be used for the treatment of gastric carcinoma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Xue, Minghui","Zhao, Lunde","Yang, Fang","Li, Zhenjuan","Li, Guangyan"],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2015.4609","first_seen_on":"2015-12-11T00:50:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-3004"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1449795003,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26647829?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26647829","pubdate":"2015-12-11T22:01:03+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"MicroRNA\u2011145 inhibits the malignant phenotypes of gastric carcinoma cells via downregulation of fascin\u00a01 expression.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna145-inhibits-malignant-phenotypes-gastric-carcinoma-cells-via-downregulation-fascin-1-expres"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6738406,"mean":6.1618062182355,"rank":5758497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6738406,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284711,"mean":8.6232489902005,"rank":229959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284711,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1690,"mean":1.4165731201895,"rank":818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1690,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159,"mean":0.90253164556962,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/675115293111394304","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4864786],"posted_on":"2015-12-11T00:50:03+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
