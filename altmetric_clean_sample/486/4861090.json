We hypothesize that real-time monitoring of both symptoms and clinical syndromes will improve symptom management by oncologists and patient outcomes.\nIn this prospective multicenter cluster-randomized phase-III trial patients with incurable, symptomatic, solid tumors, who received new outpatient chemotherapy with palliative intention, were eligible. Immediately before the weekly oncologists' visit patients completed the palm-based E-MOSAIC assessment (Edmonton-Symptom-Assessment-Scale, \u22643 additional symptoms, estimated nutritional intake, body weight change, Karnofsky Performance Status, medications for pain, fatigue, nutrition). A cumulative, longitudinal monitoring sheet (LoMoS) was printed immediately. Eligible experienced oncologists were defined as one cluster each and randomized to receive the immediate print-out LoMoS (intervention) or not (control). Primary analysis limited to patients having uninterrupted (>4\/6 visits with same oncologist) patient-oncologist sequences was a mixed model for the difference in patients global quality of life (G-QoL; items 29\/30 of EORTC-QlQ-c30) between baseline (BL) and week 6. Intention-to-treat analysis included all eligible patients.\nIn 8 centers, 82 oncologists treated 264 patients (median 66y; overall survival intervention 6.3, control 5.4 mts) with various tumors. The between-arm difference in G-QoL of 102 uninterrupted patients (intervention: 55; control: 47) was 6.8 (p=0.11) in favour of the intervention, in a sensitivity analysis (oncologists treating \u22652 patients; 50, 39) it was 9.0 (p=0.07). Intention-to-treat analysis revealed improvement in symptoms (difference last study visit - BL: intervention -5.4 versus control 2.1, p= 0.003) and favoured the intervention for communication and coping. More patients with high symptom load received immediate symptom management (chart review, nurse-patient interview) by oncologists getting the LoMoS.\nMonitoring of patient symptoms, clinical syndromes and their management clearly reduced patients' symptoms, but not QoL. Our results encourage the implementation of real-time monitoring in the routine workflow of oncologist with a computer solution.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002280","authors":["Strasser, F","Blum, D","von Moos, R","Cathomas, R","Ribi, K","Aebi, S","Betticher, D","Hayoz, S","Klingbiel, D","Brauchli, P","Haefner, M","Mauri, S","Kaasa, S","Koeberle, D",", "],"doi":"10.1093\/annonc\/mdv576","first_seen_on":"2015-12-10T11:09:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1569-8041"],"issue":"2","journal":"Annals of Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1454253338,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26646758?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26646758?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26646758?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/m.annonc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/01\/06\/annonc.mdv576.abstract?papetoc","http:\/\/annonc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/27\/2\/324.long"],"pmid":"26646758","pubdate":"2015-12-10T22:01:37+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"The effect of real-time electronic monitoring of patient-reported symptoms and clinical syndromes in outpatient workflow of medical oncologists: E-MOSAIC, a multicenter cluster-randomized phase III study (SAKK 95\/06).","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-realtime-electronic-monitoring-patientreported-symptoms-clinical-syndromes-outpatient-workflo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7066845,"mean":6.2846355963116,"rank":2512960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4522956,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7066845,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288413,"mean":8.7656673162003,"rank":86996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":199531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288413,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3096,"mean":7.5290281098546,"rank":1408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3096,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164,"mean":7.6833865030675,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":89,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
