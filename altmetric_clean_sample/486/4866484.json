For instance, microfluidic devices are now commonly found in most research centers, clinics and hospitals, contributing to more accurate studies and therapies as powerful tools for drug delivery, monitoring of specific analytes, and medical diagnostics. Most remarkably, integration of cellularized constructs within microengineered platforms has enabled the recapitulation of the physiological and pathological conditions of complex tissues and organs. The so-called \"organ-on-a-chip\" technology, which represents a new avenue in the field of advanced in vitro models, with the potential to revolutionize current approaches to drug screening and toxicology studies. This review aims to highlight recent advances of microfluidic-based devices towards a body-on-a-chip concept, exploring their technology and broad applications in the biomedical field.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Ana Perestrelo"],"doi":"10.3390\/s151229848","first_seen_on":"2015-12-11T15:32:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"12","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1449829004,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/15\/12\/29848"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/15\/12\/29848\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4721768","pmid":"26690442","pubdate":"2015-12-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Microfluidic Organ\/Body-on-a-Chip Devices at the Convergence of Biology and Microengineering","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microfluidic-organbodyonachip-devices-convergence-biology-microengineering"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6738406,"mean":6.1618062182355,"rank":5758504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6738406,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284711,"mean":8.6232460047065,"rank":229962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284711,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2230,"mean":1.8153602512337,"rank":1826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2230,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136,"mean":2.0927407407407,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
