Among the cells of the immune system that regulate bone turnover and the responsiveness of bone cells to calciothropic hormones are bone marrow T lymphocytes. T\u00a0cells secrete osteoclastogenic cytokines such as RANKL and TNF-\u03b1, as well as factors that stimulate bone formation, one of which is Wnt10b. In addition, T\u00a0cells regulate the differentiation and life span of stromal cells (SCs) and their responsiveness to parathyroid hormone (PTH) via costimulatory molecules expressed on their surface. The conditioning effect of T\u00a0cells on SCs is inherited by the osteoblastic and osteocytic progeny of SCs. As a result, osteoblastic cells of T\u00a0cell-deficient mice have functional characteristics different from corresponding cells of T\u00a0cell-replete mice. These differences include the ratio of RANKL\/OPG produced in response to continuous PTH treatment, and the osteoblastogenic response to intermittent PTH treatment. This article reviews the evidence indicating that the effects of PTH are mediated not only by osteoblasts and osteocytes but also by T\u00a0cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51b3cf058f6100038d2","authors":["Pacifici, Roberto","Roberto Pacifici"],"doi":"10.1111\/nyas.12969","endpage":"24","first_seen_on":"2015-12-10T21:20:41+00:00","funders":["niehs","niams"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1749-6632"],"issue":"1","journal":"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1475502294,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/nyas.12969&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nyas.12969\/abstract;jsessionid=431009FBD6AC0E231785CB927B525675.f03t02","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26662934?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26662934"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nyas.12969\/pdf","pmid":"26662934","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"11","subjects":["science"],"title":"T\u00a0cells, osteoblasts, and osteocytes: interacting lineages key for the bone anabolic and catabolic activities of parathyroid hormone","type":"article","volume":"1364","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/t-cells-osteoblasts-osteocytes-interacting-lineages-key-bone-anabolic-catabolic-activities-parathyro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11,"score_history":{"1y":9.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7474500,"mean":6.4836868429538,"rank":645494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":6820530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7474500,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":292928,"mean":8.8626702352461,"rank":34318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":258167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":292928,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4636,"mean":5.1241475728155,"rank":346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":4284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4636,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":7.2929491525424,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
