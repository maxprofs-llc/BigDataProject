Since their discovery, the mechanisms and mode of transmission and molecular structure of prions have begun to be established. There is, however, still much to be elucidated about prion diseases, including the development of potential therapeutic strategies for treatment. The significance of prion disease is discussed here, including the categories of human and animal prion diseases, disease transmission, disease progression and the development of symptoms and potential future strategies for treatment. Furthermore, the structure and function of the normal cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) and its importance in not only in prion disease development, but also in diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease will also be discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f6100085cb","authors":["Atkinson, Caroline J","Zhang, Kai","Munn, Alan L","Wiegmans, Adrian","Wei, Ming Q"],"doi":"10.1080\/19336896.2015.1110293","first_seen_on":"2015-12-11T11:31:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1933-690X"],"journal":"Prion","last_mentioned_on":1449808395,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26645475?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26645475","pubdate":"2015-12-11T22:01:50+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Prion Protein Scrapie and the Normal Cellular Prion Protein.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prion-protein-scrapie-normal-cellular-prion-protein"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6738406,"mean":6.1618062182355,"rank":3037308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3519738,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6738406,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284711,"mean":8.6232388043974,"rank":130512,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":142011,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284711,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244,"mean":2.7349300411523,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.75,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
