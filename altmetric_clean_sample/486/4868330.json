We conducted a laboratory incubation experiment using soil and litter collected from control and N addition (100 kg ha-1 year-1 for 10 years) plots. Different quantities of litter (0, 1, 2 and 4 g) were placed on 150 g soils collected from the same plots and incubated in microcosms for 270 days. We found that increased litter input strongly stimulated litter decomposition rate and CO2 release in both control and N fertilization microcosms, though reduced soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and dissolved inorganic N (DIN) concentration. Carbon input (C loss from litter decomposition) and carbon output (the cumulative C loss due to respiration) elevated with increasing litter input in both control and N fertilization microcosms. However, soil C loss potentials (C output-C input) reduced by 62% in control microcosms and 111% in N fertilization microcosms when litter addition increased from 1 g to 4 g, respectively. Our results indicated that increased litter input had a potential to suppress soil organic C loss especially for N addition plots.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Hui-Chao Li","Ya-Lin Hu","Rong Mao","Qiong Zhao","De-Hui Zeng"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0144665","first_seen_on":"2015-12-11T20:07:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1449863800,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0144665"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0144665.PDF","pmcid":"PMC4676631","pmid":"26657180","pubdate":"2015-12-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0144665","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Effects of Nitrogen Addition on Litter Decomposition and CO 2 Release: Considering Changes in Litter Quantity","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-nitrogen-addition-litter-decomposition-co2-release-considering-changes-litter-quantity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6738406,"mean":6.1618062182355,"rank":5758525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6738406,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284711,"mean":8.6232126374205,"rank":229966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284711,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101013,"mean":9.9236786520415,"rank":84848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101013,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5006,"mean":10.667986813187,"rank":4137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5006,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
