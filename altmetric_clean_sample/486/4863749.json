It has been assumed that the same subcortical pathways and brain regions underlie all instances of\u00a0the StartReact effect.\u00a0They are\u00a0proposed to\u00a0involve\u00a0the startle reflex pathways and the eliciting mechanism is\u00a0distinct from other ways in which\u00a0sound can affect the motor system. We present an integrative review which shows that there is no evidence to support these assumptions. We argue that motor command generation for learned, volitional orofacial, laryngeal and distal limb movements is cortical and the StartReact effect for such movements involves transcortical pathways. In contrast, command generation for saccades, locomotor corrections and postural adjustments is subcortical and subcortical pathways are implicated in the StartReact effect for these cases. We conclude that the StartReact effect is not a special phenomenon mediated\u00a0by startle reflex pathways, but rather is a particular\u00a0manifestation of the excitatory effects of intense stimulation on the central nervous system.
