Among the subset of HIV-infected men without plasma viral suppression at the time of semen washing, no HIV seroconversions occurred among 1,023 women after 2,863 cycles of assisted reproduction with the use of washed semen. Studies that measured HIV transmission to infants reported no cases of vertical transmission. Overall, 56.3% of couples (2,357\/4,184) achieved a clinical pregnancy with the use of washed semen.\nSemen washing appears to significantly reduce the risk of transmission in HIV-discordant couples desiring children, regardless of viral suppression in the male partner. There are no randomized controlled studies or studies from low-income countries, especially those with a large burden of HIV. Continued development of lower-cost semen washing and assisted reproduction technologies is needed. Integration of semen washing into HIV prevention interventions could help to further reduce the spread of HIV.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c7","authors":["Zafer, Maryam","Horvath, Hacsi","Mmeje, Okeoma","van der Poel, Sheryl","Semprini, Augusto","Rutherford, George","Brown, Joelle","Semprini, Augusto E","Maryam Zafer","Hacsi Horvath","Okeoma Mmeje","Sheryl van der Poel","Augusto E.
