Mixing and transmembrane pressure (TMP) across a hollow fiber membrane placed in a recirculation loop coupled to a stirred tank were investigated, so that the loop did not significantly modify the hydrodynamic properties in the tank. The fouling mechanism, due to cake layer formation, was reversible. A cleaning procedure based on gas scouring and backwashing with the substrate was defined. Low TMP, 10(4)Pa, was required to achieve a 3Lh(-1)m(-2) critical flux. During fermentation, BioH2 production was shown to restart after removing VFAs with the permeate, so as to enhance simultaneously BioH2 production and the recovery of VFAs as platform molecules.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f5","authors":["Zaineb Trad","Julius Akimbomi","Christophe Vial","Christian Larroche","Mohammad J Taherzadeh","Jean-Pierre Fontaine"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biortech.2015.07.095","first_seen_on":"2015-12-11T14:06:46+00:00","issns":["1873-2976"],"journal":"Bioresource Technology","last_mentioned_on":1449822162,"links":["https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/280866557_Development_of_a_Submerged_Anaerobic_Membrane_Bioreactor_for_Concurrent_Extraction_of_Volatile_Fatty_Acids_and_Biohydrogen_Production"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Christian_Larroche\/publication\/280866557_Development_of_a_Submerged_Anaerobic_Membrane_Bioreactor_for_Concurrent_Extraction_of_Volatile_Fatty_Acids_and_Biohydrogen_Production\/links\/55cd9f7f08aeeaab209b5643.pdf","pmid":"26253913","pubdate":"2015-07-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Development of a Submerged Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor for Concurrent Extraction of Volatile Fatty Acids and Biohydrogen Production","type":"article","volume":"196","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-submerged-anaerobic-membrane-bioreactor-concurrent-extraction-volatile-fatty-acids-biohy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6738406,"mean":6.1618062182355,"rank":3244252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1995925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6738406,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284712,"mean":8.62321360959,"rank":144263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":109852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284712,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1580,"mean":2.0649740341989,"rank":543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1580,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":1.1925373134328,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
