To support this plan, a service protocol in family planning centers allows nurse delivery of OC.\nThis is a pilot feasibility study. After a medical prescription of OC, the nurse is authorized to deliver OC for 3months after a nursing interview. The duration of the nursing follow-up is determined by the physician.\nA total of 244\u00a0nurses interviews of 170\u00a0women were conducted between January 2012\u00a0and July 2013. All women have benefited from a delivery of contraceptives by the nurse. Analysis shows that 40\u00a0interviews (16%) had one or more abnormal criteria. Of these, more than a quarter found poor tolerance of contraception and\/or the appearance of gynecological symptoms (27%) or unprotected sex with a new partner (25%). In these cases, an orientation to the physician was more frequent (85% versus 62%, P=0.005) and faster (median 33days versus 90days, P<0.001) than if the nurse interview was normal.\nOur study shows the feasibility of delivery protocol of oral contraception by nurses following an initial prescription by the physician.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b01","authors":["Menard, J-P","Hennequin, F","Buresi, I",", "],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jgyn.2015.10.004","first_seen_on":"2015-12-11T14:23:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03682315","1773-0430"],"journal":"Journal de Gyn\u00e9cologie Obst\u00e9trique et Biologie de la Reproduction","last_mentioned_on":1449823675,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0368231515003427?_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_docanchor&md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb"],"pmid":"26655690","pubdate":"2015-12-15T22:03:18+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","reproductivemedicine","gynecology"],"title":"D\u00e9livrance par l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re de la contraception orale suite \u00e0 une prescription m\u00e9dicale initiale aux mineurs et aux non-assur\u00e9s sociaux dans les centres de planification et d\u2019\u00e9ducation familiale du Val-de-Marne ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dlivrance-par-linfirmire-la-contraception-orale-suite-une-prescription-mdicale-initiale-aux-mineurs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6738406,"mean":6.1618062182355,"rank":4997128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":979935,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6738406,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284711,"mean":8.6232409118049,"rank":192495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":54750,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284711,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248,"mean":1.3761295546559,"rank":140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.95,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/veille_afar\/statuses\/675235549905600512","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4866217],"posted_on":"2015-12-11T08:47:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Veille p\u00e9rinat","url":"http:\/\/netvibes.com\/afar","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/875154980\/ronde-coloree_normal.jpg","description":"Alliance francophone pour l'accouchement respect\u00e9 AFAR.
