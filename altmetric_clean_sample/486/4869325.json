In this context, various nanoparticles (NPs) have been developed for targeted delivery of diagnostic\/therapeutic agents to the tumor sites, which thus result in greater efficacy and much less side effects. The targeting property of NPs is often achieved by functionalizing their surface with tumor-specific ligands, such as antibodies, peptides, small molecules and oligonucleotides. In this review, we will discuss recent progress in the multifunctional design of antibody-targeted NPs with a special focus on liposomal, polymeric and protein-based delivery systems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000823a","authors":["Vahid Heravi Shargh"],"doi":"10.2217\/nnm.15.186","first_seen_on":"2015-12-12T04:22:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1748-6963"],"issue":"1","journal":"Nanomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1449894127,"links":["http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/doi\/abs\/10.2217\/nnm.15.186?ai=su&mi=0&af=R"],"pmid":"26654068","pubdate":"2015-12-15T22:03:55+00:00","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Antibody-targeted biodegradable nanoparticles for cancer therapy","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antibodytargeted-biodegradable-nanoparticles-cancer-therapy-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6739821,"mean":6.1636345691711,"rank":4998187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":980218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6739821,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284696,"mean":8.6318070707247,"rank":192511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":54683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284696,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":421,"mean":2.8725952380952,"rank":259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":421,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":8.3012,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
