Both strains expressing wild-type xylA (coding XI) from the fungus Orpinomyces sp. and the bacterium Prevotella ruminicola, respectively, showed better growth ability and fermentation capacity when using xylose as the sole sugar than most of the reported strains expressing XI. Codon optimization of both XIs did not improve the xylose fermentation ability of the strains. Adaption significantly increased XI activity resulting in improved growth and fermentation. The strains expressing codon-optimized XI showed a higher increase in xylose consumption and ethanol production compared to strains expressing wild XI. Among all strains, the adapted strain YCPA2E expressing XI from P.\u00a0ruminicola showed the best performance in the fermentation of xylose to ethanol. After 48\u00a0h of fermentation, YCPA2E assimilated 16.95\u00a0g\/L xylose and produced 6.98\u00a0g\/L ethanol. These results indicate that YC-8 is a suitable host strain for XI expression, especially for the codon-optimized XI originating from P.\u00a0ruminicola.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd2","authors":["Li, Yun-Cheng","Li, Guo-Ying","Gou, Min","Xia, Zi-Yuan","Tang, Yue-Qin","Kida, Kenji"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbiosc.2015.10.013","first_seen_on":"2015-12-10T19:18:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1347-4421"],"journal":"Journal of Bioscience & Bioengineering","last_mentioned_on":1449771455,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26645659?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26645659","pubdate":"2015-12-10T22:02:01+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering","microbiology"],"title":"Functional expression of xylose isomerase in flocculating industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain for bioethanol production.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/functional-expression-xylose-isomerase-flocculating-industrial-saccharomyces-cerevisiae-strain-bioet"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6737133,"mean":6.1593032756354,"rank":5757628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6737133,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283225,"mean":8.6428393074032,"rank":228778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283225,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":420,"mean":1.6987255369928,"rank":254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":420,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.775,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":6,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":5,"Chemistry":1,"Energy":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":9,"Chemical Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1},"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/statuses\/675016524927598592","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4863469],"posted_on":"2015-12-10T18:17:35+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
