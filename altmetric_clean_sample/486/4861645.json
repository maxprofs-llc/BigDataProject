Soil samples were collected with the method of soil drilling. Significant differences of electrical conductivity (EC) in the soil depth of 0-60\u00a0cm were observed among the three modes (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In the above three modes, the variation of soil salinity among various soil layers and monthly variation of soil salinity were the highest in SSM and reached 2.30 and 2.23\u00a0mS\/cm (EC1:5), respectively. Due to the effect of salinity, fine root biomass (FRB) showed significant differences in different soil depths (p\u2009<\u20090.05). More than 60\u00a0% of FRB was concentrated in the soil depth above 30\u00a0cm. FRB showed exponential decline with soil depth (p\u2009<\u20090.05). FRB showed spatial heterogeneity in the 40-cm soil depth. In the above three modes, compared with FRB, specific root length (SRL) and fine root length density (FRLD) showed the similar changing trend. Fine roots showed significant seasonal differences among different modes (p\u2009<\u20090.05). FRB showed the bimodal variation and was the highest in July. However, we found that the high content of salts had obvious inhibitory effect on the distribution of FRB. Therefore, the salinity should be below 1.5\u00a0mS\/cm, which was suitable for the growth of plant roots. Among the three modes, TSSM had the highest FRB, SRL, and FRLD and no obvious soil salt accumulation was observed. The results indicated that fine root biomass was affected by high salt and that TSSM had the strong effects of salt suppression and control. In our study, TSSM may be the optimal configuration mode for salt suppression and control in saline soil.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000653d","authors":["Jiang, Hong","Du, Hongyu","Bai, Yingying","Hu, Yue","Rao, Yingfu","Chen, Chong","Cai, Yongli"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11356-015-5764-0","first_seen_on":"2015-12-10T11:50:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1614-7499"],"journal":"Environmental Science & Pollution Research","last_mentioned_on":1449747995,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26645228?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26645228","pubdate":"2015-12-10T22:02:11+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atmospheric Protection\/Air Quality Control\/Air Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecotoxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Waste Water Technology \/ Water Pollution Control \/ Water Management \/ Aquatic Pollution","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Effects of spatiotemporal variation of soil salinity on fine root distribution in different plant configuration modes in new reclamation coastal saline field.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-spatiotemporal-variation-soil-salinity-fine-root-distribution-different-plant-configuration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6737133,"mean":6.1593032756354,"rank":5757586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6737133,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283225,"mean":8.6428578439679,"rank":228763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283225,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1613,"mean":2.241117866005,"rank":941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1613,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":1.0666055045872,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
