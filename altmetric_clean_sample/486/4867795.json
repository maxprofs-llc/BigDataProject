(PlantPhysiol)"],"citation":{"abstract":"Last-century climate change has led to variable increases of the intrinsic water-use efficiency (Wi, the ratio of net CO2 assimilation to stomatal conductance for water vapour) of trees and C3 grassland ecosystems, but the causes for the variability are not well understood. Here, we address putative drivers underlying variable Wi-responses in a wide range of grassland communities. Wi was estimated from carbon isotope discrimination (13\u0394) in archived herbage samples from sixteen contrasting fertilizer treatments on the Park Grass Experiment, Rothamsted, England for the 1915-1929 and the 1995-2009 periods. Changes in Wi were analysed in relation to nitrogen input, soil-pH, species richness and functional group composition. Treatments included liming and phosphorus and potassium additions, with or without ammonium or nitrate fertilizer applications at three levels. Wi increased between 11 and 25% (P < 0.001) in the different treatments between the two periods. None of the fertilizers had a direct effect on the change of Wi (\u0394Wi). However, soil-pH (P < 0.05), species richness (P < 0.01) and percentage grass content (P < 0.01) were significantly related to \u0394Wi. Grass-dominated, species-poor plots on acidic soils showed the largest \u0394Wi (+14.7 \u03bcmol mol-1). The \u0394Wi-response of these acidic plots was probably related to drought effects resulting from aluminium toxicity on root growth. Our results from the Park Grass Experiment show that Wi in grassland communities consistently increased over a wide range of nutrient inputs, soil-pH and plant community compositions during the last century.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333b","authors":["Iris Heike K\u00f6hler","Andy Macdonald","Hans Schnyder","Iris H.
