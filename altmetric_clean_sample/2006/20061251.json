A decomposing elderly woman was found in her presumed home with bilateral upper extremity amputations and craniocerebral trauma. This raised suspicion of foul play. Subsequent investigations together with autopsy led the medical examiner to conclude that the cause of death was natural disease and that those injuries found on her body were produced by at least one of the dogs who shared the premises. We linked the canine culprit to the postmortem trauma and positively identified the remains by collecting material defecated by the animal and by using radiologic and dental comparison techniques.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006975","authors":["Chute, Dennis J.","Bready, Robert J."],"doi":"10.1097\/paf.0000000000000303","first_seen_on":"2017-05-12T07:05:22+00:00","issns":["0195-7910"],"issue":"2","journal":"The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1505856462,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/amjforensicmedicine\/Abstract\/2017\/06000\/A_Case_of_Postmortem_Canine_Depredation.4.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/amjforensicmedicine\/Fulltext\/2017\/06000\/A_Case_of_Postmortem_Canine_Depredation.4.aspx?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/amjforensicmedicine\/2017\/06000\/A_Case_of_Postmortem_Canine_Depredation.4.pdf","pmid":"28230652","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"100","subjects":["pathology","jurisprudence"],"title":"A Case of Postmortem Canine Depredation","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/amjforensicmedicine\/Fulltext\/2017\/06000\/A_Case_of_Postmortem_Canine_Depredation.4.aspx","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/case-postmortem-canine-depredation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":2,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8436356,"mean":7.0937825748122,"rank":3668336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4646925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8436356,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249126,"mean":12.580535650777,"rank":102467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":142605,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249126,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":670,"mean":3.4730164424514,"rank":301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":670,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.6027777777778,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
