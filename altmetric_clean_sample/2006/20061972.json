The influence of seasonal variations and mosquito species on mosquito gut microbiota is poorly understood. We sought to determine whether the mosquito microbiota associated with immature stages of two congeners (Culex coronator and Culex nigripalpus) differ temporally and between the two species. Using high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, we characterized bacterial and archaeal communities found in the immature stages of the two Culex mosquito species sampled over three seasons to compare the diversity of bacteria between the two species. Beta diversity analyses of the larval microbiota sequences revealed that the two Culex species differed significantly, both temporally within each species and between the two species. Bacteria in Cx. coronator larvae were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria, mainly associated with Roseoccocus and unidentified species of Rhizobiales, and two unidentified species of Cyanobacteria. In contrast, Cx. nigripalpus was dominated by Thorsellia anophelis (Gammaproteobacteria), Clostridium, an unidentified species of Ruminococcacae (Clostridiales), and additional unidentified species associated with Erysipelotrichaceae (Erysipelotrichales), Bacteroidales, and Mollicutes. Results of our study revealed both seasonal and interspecies differences in bacterial community composition associated with the immature stages of Cx. coronator and Cx. nigripalpus vector populations in Florida. These results have important implications for our understanding of the underlying factors of variations in disease transmission among seasons, susceptibility to various pesticides, and other biotic factors, including the role of the microbiota on the spread of invasive species. In addition, our results suggest close associations of certain bacteria species with each of the two Culex species that will be further targeted for their potential in the development of microbial-based control strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5043cf058f6100030c3","authors":["Dagne Duguma","Michael W.
