As these injuries have no intrinsic healing capacity, early and accurate noninvasive diagnosis remains integral to determining the most appropriate treatment option in this class of patients. Although surgical success depends primarily on clinical outcomes, MRI evaluation can provide pertinent information regarding the status of the surgical repair and the progression of cartilage disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005819","authors":["Christopher M.
