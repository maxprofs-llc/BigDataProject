In this study, we compared a set of directly assayed common and rare variants from an exome array to imputed genotypes, i.e., 1000 genomes project (1000GP) and HRC. We showed that imputation using the HRC panel improved the concordance between assayed and imputed genotypes at common, and especially, low-frequency variants. Furthermore, we performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis of vertical cup-disc ratio (VCDR), a highly heritable endophenotype of glaucoma, in four cohorts using 1000GP and HRC imputations. We compared the results of the meta-analysis using 1000GP to the meta-analysis results using HRC. Overall, we found that using HRC imputation significantly improved P-values (P = 3.07 \u00d7 10(-61) ), particularly for suggestive variants. Both meta-analyses were performed in the same sample size, yet we found eight genome-wide significant loci in the HRC-based meta-analysis versus seven genome-wide significant loci in the 1000GP-based meta-analysis. This study provides supporting evidence of the new avenues for gene discovery and fine mapping that the HRC imputation panel offers. This article is protected by copyright.
