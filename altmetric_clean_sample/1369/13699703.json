Despite the high rate of diabetes in the M\u0101ori population, little is known about their personal understanding or experience of the disease.\nTo engage M\u0101ori in a participatory process to develop a culturally relevant diabetes prevention documentary.\nPrinciples of community-based participatory research (CBPR) were applied to a qualitative research design employing key informant interviews and focus groups to develop a diabetes prevention documentary.\nA CBPR approach provides an appropriate model for enacting local action-oriented approaches in the creation of a documentary that reflects M\u0101ori cultural beliefs and practices.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008626","authors":["Alison Farmer","Jeffrey Gage","Ray Kirk","Timothy Edgar"],"doi":"10.1353\/cpr.2016.0045","endpage":"390","first_seen_on":"2016-11-16T18:02:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-055X","1557-0541"],"issue":"3","journal":"Progress in Community Health Partnerships:  Research, Education, and Action","last_mentioned_on":1479319359,"links":["http:\/\/muse.jhu.edu\/article\/635731"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/muse.jhu.edu\/article\/635731\/pdf","pmid":"28230546","pubdate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Johns Hopkins University Press","startpage":"383","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Applying Community-Based Participatory Research to Create a Diabetes Prevention Documentary with New Zealand M\u0101ori","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/applying-communitybased-participatory-research-create-diabetes-prevention-documentary-new-zealand-m%C4%81"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7700472,"mean":6.6097995325169,"rank":5823145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1038749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7700472,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208541,"mean":13.121663824686,"rank":143481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":39764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208541,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227,"mean":1.9027876106195,"rank":144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":4.5769230769231,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PCHP\/statuses\/798949418263265281","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13699703],"posted_on":"2016-11-16T18:02:39+00:00","author":{"name":"PCHP","url":"http:\/\/www.press.jhu.edu\/journals\/progress_in_community_health_partnerships\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/314917692\/PCHPLogo_normal.gif","description":"The first scholarly journal dedicated to Community-Based Participatory Research (#CBPR), #community #health, and #partnership.","id_on_source":"PCHP","tweeter_id":"57035869","geo":{"lt":41.85003,"ln":-87.65005,"country":"US"},"followers":172},"tweet_id":"798949418263265281"}]}}
