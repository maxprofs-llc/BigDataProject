Here, for the first time, we report the successful use of the PCSK9 inhibitor in a patient with refractory nephrotic syndrome.\nA 61-year-old woman was diagnosed with minimal change-type nephrotic syndrome in October 2012. She received prednisolone (PSL) and cyclosporin A (CyA), but she experienced several cycles of relapse and remission and was hospitalized in May 2016 due to relapse. However, in spite of steroid pulse therapy and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) administration, her urinary protein level did not improve. We started her on evolocumab with the expectation of equivalent LDL-lowering effects as seen with LDL apheresis. After that, the LDL cholesterol level and UP\/UC were concomitantly decreased, and the serum albumin was increased. This was maintained even when we reduced the PSL dose. This suggests that evolocumab clinically improves the nephrotic condition.\nNo other report has described the use of evolocumab for nephrotic syndrome (NS) or its effect on similar nephrotic conditions. We believe that the findings presented here are unique and may be beneficial when treating similar cases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007cb","authors":["Yuki Awanami","Makoto Fukuda","Yasunori Nonaka","Tsuyoshi Takashima","Keiichiro Matsumoto","Masatora Yamasaki","Motoaki Miyazono","Yuji Ikeda","Yuki Awanami","Makoto Fukuda","Yasunori Nonaka","Tsuyoshi Takashima","Keiichiro Matsumoto","Masatora Yamasaki","Motoaki Miyazono","Yuji Ikeda"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12882-017-0644-0","first_seen_on":"2017-07-09T10:57:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1471-2369"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Nephrology","last_mentioned_on":1499852906,"links":["http:\/\/bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12882-017-0644-0"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12882-017-0644-0?site=bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28683788","pubdate":"2017-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"221","subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Successful treatment of a patient with refractory nephrotic syndrome with PCSK9 inhibitors: a case report","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/successful-treatment-patient-refractory-nephrotic-syndrome-pcsk9-inhibitors-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.65,"score_history":{"1y":8.65,"6m":8.65,"3m":8.65,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.65},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8431605,"mean":7.0911056112138,"rank":1053775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7376020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8431605,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232954,"mean":12.885146282726,"rank":42836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":189983,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232954,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":993,"mean":2.6985342741935,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":993,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":3.8697872340426,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"researcher":2,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"VE":1,"US":2,"FR":1,"BR":1,"ID":1,"IN":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pedsnephrology\/statuses\/884003563470508033","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21678887],"posted_on":"2017-07-09T10:57:28+00:00","author":{"name":"Shatat","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/704846774683369472\/x8K7xC4w_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"pedsnephrology","tweeter_id":"1402078842","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":212},"tweet_id":"884003563470508033"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VICTORSANNA\/statuses\/884028235964719104","license":"gnip","rt":["pedsnephrology"],"citation_ids":[21678887],"posted_on":"2017-07-09T12:35:30+00:00","author":{"name":"VICTOR SANNA","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/699183828603162624\/cTEFKuux_normal.jpg","description":"Pediatric Nephrologist at the Dr. Rafael Guerra Mendez Medical Center, Valencia-Venezuela","id_on_source":"VICTORSANNA","tweeter_id":"139294924","geo":{"lt":10.16202,"ln":-68.00765,"country":"VE"},"followers":1084},"tweet_id":"884028235964719104"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rheault_m\/statuses\/884047252095991813","license":"gnip","rt":["pedsnephrology"],"citation_ids":[21678887],"posted_on":"2017-07-09T13:51:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Michelle Rheault","url":"https:\/\/scholar.google.ca\/citations?hl=en&user=RSBJjqsAAAAJ","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/741425662477533185\/AR-YandR_normal.jpg","description":"Pediatric nephrologist, dialysis medical director #NephJC Tweets are my own.
