Cytoskeletal organization and dynamics depend on protein self-associations and interactions with regulatory elements such as microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). The MAP family includes large proteins like MAP-1A, MAP-1B, MAP-1C, MAP-2, and MAP-4 and smaller components like tau and MAP-2C. This review focuses on relevant aspects of MAP function, with emphasis on their roles in modulating cytoskeletal interactions. In this context, MAP expression mechanisms and posttranslational modifications are also discussed. Microtubule-associated proteins have a rather widespread distribution among cells, but certain MAPs have been identified in specific cell types. Within single neurons, MAP-2 is dendritic while tau is preferentially an axonal protein. Their expression is developmentally regulated. Even though MAPs share a capacity to interact with the COOH-terminal tubulin domain, stabilize microtubules, and link them with other cytoskeletal polymers, they exhibit structural differences. However, MAP-2, MAP-4, and tau have common repetitive microtubule-binding motifs. Microtubule-associated proteins not only control cytoskeletal integrity, but they also appear to interact with highly structural elements of cells. Molecular biological approaches permitted localization of new MAPs in cultured mammalian cells and invertebrate organisms and other microtubule-interacting proteins that exhibit transient interactions with microtubules. The structural\/functional aspects of several new MAP-like proteins in centrosomes and the mitotic spindle, functionally implicated in cell cycle events, are also analyzed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037c7","authors":["R.
