This particular phenotype has been studied for the last decades and the clarification of the etiopathogenic causes are still needed. Several mechanisms involved in the formation and maintenance of oncocytomas are accepted as reasonable causes, but the relevance and contribution of each one for oncocytic transformation may depend on different cancer etiopathogenic contexts. In this review, we describe the current knowledge of the etiopathogenic events that may lead to oncocytic transformation and discuss their contribution for tumor progression and mitochondrial accumulation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003507","authors":["Correia, Marcelo","Pinheiro, Pedro","Batista, Rui","Soares, Paula","Sobrinho-Sim\u00f5es, Manuel","M\u00e1ximo, Valdemar"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.semcancer.2017.06.014","first_seen_on":"2017-07-09T10:25:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1044-579X","1096-3650"],"journal":"Seminars in Cancer Biology","last_mentioned_on":1499595888,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28687249?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28687249","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Etiopathogenesis of oncocytomas","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/etiopathogenesis-oncocytomas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183187,"mean":6.9217013823156,"rank":7081535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183187,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176931,"mean":11.386658859436,"rank":143416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176931,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":325,"mean":3.1883024691358,"rank":260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":325,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":5.6586666666667,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AutophagyPapers\/statuses\/883995345792802817","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21678102],"posted_on":"2017-07-09T10:24:48+00:00","author":{"name":"Autophagy Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/559405603697590273\/EoGNUIXe_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for #Autophagy papers.
