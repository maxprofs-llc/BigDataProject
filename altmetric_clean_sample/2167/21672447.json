The study protocol included neuro-imaging (MRI 22 patients, CT 2 patients), Doppler sonography, and electro-oculography.\nMRI\/CT showed the presence of an infarction of the caudal cerebellum in six patients (25%), 3 of whom had a potential cardioembolic source and normal Doppler sonography findings, whereas 3 patients had ipsilateral vertebral artery occlusion and normal cardiac findings. MRI of the posterior fossa was normal in 18 patients. On electro-oculography, ataxic pursuit eye movements was a characteristic finding in patients with cerebellar infarction, whereas caloric test findings were not discriminative.\nA caudal cerebellar infarction may easily be misdiagnosed clinically as a labyrinthine disorder, and was found to be the cause in one fourth of patients presenting with isolated acute vertigo.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002158","authors":["Norrving, B","Magnusson, M","Holt\u00e5s, S"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-09T06:29:26+00:00","issns":["0001-6314"],"issue":"1","journal":"Acta Neurologica Scandinavica","last_mentioned_on":1371236400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7732773"],"pmid":"7732773","pubdate":"1995-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Isolated acute vertigo in the elderly; vestibular or vascular disease?","type":"article","volume":"91","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isolated-acute-vertigo-elderly-vestibular-vascular-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8031452,"mean":6.80952670918,"rank":1550690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6446384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8031452,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104038,"mean":10.701599161837,"rank":24323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":79561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104038,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1080,"mean":3.421796107507,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1080,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.26875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":4,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":14,"Neuroscience":2,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"NL":1,"KR":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Vertigini in PS: il nodo irrisolto?","url":"http:\/\/empills.com\/2013\/06\/vertigini-il-nodo-irrisolto\/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+EMpills+%28EMpills%29","citation_ids":[1490947,234338,16191118,8228677,1770015,21672444,458750,21672447,4846111,536582,236856,12597011,210373],"posted_on":"2013-06-14T19:00:00+00:00","summary":"Chi lavora in Pronto Soccorso sa che dal punto di vista diagnostico il sintomo vertigine \u00e8 un po\u2019 come il vaso di Pandora: contiene un sacco di guai, cos\u00ec variegati fra loro, che la sola idea di passarli al setaccio tutti \u00e8 alquanto frustrante. \u00c8 per quest","author":{"name":"FOAM EM RSSFOAM EM RSS","url":"http:\/\/www.foamem.com","description":"Free Open Access Medical Education"}}]}}
