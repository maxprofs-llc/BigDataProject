One of its main purposes is to identify water bands as main coordinates of future absorbance patterns to be used as a system biomarker. This chapter presents the Aquaphotomics methodology and illustrates a way to identify specific water bands using temperature change and addition of solutions of different ionic strength as perturbations. Rapid and precise measurement of low concentration solutes has been given as a strong evidence of the vast information that \"the water spectral pattern as molecular mirror\" approach provides. Few applications using near infrared spectroscopy and multivariate analysis as main tools of Aquaphotomics have been presented.","aggregated_in":[12957204],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90b3cf058f61000caa9","authors":["Roumiana Tsenkova","Zoltan Kovacs","Yosuke Kubota"],"book":{"title":"Membrane Hydration","isbns":["9783319190594","9783319190600"],"uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/book\/10.1007%2F978-3-319-19060-0"},"doi":"10.1007\/978-3-319-19060-0_8","editors":["E.
