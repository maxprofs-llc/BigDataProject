A paradigm for this approach is the study of disorders caused by mutations in the gene for the neural cell recognition molecule L1. L1 is the founder member of a subfamily of cell adhesion molecules that are primarily expressed in the nervous system, and to date it is the only one to be associated with a hereditary disease. In this review we will summarize how the analysis of pathological mutations in L1 is complementing the study of mouse models and in vitro analysis of L1 function.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f61000767c","authors":["Kenwrick, S","Watkins, A","De Angelis, E"],"first_seen_on":"2016-10-24T15:54:34+00:00","issns":["0964-6906"],"issue":"6","journal":"Human Molecular Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1476902215,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10767310"],"pmid":"10767310","pubdate":"2000-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","geneticsmedical"],"title":"Neural cell recognition molecule L1: relating biological complexity to human disease mutations.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neural-cell-recognition-molecule-l1-relating-biological-complexity-human-disease-mutations-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085483,"mean":6.879699590196,"rank":2036123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4943964,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085483,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242746,"mean":12.89174560959,"rank":83855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":155171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242746,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4124,"mean":5.7276822701916,"rank":1243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":1592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4124,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":25.281527272727,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
