This antibody, called AbA, was found to precipitate a 70-kDa and a 45-kDa fraction of the detergent lysate of U937 cells and to inhibit ligand binding to Fc gamma R on the P388D1 murine macrophage cell line. In the present work we have characterised this antibody further. All Fc gamma RII-positive B lymphoblastoid cell lines, as well as resting human B lymphocytes, were positively stained with the AbA antibody. U937 cells were found to be negative, but after stimulation with phorbol ester (PMA), 50% of the cells became positive. AbA antibody did not react with human T cell lines or with the T + 0 cell subset of peripheral blood. Monocytes were also negative. On the other hand, AbA antibody exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of antibody-mediated cytotoxic reaction (ADCC) of monocytes, while not affecting K cell-mediated ADCC. It had an inhibitory effect of EA rosette formation of B cells and stimulated U937 cells. Furthermore, it interacted with the soluble form of Fc gamma RII released by activated B lymphocytes, and--similarly to IgG--precipitated a 33 kDa fraction from the supernatant of B cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a9b","authors":["Rozsnyay, Z","S\u00e1rmay, G","Szab\u00f3, I","Medgyesi, G","Gorini, G","Gergely, J"],"first_seen_on":"2016-10-24T17:45:04+00:00","issns":["0165-2478"],"issue":"4","journal":"Immunology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1477331086,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2147423"],"pmid":"2147423","pubdate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Fine specificity of a rabbit antibody interacting with human IgG Fc receptor-like molecules.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fine-specificity-rabbit-antibody-interacting-human-igg-fc-receptorlike-molecules"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7588328,"mean":6.5418890751503,"rank":1837585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4739058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7588328,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235310,"mean":12.652812778092,"rank":80116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":152057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235310,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":551,"mean":1.9859418181818,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":551,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.59,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Fc receptor-like molecule","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=745999398#altmetric_citation_f506a83b-cf1e-4d96-bfd0-42c21600ff54","license":"public","citation_ids":[12957119],"posted_on":"2016-10-24T17:44:46+00:00","summary":"Fc receptor-like molecules (FCRLs) are a class of proteins that resemble Fc receptors.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=12070684","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Chris Capoccia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Chris Capoccia"}}]}}
