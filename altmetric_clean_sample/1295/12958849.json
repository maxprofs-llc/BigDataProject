Very low and high serum bicarbonate (SB) have been related with a higher mortality. Acid-base balance also has been associated with hemodynamic effects in these patients. The trial aim was to compare the effect of DB concentration variation on SB levels in maintenance hemodiafiltration (HDF) patients and the effect on intradialytic hypotension and interdialytic weight gain. Methods\u2002 A prospective study, with 9 months of follow-up, involving 93 patients, divided in two groups: group 1 and group 2 with a DB of 34 mmol\/L and 30 mmol\/L, respectively, with monitoring of pre and post HDF SB, intradialytic hypotension, and interdialytic weight gain. Findings Pre dialysis SB was higher in group 1: median concentration of 22.7 mmol\/L vs. 21.1 mmol\/L (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Post dialysis SB levels were higher in group 1: median concentration of 28.0 mmol\/L vs. 25.3 mmol\/L (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Post dialysis SB in alkalotic range was only detected in group 1 (51.2% of the patients). No significant differences were detected in intradialytic hypotension rate [28.0 vs. 27.4 episodes per 1000 sessions in group 1 and 2, respectively, (P\u2009=\u20090.906)] or in average interdialytic weight gain [2.9% vs. 3.0% in group 1 and 2, respectively, (P\u2009=\u20090.710)]. Discussion DB of 30 mmol\/L appears to be associated with SB levels closer to physiological levels than 34 mmol\/L. The bicarbonate dialysate, in the tested concentrations, did not appear to have a significant impact on intradialytic hypotension and interdialytic weight gain in maintenance HDF patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029d9","authors":["Viegas, M\u00e1rcio","C\u00e2ndido, Cristina","Felgueiras, Joana","Clemente, Jos\u00e9","Barros, Sara","Farbota, Rostislav","Vera, Filipa","Matos, Antero","Sousa, Francisco"],"doi":"10.1111\/hdi.12502","first_seen_on":"2016-10-24T18:17:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1542-4758"],"journal":"Hemodialysis International","last_mentioned_on":1476928224,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/hdi.12502\/pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/hdi.12502\/pdf","pmid":"27761981","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Dialysate bicarbonate variation in maintenance hemodiafiltration patients: Impact on serum bicarbonate, intradialytic hypotension and interdialytic weight gain","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dialysate-bicarbonate-variation-maintenance-hemodiafiltration-patients-impact-serum-bicarbonate-intr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":10,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7565447,"mean":6.5306080289211,"rank":722065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":6813945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7565447,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234528,"mean":12.66798486315,"rank":37056,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":196694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234528,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240,"mean":1.8510376569038,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.37,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
