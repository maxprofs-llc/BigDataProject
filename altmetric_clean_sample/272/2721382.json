So far bisphosphonates have been the main pharmacological treatment option for patients with bone metastases. We present a case of bone metastatic gastric cancer treated with zoledronic acid at first and later with denosumab. After 1 year of denosumab treatment, the F-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG)-PET\/computed tomography scan reassessment documented a metabolic complete response, even in the absence of specific antiblastic treatment. Whether denosumab can be used directly after pretreatment with bisphosphonates has yet to be addressed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a63","doi":"10.1097\/cad.0000000000000169","first_seen_on":"2014-09-28T03:13:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0959-4973"],"journal":"Anti-Cancer Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1411873938,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/anti-cancerdrugs\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Impressive_response_to_denosumab_in_a_patient_with.99268.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/anti-cancerdrugs\/9000\/00000\/Impressive_response_to_denosumab_in_a_patient_with.99268.pdf","pmid":"25243456","pubdate":"2014-09-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["antineoplasticagents"],"title":"Impressive response to denosumab in a patient with bone metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach after 2 years of zoledronic acid.","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impressive-response-denosumab-patient-bone-metastatic-adenocarcinoma-stomach-after-2-years-zoledroni"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3052277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":936534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119966,"mean":8.1452870253826,"rank":75615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":31600,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119966,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":632,"mean":1.0824374009509,"rank":222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":632,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":0.86590909090909,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
