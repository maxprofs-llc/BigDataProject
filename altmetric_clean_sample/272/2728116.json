All forms of thallium are soluble enough to be toxic to living organisms. Thallium is more toxic to humans than mercury, cadmium, lead, copper or zinc and has been responsible for many accidental, occupational, deliberate, and therapeutic poisonings since its discovery in 1861. Its chemical behavior resembles the heavy metals (lead, gold and silver) on the one hand and the alkali metals (K, Rb, Cs) on the other. It occurs almost exclusively in natural waters as monovalent thallous cation. The solubility of thallous compounds is relatively high so that monovalent thallium is readily transported through aqueous routes into the environment. Tl can be transferred from soils to crops readily and accrues in food crops. The fascinating chemistry and high toxicity potential make thallium and its compounds of particular scientific interest and environmental concern. Thallium was detected in base-metal mining effluents. The conventional removal of heavy metals from wastewater has little effect on thallium. In this review, various treatment options and removal technologies are enumerated in order to protect the environment from thallium toxicity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027e3","doi":"10.1016\/j.envint.2004.09.003","first_seen_on":"2014-09-30T14:57:51+00:00","issns":["01604120"],"journal":"Environment International","last_mentioned_on":1412089037,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0160412004001540","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.envint.2004.09.003","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15788190"],"pmid":"15788190","pubdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Thallium: a review of public health and environmental concerns.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thallium-review-public-health-environmental-concerns-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4314659,"mean":4.9673304634293,"rank":931631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3352856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4314659,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116062,"mean":7.9627435400351,"rank":31616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":83674,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116062,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":605,"mean":7.2570397350993,"rank":180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":422,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":605,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":18.705866666667,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
