Objectives: An overview of systematic reviews that have evaluated pharmacological agents for the prevention of AKI post cardiac surgery. Data Sources: We searched electronic databases (PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) from inception to January 2014. Study selection: Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials that have evaluated pharmacological agents for the prevention of AKI in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Data analysis: Numbers needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) were calculated from pooled events given in each meta-analysis. Primary outcome measures were defined as (i) mortality, (ii) need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), and (iii) acute kidney injury. Results: Data from 7 systematic reviews evaluating 6 different pharmacological renoprotective agents were included. Dopamine, fenoldopam and N-acetylcysteine did not demonstrate any benefit in terms of mortality, need for RRT or incidence of AKI. Atrial natriuretic peptide reduced the need for RRT (NNT = 22 (95% CI: 13 to 73) and brain natriuretic peptide reduced the incidence of AKI (NNT = 11 (95% CI: 6 to 32), although both agents did not demonstrate any effect on mortality. Loop diuretics demonstrated increased incidence of AKI (NNH = 8 (95% CI: 5 to 15). Conclusion: There is a paucity of effective renoprotective agents that can be used in adult cardiac surgical patients. There is an urgent need to develop novel renoprotective strategies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026ad","authors":["Patel NN","Angelini GD"],"first_seen_on":"2014-09-29T21:05:36+00:00","funders":["bhf","dohuk"],"issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Current Pharmaceutical Design","last_mentioned_on":1412024708,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24669971\/"],"pmid":"24669971","pubdate":"2014-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Pharmacological Strategies For The Prevention Of Acute Kidney Injury Following Cardiac Surgery: An Overview Of Systematic Reviews.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacological-strategies-prevention-acute-kidney-injury-following-cardiac-surgery-overview-systema"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4309194,"mean":4.9774482950557,"rank":3404716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":124977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4309194,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115454,"mean":7.9759163295889,"rank":90444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115454,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1005,"mean":2.8717609561753,"rank":694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1005,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":1.3285714285714,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
