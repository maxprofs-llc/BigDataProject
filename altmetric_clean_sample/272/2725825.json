R. Plunk, with a soon-to-be lethal disease, has come to see you because you are the world's expert in complex aneurysm surgery and his is a case for the books. He has multiple comorbidities; the most concerning is his cardiopulmonary functioning. You have only operated on a few patients who are at this level of risk. He has been told repeatedly you are his only hope, which is literally true. A cure would pair one of the \"biggest operations\" with one of the frailest patients. You have been on an invincible roll and have decided to give it a shot, if he agrees. What is the most ethical informed consent in this case?","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f17","authors":["Jones JW","McCullough LB"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jvs.2014.07.032","first_seen_on":"2014-09-30T01:49:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0741-5214"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Vascular Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1411995780,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25260475"],"pmid":"25260475","pubdate":"2014-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Is \"your only hope\" medical treatment choice really a choice?","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/only-hope-medical-treatment-choice-really-choice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.176,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.176},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4309745,"mean":4.9743409911825,"rank":688592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3620375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4309745,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115977,"mean":7.9605404911362,"rank":23919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":92014,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115977,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1094,"mean":1.9147831655993,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1094,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.4159090909091,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
