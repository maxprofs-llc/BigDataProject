Central to Alzheimer pathology is also the fact that the longer A\u03b242 peptide is more prone to aggregation than the more prevalent A\u03b240 . Detailed structural studies of A\u03b2 oligomers and protofibrils have been impeded by aggregate heterogeneity and instability. We previously engineered a variant of A\u03b2 that forms stable protofibrils and here we use solid-state NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling to derive a structural model of these. NMR data are consistent with packing of residues 16 to 42 of A\u03b2 protomers into hexameric barrel-like oligomers within the protofibril. The core of the oligomers consists of all residues of the central and C-terminal hydrophobic regions of A\u03b2, and hairpin loops extend from the core. The model accounts for why A\u03b242 forms oligomers and protofibrils more easily than A\u03b240 .","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Lendel, Christofer","Bjerring, Morten","Dubnovitsky, Anatoly","Kelly, Robert T.","Filippov, Andrei","Antzutkin, Oleg N.","Nielsen, Niels Chr.","H\u00e4rd, Torleif"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201406357","endpage":"12760","first_seen_on":"2014-09-28T23:39:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"47","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
