Genetic variation in yield responsiveness to rising [CO2 ] would provide an opportunity to breed more responsive crop genotypes. A multi-year study of 18 soybean genotypes was done to identify variation in responsiveness to season-long elevated [CO2 ] (550 ppm) under fully open-air replicated field conditions. On average across 18 genotypes, elevated [CO2 ] stimulated total above-ground biomass by 22%, but seed yield by only 9%, in part because most genotypes showed a reduction in partitioning of energy to seeds. Over four years of study, there was consistency from year to year in the genotypes that were most and least responsive to elevated [CO2 ], suggesting heritability of CO2 response. Further analysis of six genotypes did not reveal a photosynthetic basis for the variation in yield response. Although partitioning to seed was decreased, cultivars with the highest partitioning coefficient in current [CO2 ] also had the highest partitioning coefficient in elevated [CO2 ]. The results show the existence of genetic variation in soybean response to elevated [CO2 ], which is needed to breed soybean to the future atmospheric environment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003340","authors":["Bishop KA","Betzelberger AM","Long SP","Ainsworth EA","BISHOP, KRISTEN A.","BETZELBERGER, AMY M.","LONG, STEPHEN P.","AINSWORTH, ELIZABETH A."],"doi":"10.1111\/pce.12443","endpage":"1774","first_seen_on":"2014-09-29T09:52:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1365-3040","0140-7791"],"issue":"9","journal":"Plant, Cell & Environment","last_mentioned_on":1502029643,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25211487","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pce.12443\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pce.12443\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pce.12443\/pdf","pmid":"25211487","pubdate":"2014-09-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1765","subjects":["cellbiology","botany"],"title":"Is there potential to adapt soybean (Glycine max\u2005Merr.) to future [CO2]?
