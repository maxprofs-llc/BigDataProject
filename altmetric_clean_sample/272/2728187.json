To identify whether consumption of added sugars, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and 100% fruit juice, as well as eating frequency, are associated with severe ECCs, cross-sectional data collected from a sample of low-income, racially diverse children aged 2 to 6 years were used. Four hundred fifty-four children with severe ECCs and 429 caries-free children were recruited in 2004-2008 from three pediatric dental clinics in Columbus, OH; Cincinnati, OH; and Washington, DC. Dietary data were obtained from one parent-completed 24-hour recall and an interviewer-administered food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess associations between severe ECCs and dietary variables. On average, children with severe ECCs consumed 3.2-4.8 fl oz more SSBs (24-hour recall=1.80 vs 1.17; P< 0.001; FFQ=0.82 vs 0.39; P<0.001) and reported significantly more daily eating occasions (5.26 vs 4.72; P<0.0001) than caries-free children. After controlling for age, sex, race\/ethnicity, maternal education, recruitment site, and family size, children with the highest SSB intake were 2.0 to 4.6 times more likely to have severe ECCs compared with those with the lowest intake, depending on dietary assessment method (24-hour recall odds ratio 2.02, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.06; FFQ odds ratio 4.63, 95% CI 2.86 to 7.49). The relationship between eating frequency and severe ECC status was no longer significant in multivariate analyses. Specific dietary guidance for parents of young children, particularly regarding SSB consumption, could help reduce severe ECC prevalence.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e8b","authors":["E.
