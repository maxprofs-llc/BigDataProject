Most chronic diseases are associated with underlying preventable risk factors, such as elevated blood pressure, blood glucose, and lipids, physical inactivity, excessive sedentary behaviours, overweight and obesity, and tobacco usage. Sugar-sweetened beverages are known to be significant sources of additional caloric intake, and given recent attention to their contribution in the development of chronic diseases, a systematic review is warranted. We will assess whether the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in adults is associated with adverse health outcomes and what the potential moderating factors are.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000089e","doi":"10.1186\/2046-4053-3-108","first_seen_on":"2014-09-30T15:16:42+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["2046-4053"],"issue":"1","journal":"Systematic Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1412865073,"links":["http:\/\/www.systematicreviewsjournal.com\/content\/3\/1\/108"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.systematicreviewsjournal.com\/content\/pdf\/2046-4053-3-108.pdf","pmid":"25248499","pubdate":"2014-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","startpage":"108","title":"Do sugar-sweetened beverages cause adverse health outcomes in adults?
