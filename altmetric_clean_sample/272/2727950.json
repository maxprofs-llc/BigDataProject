Fusion products contain DC-tumor fusion hybrids, unfused DCs and unfused tumor cells. Various fractions have been used in previous studies, including purified hybrids, the adherent cell fraction or the whole fusion mixture. The extent to which the hybrids themselves or other components are responsible for antitumor immunity or which components should be used to maximize the antitumor immunity remains unknown.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Zhang Y","Luo W","Wang Y","Liu Y","Zheng L"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0086772","first_seen_on":"2014-09-30T14:18:37+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1412086676,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24466232?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC3900640","pmid":"24466232","pubdate":"2014-01-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Purified dendritic cell-tumor fusion hybrids supplemented with non-adherent dendritic cells fraction are superior activators of antitumor immunity.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/purified-dendritic-celltumor-fusion-hybrids-supplemented-nonadherent-dendritic-cells-fraction-superi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4319462,"mean":4.962908095208,"rank":3405629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":125760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4319462,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116160,"mean":7.9510908151759,"rank":90708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116160,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77157,"mean":8.0152171963296,"rank":60643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":575,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77157,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2525,"mean":14.506774167987,"rank":2161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2525,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/status\/516955105724100609","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2727950],"posted_on":"2014-09-30T14:17:56+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
