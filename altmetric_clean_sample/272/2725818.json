This section continues the conversation initiated in Part I, documenting a legacy of struggle for an ergonomics standard through the voices of eight labor, academic, and government key informants. Part I summarized important components of the standard; described the convergence of labor activism, research, and government action that laid the foundation for a standard; and highlighted the debates that characterized the rulemaking process. Part II explores the anti-regulatory political landscape of the 1990s, as well as the key opponents, power dynamics, and legal maneuvers that led to repeal of the standard. This section also describes the impact of the ergonomics struggle beyond the standard itself and ends with a discussion of creative state-level policy initiatives and coalition approaches to prevent work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) in today's sociopolitical context.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f6100066ae","authors":["Delp L","Mojtahedi Z","Sheikh H","Lemus J"],"doi":"10.2190\/ns.24.3.j","first_seen_on":"2014-09-30T01:49:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1048-2911"],"issue":"3","journal":"New Solutions: A Journal of Environmental & Occupational Health Policy","last_mentioned_on":1411994700,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25261029"],"pmid":"25261029","pubdate":"2014-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","occupationalmedicine"],"title":"A Legacy of Struggle: The OSHA Ergonomics Standard and Beyond, Part II.","type":"article","volume":"24"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.176,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.176},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4309745,"mean":4.9743409911825,"rank":688592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3620375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4309745,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115977,"mean":7.9605534248467,"rank":23919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":92014,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115977,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":3.6796170212766,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":5.176,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"A legacy of struggle: the OSHA ergonomics standard and beyond, parts I and 2","url":"http:\/\/timallenmdjd.blogspot.com\/2014\/09\/a-legacy-of-struggle-osha-ergonomics.html","citation_ids":[2725817,2725818],"posted_on":"2014-09-29T12:45:00+00:00","summary":"New Solut.&nbsp;2014 Jan 1;24(3):365-89. doi: 10.2190\/NS.24.3.i.A legacy of struggle: the OSHA ergonomics standard and beyond, part I.Delp L1,&nbsp;Mojtahedi Z2,&nbsp;Sheikh H3,&nbsp;Lemus J4.Author information1APHA Occupational Health and Safety Section.2","author":{"name":"TimAllenMDJD","url":"http:\/\/timallenmdjd.blogspot.com\/","description":""}}]}}
