It can have many different meanings depending on the design of the educational method employed and the skills of the teacher. The many variables possible can produce wide variations in quality and in the educational objectives that can be achieved. A taxonomy is proposed to facilitate an awareness of these differences and to help teachers choose a problem-based learning method most appropriate for their students.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f610003094","authors":["H S Barrows"],"first_seen_on":"2014-09-29T01:28:01+00:00","issns":["0308-0110"],"issue":"6","journal":"Medical Education","last_mentioned_on":1413168135,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3796328"],"pmid":"3796328","pubdate":"1986-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["education"],"title":"A taxonomy of problem-based learning methods.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/taxonomy-problembased-learning-methods-12"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6389504,"mean":5.9012614467837,"rank":2084982,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4274241,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6389504,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150572,"mean":8.5503405569467,"rank":46387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":103217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150572,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":999,"mean":4.3480320641283,"rank":380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":600,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":999,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":6.7833333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":14,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Ph.
