Although they do not generate action potentials, they nonetheless exhibit electrical activity and can influence surrounding neurons through gliotransmitter release. In this work, we explored whether optogenetic activation of glial cells could act as an amplification mechanism to optical neural stimulation via gliotransmission to the neural network. We studied the modulation of gliotransmission by selective photo-activation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and by means of a matrix of individually addressable super-bright microLEDs (\u03bcLEDs) with an excitation peak at 470 nm. We combined Ca2+ imaging techniques and concurrent patch-clamp electrophysiology to obtain subsequent glia\/neural activity. First, we tested the \u03bcLEDs efficacy in stimulating ChR2-transfected astrocyte. ChR2-induced astrocytic current did not desensitize overtime, and was linearly increased and prolonged by increasing \u03bcLED irradiance in terms of intensity and surface illumination. Subsequently, ChR2 astrocytic stimulation by broad-field LED illumination with the same spectral profile, increased both glial cells and neuronal calcium transient frequency and sEPSCs suggesting that few ChR2-transfected astrocytes were able to excite surrounding not-ChR2-transfected astrocytes and neurons. Finally, by using the \u03bcLEDs array to selectively light stimulate ChR2 positive astrocytes we were able to increase the synaptic activity of single neurons surrounding it. In conclusion, ChR2-transfected astrocytes and \u03bcLEDs system were shown to be an amplifier of synaptic activity in mixed corticalneuronal and glial cells culture.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Rolando Berlinguer-Palmini","Roberto Narducci","Kamyar Merhan","Arianna Dilaghi","Flavio Moroni","Alessio Masi","Tania Scartabelli","Elisa Landucci","Maria Sili","Antonio Schettini","Brian McGovern","Pleun Maskaant","Patrick Degenaar","Guido Mannaioni"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0108689","first_seen_on":"2014-09-30T04:53:08+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1412052763,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0108689"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0108689.pdf","pmid":"25265500","pubdate":"2014-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e108689","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Arrays of MicroLEDs and Astrocytes: Biological Amplifiers to Optogenetically Modulate Neuronal Networks Reducing Light Requirement","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/arrays-microleds-astrocytes-biological-amplifiers-optogenetically-modulate-neuronal-networks-reducin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4314659,"mean":4.9673304634293,"rank":3404773,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":125480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4314659,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116061,"mean":7.9624411683613,"rank":90767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116061,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77060,"mean":8.0237604432967,"rank":60627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77060,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2523,"mean":14.393715305313,"rank":2163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2523,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
