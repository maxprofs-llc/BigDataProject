Moreover, 75\u00a0% of them would not feel comfortable being the first to bring up the subject. Our Gynaecological Advice Clinic was established in 2006 at the Christie Hospital and offers support to cancer patients who face sexuality issues. A previous evaluation established that the service sees approximately, 200 patients per year. The aims of this study are to evaluate the service by collecting data relating to levels of attendance, type and amount of clinical activity and to explore further patients' experiences and management.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002306","authors":["C Iavazzo","K Johnson","H Savage","S Gallagher","M Datta","B A Winter-Roach"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00404-014-3491-2","first_seen_on":"2014-09-28T10:26:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0711"],"journal":"Archives of Gynecology & Obstetrics","last_mentioned_on":1434449831,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25260989?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25260989"],"pmid":"25260989","pubdate":"2014-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Endocrinology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gynecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Obstetrics\/Perinatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Sexuality issues in gynaecological oncology patients: post treatment symptoms and therapeutic options.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sexuality-issues-gynaecological-oncology-patients-post-treatment-symptoms-therapeutic-options"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5228922,"mean":6.1649666082185,"rank":2769001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1778328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5228922,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142479,"mean":8.564275537276,"rank":73025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":53213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142479,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":688,"mean":2.1761018922853,"rank":253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":688,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":2.0725454545455,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
