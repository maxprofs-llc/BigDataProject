The standard treatment for axillary artery aneurysm has been surgical repair, but endovascular management of select aneurysms using stent grafts has become more prevalent with the development of endoluminal technology. We report the case of a 36-year old man with a spontaneous aneurysm in the axillary artery. He experienced a tingling sensation and intermittent pain in the left upper extremity and had no history of trauma to the axilla. We performed endovascular treatment [placement of a Viabahn stent graft (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA)] for a spontaneous aneurysm in the axillary artery. Following the procedure, his symptoms disappeared completely. After 6, 12 and 24 months, we carried out computed tomography angiography; all scans showed no complications. Now, the patient has no symptoms related to aneurysm in the axilla.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f6100077be","authors":["Sung Kyun Park","Jeong Kye Hwang","Sun Cheol Park","Sang Dong Kim"],"doi":"10.1093\/icvts\/ivu308","first_seen_on":"2014-10-01T00:15:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1569-9285"],"journal":"Interactive Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1412123163,"links":["http:\/\/icvts.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2014\/09\/20\/icvts.ivu308.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/icvts.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2014\/09\/20\/icvts.ivu308.full.pdf","pmid":"25246010","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","cardiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Endovascular treatment of a spontaneous aneurysm in the axillary artery","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endovascular-treatment-spontaneous-aneurysm-axillary-artery-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2085664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2383700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119702,"mean":8.1586313397551,"rank":50578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":68027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119702,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1067,"mean":1.0907673545966,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":893,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1067,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.6166666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cardio_vascular\/status\/517105283097960448","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2729500],"posted_on":"2014-10-01T00:14:41+00:00","author":{"name":"cardio vascular","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cardiovascular.md","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2789497278\/fe8a984954a9a29f17cace1c56dbf4ad_normal.jpeg","description":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cardio.vascular1","id_on_source":"cardio_vascular","tweeter_id":"225938541","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":508},"tweet_id":"517105283097960448"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rmirod\/status\/517108142560129024","license":"datasift","rt":["cardio_vascular"],"citation_ids":[2729500],"posted_on":"2014-10-01T00:26:03+00:00","author":{"name":"MiJay","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/525775685223067648\/-8OaLXcB_normal.jpeg","description":"Cmptr Sys Eng, ChristianConservative\nHigh Flight https:\/\/t.co\/zvphUXVszb\nTheme of life Amazing grace https:\/\/t.co\/jkX4KvOvrT #ripfrodo","id_on_source":"rmirod","tweeter_id":"22532718","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3138},"tweet_id":"517108142560129024"}]}}
