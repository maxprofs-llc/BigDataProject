Most of the videos came from cosmetic surgeons who appeared to be aggressively using social media in their practices. Except for videos that explained cosmetic surgery procedures, most videos in our sample emphasized the benefits of cosmetic surgery, and only a small number of the videos addressed the involved risks. We also found that tactics of persuasive communication-namely, related to message source and message sensation value (MSV)-have been used in Web-based social media to attract viewers' attention and interests. Expert sources were used predominantly, although typical-consumer sources tended to generate greater viewer interest in cosmetic surgery than other types of message sources. High MSV, moreover, was found to increase a video's popularity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f6100014ed","authors":["Nainan Wen","Stella C Chia","Xiaoming Hao"],"doi":"10.1080\/10410236.2014.913220","first_seen_on":"2014-09-27T10:19:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-7027","1041-0236"],"issue":"9","journal":"Health Communication","last_mentioned_on":1412448744,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25257243?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10410236.2014.913220"],"pmid":"25257243","pubdate":"2014-09-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Communication And Media Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","healthservices"],"title":"What Do Social Media Say About Makeovers?
