There is a lack of systematic research that can enrich our understanding of strategies to facilitate large system transformations in this sector. The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics of core activities and strategies to facilitate implementation and change of a national program aimed at improving life for the most ill elderly people in Sweden. The program outcomes were also addressed to assess the impact of these strategies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bb","doi":"10.1186\/1472-6963-14-401","first_seen_on":"2014-09-29T20:22:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1472-6963"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Health Services Research","last_mentioned_on":1420584373,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6963-14-401.pdf","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/14\/401"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6963-14-401.pdf","pmid":"25230774","pubdate":"2014-09-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Health Administration","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Informatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nursing Management\/Nursing Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"401","subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"Strategies to facilitate implementation and sustainability of large system transformations: a case study of a national program for improving quality of care for elderly people","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/strategies-facilitate-implementation-sustainability-large-system-transformations-case-study-national"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5230180,"mean":6.1634482609511,"rank":698072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":4530844,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5230180,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142113,"mean":8.5967700686783,"rank":23615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":118444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142113,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2290,"mean":4.6396810834426,"rank":309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":1980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2290,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":5.9669127516779,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
