In total, 2606 Finnish women aged 49 years responded to a postal questionnaire on lifestyle, quality of life, and health, wherein QoL was assessed with a shorter version of the menopause-specific Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ). Proportional odds ratios (PORs) from ordered logistic regression models were used to test the association between the physical-activity and WHQ domains or three quality-of-life variables. Physically inactive women had an increased probability of anxiety\/depressed mood (POR 1.44; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-1.65), of decreased well-being (POR 1.96; 95% CI 1.71-2.25), of somatic symptoms (POR 1.61; 95% CI 1.40-1.85), of memory\/concentration problems (POR 1.48; 95% CI 1.29-1.70), and of vasomotor symptoms (POR 1.19; 95% CI 1.03-1.36) as compared to physically active women. Women with the recommended level of physical activity had a higher self-perceived health level, better relative health, and better global quality of life in relation to other women their age. Physically active women showed higher quality of life in four menopause-specific WHQ dimensions and in global quality of life when compared to inactive women.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5013cf058f610003078","authors":["Kirsi Mansikkam\u00e4ki","Jani Raitanen","Nea Malila","Tytti Sarkeala","Satu M\u00e4nnist\u00f6","Jonna Fredman","Sirpa Hein\u00e4vaara","Riitta Luoto"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.maturitas.2014.09.009","first_seen_on":"2014-09-30T05:31:01+00:00","issns":["0378-5122","03785122"],"journal":"Maturitas","last_mentioned_on":1464440520,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.maturitas.org%2Farticle%2FS0378-5122%252814%252900296-5%2Fabstract&code=mat-site","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378512214002965","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.maturitas.org%2Farticle%2FS0378-5122%252814%252900296-5%2Ffulltext&code=mat-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.maturitas.org%2Farticle%2FS0378-5122%252814%252900296-5%2Ffulltext&code=mat-site","http:\/\/www.maturitas.org\/article\/S0378-5122%2814%2900296-5\/fulltext","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=7&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.maturitas.org%2Farticle%2FS0378-5122%252814%252900296-5%2Ffulltext&code=mat-site","http:\/\/www.maturitas.org\/article\/S0378-5122(14)00296-5\/fulltext","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25449820"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.maturitas.org\/article\/S0378512214002965\/pdf","pmid":"25449820","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Physical activity and menopause-related quality of life \u2013 A population-based cross-sectional study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physical-activity-menopauserelated-quality-life-populationbased-crosssectional-study-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":18,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":18},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029773,"mean":6.8058472945396,"rank":447142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7577770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029773,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195503,"mean":7.8281175230946,"rank":13946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":181469,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195503,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1358,"mean":5.2292483419307,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":1274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1358,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":13.727142857143,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
