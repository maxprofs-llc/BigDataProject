Prior to analysis of VOCs, breath samples are often collected with canisters or bags and concentrated. The Bio-VOC breath sampler, a commercial sampling device, has been recently introduced to the market with growing use. The main advantage for this sampler is to collect the last portion of exhaled breath, which is more likely to represent the air deep in the lungs. However, information about the Bio-VOC sampler is somewhat limited. Therefore, we have thoroughly evaluated the sampler here. We determined the volume of the breath air collected in the sampler was approximately 88 mL. When sampling was repeated multiple times, with the succeeding exhalations applied to a single sorbent tube, we observed linear relationships between the normalized peak intensity and the number of repeated collections with the sampler in many of the breath VOCs detected. No moisture effect was observed on the Tenax sorbent tubes used. However, due to the limitation in the collection volume, the use of the Bio-VOC sampler is recommended only for detection of VOCs present at high concentrations unless repeated collections of breath samples on the sampler are conducted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef742a83ee09648b51a1","authors":["Jae Kwak"],"doi":"10.3390\/metabo4040879","first_seen_on":"2014-09-29T14:25:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2218-1989",""],"issue":"4","journal":"Metabolites","last_mentioned_on":1412000687,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2218-1989\/4\/4\/879"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2218-1989\/4\/4\/879\/pdf","pmid":"25532709","pubdate":"2014-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Evaluation of Bio-VOC Sampler for Analysis of Volatile Organic Compoundss in Exhaled Breath","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-biovoc-sampler-analysis-volatile-organic-compounds-exhaled-breath"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4792156,"mean":5.7353843062291,"rank":3394859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":780275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4792156,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128817,"mean":8.6569332070552,"rank":87665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":25334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128817,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":1.9010869565217,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":3,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
