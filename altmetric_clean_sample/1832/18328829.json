Study Design (1) Examination of mucosal surface gene expression in human iLTS. (2) In vitro comparison of normal and scar laryngotracheal fibroblasts under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Setting Tertiary care hospital in a research university (2012-2016). Subjects and Methods Brush biopsies were obtained from normal laryngotracheal tissue and scar in iLTS patients; gene expression was compared. Fibroblasts were isolated from normal and scarred trachea and grown in vitro in either a 1% O2 or normoxic environment. Cell growth and gene and protein expression were compared. Statistical analysis utilized a multilevel mixed effects model. Results Expression of IL-6 (fold change = 2.8, P < .01), myofibroblast marker \u03b1SMA (fold change = 3.0, P = .01), and MMP13 (fold change = 5.4, P = .02) was significantly increased in scar biopsy samples as compared to normal. Under hypoxic conditions in vitro, normal laryngotracheal fibroblasts proliferated significantly faster (n = 8, P < .01 each day). Expression of IL-6 (n = 8, fold change = 2.6, P < .01) increased significantly after 12 hours under hypoxia. Expression of \u03b1SMA (n = 8, fold change= 2.0, P = .03), COL1 (n = 8, fold change = 1.1, P = .03), and MMP13 (n = 8, fold change = 1.6, P = .01) increased significantly after 48 hours under hypoxia. Scar fibroblasts also proliferated significantly faster under hypoxic conditions but did not display the same expression profile. Conclusion Human iLTS scar has a myofibroblast phenotype. Under hypoxic conditions in vitro, normal laryngotracheal fibroblasts can transdifferentiate into a similar phenotype. These changes may be mediated by IL-6, a fibrosis-related cytokine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c01","authors":["Yin, Linda X.","Motz, Kevin M.","Samad, Idris","Duvvuri, Madhavi","Murphy, Michael","Ding, Dacheng","Hillel, Alexander T."],"doi":"10.1177\/0194599817697049","first_seen_on":"2017-03-31T01:39:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0194-5998","1097-6817"],"journal":"Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1490928282,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28349784?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28349784","pubdate":"2017-03-31T22:23:03+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology","generalsurgery"],"title":"Fibroblasts in Hypoxic Conditions Mimic Laryngotracheal Stenosis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fibroblasts-hypoxic-conditions-mimic-laryngotracheal-stenosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":6404243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1147211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249550,"mean":13.214495197336,"rank":178803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":43082,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249550,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2073,"mean":4.7406988416988,"rank":1584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2073,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":3.3303191489362,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/847624266996527105","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18328829],"posted_on":"2017-03-31T01:39:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":413},"tweet_id":"847624266996527105"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/847640768478969857","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18328829],"posted_on":"2017-03-31T02:44:42+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":387},"tweet_id":"847640768478969857"}]}}
