Patients and Methods: From 2006 to 2015, 400 consecutive pancreatic head resections and pancreatectomies were performed and prospectively documented. This study analysed incidence, treatment and outcome of patients with PPH. Results: Incidence of PPH was 5.5\u200a% (n\u2009=\u200922). PPH occurred in a median of eight days after pancreatic surgery with an equal frequency of symptoms being caused by gastrointestinal bleeding (n\u2009=\u200911) and abdominal bleeding (n\u2009=\u200911). Postoperative pancreatic fistulas (POPF) were significantly more frequent in case of PPH (45\u200a% POPF in case of PPH vs. 20\u200a% POPF in case of no PPH, p\u2009<\u20090.01). PPH was more frequent after pancreatogastrostomy (8\/70; 11\u200a%) than after pancreatojejunostomy (11\/281; 4\u200a%; p\u2009=\u20090.01). The majority of bleedings after pancreatogastrostomy came from the intragastric cut surface of the pancreas. During the first week, relaparotomy was significantly more frequent (n\u2009=\u20095; 56\u200a%) than in late PPH (n\u2009=\u20091; 8\u200a%; p\u2009=\u20090.01). In late PPH, interventions (angiography; n\u2009=\u20097, endoscopy; n\u2009=\u20094) were more frequent. In 16 severe cases, surgical\/interventional bleeding control (n\u2009=\u200912) or relevant transfusions of more than 3 units of packed red blood cells (n\u2009=\u20094) were performed. Compared with the whole group, mortality was significantly increased in case of PPH (13.6\u200a% in case of PPH vs. 3.7\u200a% in case of no PPH; p\u2009=\u20090.03). Conclusion: PPH is an episodic and potentially life-threatening complication with an increased mortality rate, which is frequently associated with impaired healing of the pancreatic anastomosis. Diagnostic investigation and treatment of PPH requires an experienced surgical centre with a close cooperation with endoscopy and (interventional) radiology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008da3","authors":["Riediger, H","Kr\u00fcger, K","Makowiec, F","Adam, U","Krueger, C M"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0042-109978","first_seen_on":"2016-08-09T15:04:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1438-9592","0044-409X"],"journal":"Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Chirurgie","last_mentioned_on":1470755071,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27501072?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27501072","pubdate":"2016-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Symptomatik, Diagnostik, Therapie und Klassifikation von 22 Patienten mit Postpankreatektomie-H\u00e4morrhagien (PPH) in einer Serie von 400 konsekutiven Pankreaskopfresektionen und Pankreatektomien","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/symptoms-diagnostics-treatment-classification-22-patients-postpancreatectomy-haemorrhage-pph-series"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187659,"mean":6.9230329122133,"rank":7085757,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187659,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257442,"mean":11.980241298006,"rank":217400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257442,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134,"mean":1.2548270676692,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/763028190780493826","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10354138],"posted_on":"2016-08-09T15:04:31+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"763028190780493826"}]}}
