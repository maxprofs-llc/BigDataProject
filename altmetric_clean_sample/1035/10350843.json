Although NSAIDs are broadly used against inflammatory diseases, they have side effects including alimentary canal disorders, kidney damage, infection and cardiovascular disorders. Thus, it is necessary to elucidate the pathophysiological role of each PG in various diseases to develop better therapies with fewer and milder side effects. PGD2 is a PG that was identified in 1973 by Hamberg and is produced by the activities of cyclooxygenase and either hematopoietic or lipocalin-type PGD synthase. PGD2 exerts its physiological effects by stimulating two distinct G protein-coupled receptors, namely D prostanoid receptor (DP) and chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2). The physiological role of PGD2 remains controversial. Some studies have reported that PGD2 has bronchoconstrictory and pro-inflammatory effects inducing immune cell accumulation. In contrast, other groups have reported that PGD2 has anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the recruitment of dendritic cells and neutrophils. We have investigated the pathophysiological role of PGD2 using various disease models and reported on its anti-inflammatory actions. Here, we review the anti-inflammatory roles of PGD2 and the underlying mechanisms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f1f","authors":["Murata, Takahisa","Maehara, Toko"],"doi":"10.1292\/jvms.16-0347","first_seen_on":"2016-08-09T11:33:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1347-7439","0916-7250"],"journal":"Journal of Veterinary Medical Science","last_mentioned_on":1470759792,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27498997?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27498997","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Discovery of anti-inflammatory role of prostaglandin D<sub>2<\/sub>","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/discovery-antiinflammatory-role-prostaglandin-d2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187659,"mean":6.9230329122133,"rank":3857737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4147694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187659,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257443,"mean":11.980165046884,"rank":118591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":130334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257443,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1550,"mean":1.066214331827,"rank":230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":1280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1550,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.9375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
