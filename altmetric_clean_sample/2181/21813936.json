Intense pulsed light (IPL) is widely accepted as a treatment for skin rosacea. A number of recent studies demonstrated that, in patients suffering from meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), IPL therapy also reduces signs and symptoms of DED. Despite these encouraging results, in the context of DED and MGD, the mechanisms of action of IPL are not well understood. The purpose of this review was to raise the potential mechanisms of action and to discuss their plausibility.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f15","authors":["Steven J Dell"],"doi":"10.2147\/opth.s139894","first_seen_on":"2017-07-12T20:34:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1177-5483","1177-5467"],"journal":"Clinical Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1500375908,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/intense-pulsed-light-for-evaporative-dry-eye-disease-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-OPTH"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=37031","pmcid":"PMC5488788","pmid":"28790801","pubdate":"2017-06-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Intense pulsed light for evaporative dry eye disease","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intense-pulsed-light-evaporative-dry-eye-disease-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.4,"score_history":{"1y":4.4,"6m":4.4,"3m":4.4,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229472,"mean":6.9710874477773,"rank":1743529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6481576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229472,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191908,"mean":11.542901134404,"rank":50846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":140879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191908,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1285,"mean":2.6706292834891,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":1194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1285,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.665625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/clarion_vision\/statuses\/885235835129483264","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21813936],"posted_on":"2017-07-12T20:34:04+00:00","author":{"name":"ClarionVision","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/832675041988968448\/o3_iML7S_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"clarion_vision","tweeter_id":"3970299132","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":191},"tweet_id":"885235835129483264"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sandras51203129\/statuses\/885427901629444096","license":"gnip","rt":["clarion_vision"],"citation_ids":[21813936],"posted_on":"2017-07-13T09:17:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Sandra Scott","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/890622495807737856\/DTF8j9ip_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"sandras51203129","tweeter_id":"3929593161","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":55},"tweet_id":"885427901629444096"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Bryan_Gosse\/statuses\/886617658744897536","license":"gnip","rt":["clarion_vision"],"citation_ids":[21813936],"posted_on":"2017-07-16T16:04:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Bryan Gosse","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"Bryan_Gosse","tweeter_id":"783704181458677760","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":30},"tweet_id":"886617658744897536"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LingSusanE\/statuses\/886726767045750784","license":"gnip","rt":["clarion_vision"],"citation_ids":[21813936],"posted_on":"2017-07-16T23:18:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Susan Ling","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/746528655195529217\/BvPMFxUx_normal.jpg","description":"Registered Nurse, laser Gynecology treatments, Lumenis Fem Touch , urology, laser rejuvenation, aesthetics,  \n(Best job ever---grandma  of 3),","id_on_source":"LingSusanE","tweeter_id":"743861822978035712","geo":{"lt":43.25011,"ln":-79.84963,"country":"CA"},"followers":293},"tweet_id":"886726767045750784"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LFerre2015\/statuses\/887266983661760512","license":"gnip","rt":["clarion_vision"],"citation_ids":[21813936],"posted_on":"2017-07-18T11:05:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Luis Ferre","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/651019718124552192\/JKvLSjBN_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"LFerre2015","tweeter_id":"3871160361","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":63},"tweet_id":"887266983661760512"}]}}
