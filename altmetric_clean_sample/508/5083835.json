The effects of initial pH on the rate of NO3(-) reduction and the Fe(0) surface characteristics revealed Fe(2+)aq and the characteristics of minerals on the surface of Fe(0) played an important role in NO3(-) reduction. Both NO3(-) reduction and the decrease of Fe(2+)aq exhibited similar kinetics and were promoted by each other. This promotion was associated with the types of the surface iron oxides of Fe(0). Additionally, further reduction of NO3(-) produced more surface iron oxides, supplying more active sites for Fe(2+)aq, resulting in more electron transfer between Fe(2+) and surface iron oxides and a higher reaction rate. Using the isotope specificity of (57)Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy, it was verified that the Fe(2+)aq was continuously converted into Fe(3+) oxides on the surface of Fe(0) and then converted into Fe3O4 via electron transfer between Fe(2+) and the pre-existing surface Fe(3+) oxides. Electrochemistry measurements confirmed that the spontaneous electron transfer between the Fe(2+) and structural Fe(3+) species accelerated the interfacial electron transfer between the Fe species and NO3(-). This study provides a new insight into the interaction between Fe species and contaminants and interface electron transfer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dcc","authors":["Han, Luchao","Yang, Li","Wang, Haibo","Hu, Xuexiang","Chen, Zhan","Hu, Chun"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jhazmat.2016.01.047","first_seen_on":"2016-02-03T12:27:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-3336"],"journal":"Journal of Hazardous Materials","last_mentioned_on":1454502454,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26835898?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26835898","pubdate":"2016-02-03T22:00:33+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Sustaining reactivity of Fe(0) for nitrate reduction via electron transfer between dissolved Fe(2+) and surface iron oxides.","type":"article","volume":"308","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sustaining-reactivity-fe0-nitrate-reduction-via-electron-transfer-between-dissolved-fe2-surface-iron"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7089314,"mean":6.2945947100909,"rank":3537785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2038306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7089314,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319703,"mean":9.3794072354877,"rank":167275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":117584,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319703,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":889,"mean":2.2817927927928,"rank":336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":889,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":3.0751063829787,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
