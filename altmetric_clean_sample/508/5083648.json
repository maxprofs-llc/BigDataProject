Complications specific to graft- PCI include no-reflow, distal embolization, stent restenosis and thrombosis. Graft perforation during PCI is a rare coomplication of the procedure. Published literature on the predictors of perforation and management strategy remains limited to anecdotal cases.\nIn this review we collected data on all cases of graft perforations reported in PubMed\/Medline from 1987 to 2015.\n37 cases of graft perforation were reported. High risk grafts for perforations included, old grafts (14\u00b17.8years) with more than 80% luminal stenosis. Perforations were noted after use of different cardiac devices and included stent placement (30%, N=11), balloon angioplasty (36%, N=14), post-dilation with non complaint balloon (16%, N=6), guide wire perforation (1 case), post IVUS imaging (1 case) and one case after use of thrombus extraction device. Average stent diameter of 3.7\u00b10.7 mm, average balloon pressure of 15.5\u00b15 atm and 3 or more balloon inflations commonly resulted in graft perforation. 78% of cases reported class III perforation. Covered stent implantation was strongly associated with controlling acute bleed after graft perforation than prolonged balloon inflation (p=0.0001). Majority of cases reported using covered stents (81%). Average stent diameter of 3.9\u00b10.7mm, average stent length of 18.5\u00b16mm and the average deployment pressure of 14\u00b12atm were reported to be effective in controlling the bleed. 95% of the patients did well post procedure and with prolonged hospitalization (8\u00b14days). 24% of cases reported cardiac tamponade causing hemodynamic compromise including 2 peri-procedural deaths.\nGraft perforation can be effectively treated with covered stent grafts with good immediate results, short term outcome and acceptable peri-procedural risks.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024b1","authors":["Chowdhury, Mohammed Andaleeb","Sheikh, Mujeeb Abdul","Mohammed Andaleeb Chowdhury","Mujeeb Abdul Sheikh"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.carrev.2015.11.004","first_seen_on":"2016-02-03T12:19:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-0938","1553-8389"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1457461284,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26831902","http:\/\/www.cardiorevascmed.com\/article\/S1553-8389(15)00301-2\/abstract"],"pmid":"26831902","pubdate":"2016-02-03T22:01:56+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Coronary bypass graft perforation during percutaneous intervention.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coronary-bypass-graft-perforation-during-percutaneous-intervention"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440707,"mean":7.0976540016831,"rank":4262471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3959887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440707,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":336067,"mean":9.690012479691,"rank":163302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":160027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":336067,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":1.8466875,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":99,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":0.58421052631579,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/drtars\/statuses\/694857581085466624","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5083648],"posted_on":"2016-02-03T12:18:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Tars the Robot","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_6_normal.png","id_on_source":"drtars","tweeter_id":"3982165613","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":10},"tweet_id":"694857581085466624"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CRT_meeting\/statuses\/707268699112218624","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5083648],"posted_on":"2016-03-08T18:16:12+00:00","author":{"name":"CRT Meeting","url":"http:\/\/crtmeeting.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/836959735047938053\/-3deUJNh_normal.jpg","description":"#CRT2017 is an interventional cardiology meeting comprised of concurrent meetings in six areas of interest.
