A series of logistic regression analyses were conducted with a sample of 11,163 respondents aged 50+ from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health to determine the degree to which the direct association between COPD and GAD was attenuated by socio-demographic factors, social support, health behaviors, sleep problems, pain, functional limitations, and early childhood adversities. Additional analyses were completed using the sub-sample of those diagnosed with COPD (n = 746) to determine predictors of GAD. One in 17 (5.8%) of older individuals with COPD had past-year GAD, in comparison to 1.7% of those without (p < .001). The age-sex-race adjusted odds of GAD were four times higher for those with COPD compared to those without COPD (OR = 3.90, 95%CI: 2.64, 5.77). After full adjustment for 18 characteristics, these odds declined to 1.72 (95%CI: 1.10, 2.71). Factors associated with GAD among those with COPD include not having a confidant (OR = 7.85, 95%CI: 3.47, 17.75), exposure to parental domestic violence (OR = 5.63, 95% CI: 2.07, 15.34) and lifetime depressive disorders (OR = 3.59, 95% CI:1.61,7.98). Those with COPD have substantially higher odds of GAD even after most known risk factors for GAD are accounted for. These findings have implications for targeted outreach and screening, particularly for patients with pain and functional limitations. The importance of a multidisciplinary healthcare team is underscored by the multiple issues that may impact GAD among COPD patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5223cf058f610003af5","authors":["Esme Fuller-Thomson","Ashley Lacombe-Duncan"],"doi":"10.3109\/15412555.2015.1132691","endpage":"10","first_seen_on":"2016-02-03T14:53:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1541-2555","1541-2563"],"journal":"COPD: Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","last_mentioned_on":1494529408,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/eprint\/3yBcKVYUsiMtdth2Ynwy\/full","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3109\/15412555.2015.1132691","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/15412555.2015.1132691?journalCode=icop20","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/15412555.2015.1132691?tokenDomain=eprints&tokenAccess=3yBcKVYUsiMtdth2Ynwy&forwardService=showFullText&doi=10.3109%2F15412555.2015.1132691&doi=10.3109%2F15412555.2015.1132691&journalCode=icop20#.VwxQe3rLnrs","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.3109\/15412555.2015.1132691","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3109\/15412555.2015.1132691?journalCode=icop20"],"pmid":"26830204","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Understanding the Association Between Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Current Anxiety: A Population-Based Study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/understanding-association-between-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-current-anxiety-populationba-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":99.806,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":99.806},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187776,"mean":6.9233436649085,"rank":82208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8105586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187776,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":333213,"mean":9.6509042831587,"rank":5876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":327337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":333213,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":355,"mean":2.7867457627119,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":355,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.109375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"SA":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Anxiety disorder 3 times more likely among older adults with COPD","url":"http:\/\/feedproxy.google.com\/~r\/healthtopicstoday\/~3\/kVPxviZ1CRE\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[5084826],"posted_on":"2016-02-04T11:07:59+00:00","summary":"The prevalence of past-year generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) for adults aged 50 and older with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is much higher compared to older adults without COPD (5.8% vs 1.7%), according to a new study published by\u2026","author":{"name":"Today Topics ","url":"http:\/\/www.todaytopics.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/290\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2014-11-27_at_12.02.15.png?1417089747"}},{"title":"Anxiety disorder 3 times more likely among older adults with COPD","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=25336205999&p=1pl&v=1&x=j-372ruF7hyJuwWHQUAHRQ","license":"public","citation_ids":[5084826,5084826],"posted_on":"2016-02-03T05:00:00+00:00","summary":"Toronto, ON -
