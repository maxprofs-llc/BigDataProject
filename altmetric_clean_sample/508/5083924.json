DNDi has promoted overall drug discovery research including the screening of drug candidates, hit to lead, lead optimization, pre-clinical and clinical studies in the area of infectious diseases with a focus on malaria, sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis; HAT), Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, filarial diseases and pediatric formulations for HIV treatment. DNDi's achievements include the development of novel therapies based on patient needs through innovative partnerships with over 130 organizations in industry, government, academia, and public institutions around the world. To date, DNDi has registered 6 novel treatments adapted to the needs of patients in poor countries, and has another 12 novel entities in development. DNDi Japan is a Japanese non-profit organization (NPO) based on the global principles of DNDi and, as the only PDP in Japan, is supporting NTD drug discovery projects in collaboration with Japanese pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions and government agencies by utilizing Japan's excellent R&D capabilities to develop new treatments for NTDs in order to contribute to global health.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d2e","authors":["Yamada, Haruki","Hirabayashi, Fumiko","Br\u00fcnger, Chris"],"doi":"10.1248\/yakushi.15-00233-2","first_seen_on":"2016-02-03T12:32:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1347-5231"],"issue":"2","journal":"Yakugaku Zasshi = Journal of Pharmaceutical Society of Japan","last_mentioned_on":1454502699,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26831796?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26831796","pubdate":"2016-02-03T22:02:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacy","pharmacology"],"title":"International Partnership for Therapeutic Drug Development of NTDs by DNDi.","type":"article","volume":"136","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/international-partnership-therapeutic-drug-development-ntds-dndi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7089314,"mean":6.2945947100909,"rank":6097714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7089314,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319703,"mean":9.3794228750521,"rank":264029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319703,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":484,"mean":1.6555072463768,"rank":385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":484,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":1.1066842105263,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
