When liberated from membrane phospholipids, AA can be oxidized to a variety of eicosanoids, compounds important in cell-cell signaling. Dietary n-3 PUFA have been effectively used to attenuate tissue AA levels and subsequent eicosanoid formation. However, only recently have the effects of dietary AA been investigated. This review discusses the antagonistic effects of dietary AA and n-3 PUFA, eicosanoid formation and the evidence suggesting divergent effects with regard to circulating triglycerides, beta-oxidation and tumor necrosis factor.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8d","authors":["Jay Whelan"],"first_seen_on":"2016-02-03T19:59:55+00:00","issns":["0022-3166","1541-6100"],"issue":"4 Suppl","journal":"Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1330631640,"links":["http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/cgi\/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8642438"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/126\/4_Suppl\/1086S.full.pdf","pmid":"8642438","pubdate":"1996-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Antagonistic Effects of Dietary Arachidonic Acid and n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids","type":"article","volume":"126","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antagonistic-effects-dietary-arachidonic-acid-n3-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4709491,"mean":5.7134254706999,"rank":495084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":4184489,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4709491,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94014,"mean":8.2267464074119,"rank":11667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":82204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94014,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3023,"mean":8.7520734612839,"rank":622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3023,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":12.935515151515,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
