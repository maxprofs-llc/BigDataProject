Furthermore, individuals with BPD also display higher sexual identity disturbances and homosexual relationships than non-BPD individuals. Moreover, patients with BPD also exhibit higher sexual impulsivity than non-BPD. In addition, sexual risk behaviours among individuals with BPD are related to increased rates of sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancies, rape and commercial sexual relationships, especially among drug abusers. Although psychotherapy is widely recommended for BPD, there has been little systematic research on the effect of these treatments with respect to co-morbid post-traumatic symptoms related to childhood sexual trauma.\nSexuality-related issues represent a major clinical topic within this population. Findings are discussed concerning their methodological limitations and clinical implications.
