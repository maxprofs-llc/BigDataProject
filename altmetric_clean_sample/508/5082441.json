Due to the chronic nature of asthma, potentially negative side effects of long-term use of allopathic medications, and desire for natural approaches, patients and their families turn toward complementary therapies. Up to 89% of parents use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to treat their child's asthma. This article reviews the current evidence on the most commonly used complementary therapies for pediatric asthma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007081","authors":["Sanghamitra M.
