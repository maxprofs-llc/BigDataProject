PCR analysis for Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., Rickettsia spp., and Anaplasma phagocytophilum yielded negative results for all I. vespertilionis. DNA of Rickettsia helvetica was detected in three specimens of I. ricinus attached to Rhinolophus hipposideros or Myotis myotis, while Borrelia garinii was found in one tick parasitizing Myotis daubentonii. These pathogens were recorded for the first time in hard ticks that parasitized bats.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003294","authors":["Piksa, Krzysztof","Sta\u0144czak, Joanna","Biernat, Beata","G\u00f3rz, Andrzej","Nowak-Chmura, Magdalena","Siuda, Krzysztof"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00436-016-4936-2","first_seen_on":"2016-02-03T12:34:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-1955","0932-0113"],"issue":"4","journal":"Parasitology Research","last_mentioned_on":1458915188,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26833325?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26833325\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26833325","http:\/\/paperity.org\/p\/75335842\/detection-of-borrelia-burgdorferi-sensu-lato-and-spotted-fever-group-rickettsiae-in-hard","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26833325"],"pmid":"26833325","pubdate":"2016-02-03T22:01:28+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Detection of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and spotted fever group rickettsiae in hard ticks (Acari, Ixodidae) parasitizing bats in Poland","type":"article","volume":"115","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detection-borrelia-burgdorferi-sensu-lato-spotted-fever-group-rickettsiae-hard-ticks-acari-ixodidae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7438587,"mean":6.4662340552314,"rank":1531209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5857793,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7438587,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":323728,"mean":9.4877920408242,"rank":82483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":240259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":323728,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1576,"mean":2.0741193650794,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":1435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1576,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":1.6884266666667,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1,"NO":1,"ES":1},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/batpapers\/statuses\/694861421666922496","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5083950],"posted_on":"2016-02-03T12:34:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Bat_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/868693472189890561\/su_GIZCP_normal.jpg","description":"Tweets papers and preprints related to #bats #ecology #animalBehavior from #PubMed #Biorxiv.
