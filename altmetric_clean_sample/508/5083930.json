LFTs use a premix format for a rapid one-step delivery of premixed sample and labeled antibody to the detection region. We have compared the signal characteristics of two types of reagent delivery formats in a model system of a sandwich immunoassay for malarial protein detection. The premix format produced a uniform binding profile within the detection region. In contrast, decoupling the delivery of sample and labeled antibody to the detection region in a sequential format produced a nonuniform binding profile in which the majority of the signal was localized to the upstream edge of the detection region. The assay response was characterized in both the sequential and premix formats. The sequential format had a 4- to 10-fold lower limit of detection than the premix format, depending on assay conjugate concentration. A mathematical model of the assay quantitatively reproduced the experimental binding profiles for a set of rate constants that were consistent with surface plasmon resonance measurements and absorbance measurements of the experimental multivalent malaria system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Liang, Tinny","Robinson, Robert","Houghtaling, Jared","Fridley, Gina","Ramsey, Stephen A","Fu, Elain"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.analchem.5b04222","first_seen_on":"2016-02-03T12:32:16+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["1520-6882"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1454502705,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26835721?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26835721","pubdate":"2016-02-03T22:00:35+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Investigation of Reagent Delivery Formats in a Multivalent Malaria Sandwich Immunoassay and Implications for Assay Performance.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/investigation-reagent-delivery-formats-multivalent-malaria-sandwich-immunoassay-implications-assay-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7089314,"mean":6.2945947100909,"rank":6097714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7089314,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319703,"mean":9.3794220930739,"rank":264029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319703,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6314,"mean":3.328466972913,"rank":5314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6314,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167,"mean":8.7467710843373,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
