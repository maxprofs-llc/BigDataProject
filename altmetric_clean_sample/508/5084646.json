Among the 107 cirrhotic patients, 56 were classified as group 1, 25 as group 2, and 26 as group 3 according to the absence, the presence of minimal, and the presence of massive ascites, respectively. The scores of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) were matched between groups as the standard reference. The liver ADC, spleen ADC, and normalized liver ADC values were compared between the control group and patients' groups.\nPatients with massive ascites had significantly higher MELD score compared with the other groups. The MELD score was also significantly higher in patient groups than in control group. The liver and normalized liver ADCs of patients' groups were significantly lower than that of the control group. With some overlap among groups, the measured ADC values decreased as the amount of the ascites increased, and these relationships were statistically significant. Furthermore, compared to control group, patients with massive ascites had significantly higher spleen ADCs.\nOur results indicate that the ADC value of the liver and spleen correlates with the presence and the degree of ascites in patients with chronic liver disease, and merits further study.","authors":["Kahraman, Aysegul Sagir","Kahraman, Bayram","Ozdemir, Zeynep Maras","Gormeli, Cemile Ayse","Ozdemir, Fatih","Dogan, Metin"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00261-015-0613-7","first_seen_on":"2016-02-03T14:08:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2366-0058"],"issue":"1","journal":"Abdominal radiology","last_mentioned_on":1454508488,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26830612?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26830612","pubdate":"2016-02-03T22:02:30+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hepatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the liver in assessing chronic liver disease: effects of the presence and the degree of ascites on ADC values.","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diffusionweighted-imaging-dwi-liver-assessing-chronic-liver-disease-effects-presence-degree-ascites"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
