The primary outcome measure was withholding or withdrawal of intensive care in the delivery room.\nAmong infants born alive at 22-23\u2005weeks, intensive care was withheld or withdrawn for >90%. At 24\u2005weeks, resuscitative measures were withheld or withdrawn for 38%, at 25\u2005weeks for 8% and at 26\u2005weeks for 3%. Other factors besides gestational age at birth associated with this withholding or withdrawal for infants born at 24-26\u2005weeks were birth weight <600\u2005g, emergency delivery (within 24\u2005h of the mother's admission) and singleton pregnancy. Although rates of withholding or withdrawal of intensive care varied substantially between maternity units (from 0% to 100%), the variability was primarily explained by differences in distributions of gestational age at birth.\nAlthough gestational age is only one factor predicting survival of preterm infants, practices in France appear to be based primarily on this factor, which thus has direct effects on the survival of extremely preterm infants. The ethical implications of basing life and death decisions only on gestational age before 25\u2005weeks require further examination.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002304","authors":["J Perlbarg","P Y Ancel","B Khoshnood","M Durox","P Boileau","M Garel","M Kaminski","F Goffinet","L Foix-L'H\u00e9lias","the Epipage-2 Ethics group","Pierre Kuhn","Bruno Langer","Nadia Mazille","B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Lecomte","Anne Bellot","Peggy Dupont-Chauvet","Pierre Betremieux","Alain Beuch\u00e9e","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Charlot","Florence Rouget","G\u00e9rard Thiriez","Olivia Anselem","Elie Azria","Laurence Boujenah","Laurence Caeymaex","Pierre-Henri Jarreau","Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Magny","Mostafa Mokhtari","Aur\u00e9lien Jacquot","Anne Lema\u00eetre","Caroline Miler","Rachel Vieux","Catherine Arnaud","Patrick Truffert","Umberto Simeoni","Claude Bouderlique-Collin","Anne Chauty","Christophe Savagner","Olivier Claris","Ana\u00eblle Coquelin"],"doi":"10.1136\/archdischild-2015-308728","endpage":"F390","first_seen_on":"2016-02-03T17:38:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1468-2052","1359-2998"],"issue":"5","journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood -- Fetal & Neonatal Edition","last_mentioned_on":1503115193,"links":["http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/02\/02\/archdischild-2015-308728.abstract","http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/02\/02\/archdischild-2015-308728.long","http:\/\/fnbeta.bmj.com\/content\/101\/5\/F384","http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/content\/101\/5\/F384.long","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/archdischild-2015-308728"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/02\/02\/archdischild-2015-308728.full.pdf","pmid":"26837310","pubdate":"2016-02-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"fetalneonatal-2015-308728","subjects":["perinatology","pediatrics"],"title":"Delivery room management of extremely preterm infants: the EPIPAGE-2 study","type":"article","volume":"101","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/delivery-room-management-extremely-preterm-infants-epipage2-study-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.75,"score_history":{"1y":8.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":1040614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7353711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":335722,"mean":9.6787387622456,"rank":52618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":282924,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":335722,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":946,"mean":5.6795619047619,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":946,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":8.5093939393939,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":8,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MY":1,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ktconsultsglbl\/statuses\/694935892247519232","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5085680],"posted_on":"2016-02-03T17:30:02+00:00","author":{"name":"KT CONSULTS GLOBAL","url":"http:\/\/www.ktconsultsglobal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/666888625431314434\/hZ8hKhVN_normal.png","description":"Critical Care FTs & Absts conveying progressive practice trends & possibilities.
