This is a matter of some controversy, with some investigators reporting reduced type I interferon (IFN) synthesis while others suggest that type I IFN synthesis is relatively normal in asthma. The objective of this study was to examine the responsiveness of circulating mononuclear cells to HRV in a large cohort of participants with poorly controlled asthma and determine whether IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 synthesis varies across different inflammatory phenotypes.\nEligible adults with asthma (n=86) underwent clinical assessment, sputum induction and blood sampling. Asthma inflammatory subtypes were defined by sputum cell count, and supernatant assessed for IL-1\u03b2. PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) were exposed to HRV serotype 1b and IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 release was measured by ELISA.\nParticipants (mean age of 59 years, atopy 76%) had sub-optimal asthma control (mean ACQ6 1.7). In those with neutrophilic asthma (n=12), HRV1b stimulated PBMC produced significantly less IFN-\u03b1 than PBMC from participants with eosinophilic (n=35) and paucigranulocytic asthma (n=35). Sputum neutrophil proportion and the dose of inhaled corticosteroids were independent predictors of reduced IFN-\u03b1 production following HRV1b exposure.\nAnti-viral type I IFN production is impaired in those with neutrophilic airway inflammation and in those prescribed high doses of ICS. Our study is therefore an important step towards identifying those with poorly controlled asthma that might respond best to inhaled IFN therapy during exacerbations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024fa","authors":["Simpson, Jodie L","Carroll, Melanie","Yang, Ian A","Reynolds, Paul N","Hodge, Sandra","James, Alan L","Gibson, Peter G","Upham, John W","Jodie L.
