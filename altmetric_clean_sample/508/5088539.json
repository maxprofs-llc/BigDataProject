We aimed to evaluate the associations between polymorphisms of IL-27 gene and pre-eclampsia susceptibility in Han Chinese women.\n663 pregnant women were enrolled in a case-control study (212 cases and 451 normal pregnancies). The rs153109 and rs17855750 variants were discriminated using Polymerase Chain Reaction - Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods.\nA significantly reduced risk of pre-eclampsia was observed in the rs153109 GG genotype compared with the AA or AA\/AG genotypes (GG versus AA: OR\u00a0=\u00a00.51, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.30-0.86; GG versus\nOR\u00a0=\u00a00.60, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.37-0.98). Significantly reduced pre-eclampsia susceptibility was also associated with the AG\/GG genotypes of rs153109 (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.68, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.49-0.94) in dominant model. After stratification analysis, the different distribution of AG\/GG genotypes was particular significant in the severe pre-eclampsia subgroup (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.65, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.45-0.92) and the early-onset severe pre-eclampsia subgroup (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.51, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.30-0.87). Additionally, significantly increased mild pre-eclampsia risk was observed associated with rs17855750 GT\/GG and GT genotypes when compared with TT and TT\/GG genotypes (GT\/GG versus TT: OR\u00a0=\u00a02.27, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.12-4.55; GT versus TT\/GG: OR\u00a0=\u00a02.56, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.28-5.26).\nIt is biologically plausible that SNPs in IL-27 may have effect on individual susceptibility to pre-eclampsia. The results suggest the presence IL-27 rs153109, rs17855750 variants may be able to be used as markers for the genetic susceptibility to pre-eclampsia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008eed","authors":["Chen, Peng","Gong, Yunhui","Pu, Yan","Wang, Yanyun","Zhou, Bin","Song, Yaping","Wang, Tao","Zhang, Lin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.placenta.2015.11.003","first_seen_on":"2016-02-04T03:51:48+00:00","issns":["1532-3102"],"journal":"Placenta","last_mentioned_on":1454557891,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26654512"],"pmid":"26654512","pubdate":"2016-02-04T23:27:51+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["obstetrics","embryology","physiology"],"title":"Association between polymorphisms in IL-27 gene and pre-eclampsia.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-polymorphisms-il27-gene-preeclampsia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7099316,"mean":6.2990871854507,"rank":3546565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2039268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7099316,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318982,"mean":9.3833324806177,"rank":166965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":117259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318982,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":870,"mean":1.9093072497123,"rank":239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":870,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":0.79305555555556,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/114a3a310e8c44f\/statuses\/695092293963898880","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5088539],"posted_on":"2016-02-04T03:51:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Rina Puspita Said","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/624893027174084609\/UGibmMl6_normal.jpg","description":"unpad, unsri, ui","id_on_source":"114a3a310e8c44f","tweeter_id":"3238599960","followers":6},"tweet_id":"695092293963898880"}]}}
