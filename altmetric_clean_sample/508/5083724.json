Little is known about its epidemiology and long-term prognosis. Our aims are to determine the prevalence, predictors and outcomes of AFL-TCM.\nA total of 1269 patients were referred for radiofrequency ablation of AFL between January 1996 and September 2014; 184 had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF <40%). At 6\u2009months after AFL ablation, 103 patients (8.1% of the population, 56% of patients with baseline LVEF <40%) had marked LVEF improvement: these were considered to have AFL-TCM. Patients with persisting reduced LVEF were considered to have systolic dysfunction unrelated to AFL. Patients were followed for a median (percentile25-75 ) of 1.15 (0.4-2.8) years.\nPatients with AFL-TCM were younger, had lower prevalence of ischaemic cardiomyopathy and used less antiarrhythmic drugs than patients with systolic dysfunction unrelated to AFL. In multivariable analysis, ischemic cardiomyopathy [odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20090.32 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15-0.68) P\u2009=\u20090.003] and prescription of antiarrhythmic drug before ablation [OR\u2009=\u20090.41, 95% CI 0.20-0.84, P\u2009=\u20090.02] were significantly associated with a lower probability of LVEF improvement during follow-up. Patients with AFL-TCM had similar survival to patients without systolic dysfunction at baseline [hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20090.96 95% CI 0.34-2.65, P\u2009=\u20090.929], whereas patients with systolic dysfunction unrelated to AFL had higher mortality rates compared with patients without systolic dysfunction at baseline [HR\u2009=\u20092.88 95% CI 1.45-5.72, P\u2009=\u20090.002].\nMarked LVEF improvement was observed in 56% of patients with baseline LVEF <40% at 6\u2009months after ablation. These patients had similar survival to patients without baseline systolic dysfunction, whereas patients who remained with LVEF <40% had a threefold increase in mortality rates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c52","authors":["Brembilla-Perrot, B\u00e9atrice","Ferreira, Jo\u00e3o Pedro","Manenti, Vladimir","Sellal, Jean Marc","Olivier, Arnaud","Villemin, Thibaut","Beurrier, Daniel","De Chillou, Christian","Louis, Pierre","Brembilla, Alice","Juilli\u00e8re, Yves","Girerd, Nicolas","Brembilla\u2010Perrot, B\u00e9atrice"],"doi":"10.1002\/ejhf.482","first_seen_on":"2016-02-03T12:21:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0844"],"issue":"4","journal":"European Journal of Heart Failure","last_mentioned_on":1464220800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26833591?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/ejhf.482"],"pmid":"26833591","pubdate":"2016-02-03T22:01:20+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Predictors and prognostic significance of tachycardiomyopathy: insights from a cohort of 1269 patients undergoing atrial flutter ablation.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predictors-prognostic-significance-tachycardiomyopathy-insights-cohort-1269-patients-undergoing-atri"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7757128,"mean":6.6329627680391,"rank":3805768,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3753561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7757128,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":328488,"mean":9.5100094493841,"rank":159559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":156570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":328488,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":726,"mean":6.1337131034483,"rank":339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":726,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":9.5,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/726114261","license":"public","citation_ids":[5083724],"posted_on":"2016-05-26T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["confirmation"],"f1000_score":"3"}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CardiologiaF\/statuses\/694858157793763328","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5083724],"posted_on":"2016-02-03T12:21:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Cardiolog\u00eda-Fabumed","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1561758151\/fabumed_normal.png","description":"Cardiolog\u00eda.
