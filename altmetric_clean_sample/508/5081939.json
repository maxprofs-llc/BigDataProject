We have determined molecular mechanics force field parameters compatible with the CHARMM36 all-atom additive force field for all these modifications using the CHARMM force field parametrization strategy. Emphasis was placed on fine tuning of the partial atomic charges and torsion angle parameters. Quantum mechanics calculations on model compounds provided the initial set of target data, and extensive molecular dynamics simulations of nucleotides and oligonucleotides in aqueous solutions were used for further refinement against experimental data. The presented parameters will allow for computational studies of a wide range of RNAs containing modified nucleotides, including the ribosome and transfer RNAs. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fa6","authors":["Xu, You","Vanommeslaeghe, Kenno","Aleksandrov, Alexey","MacKerell, Alexander D.","Nilsson, Lennart"],"doi":"10.1002\/jcc.24307","endpage":"912","first_seen_on":"2016-02-03T07:55:51+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1096-987X"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Computational Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1454693570,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/jcc.24307&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26841080?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jcc.24307\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jcc.24307\/pdf","pmid":"26841080","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
