MiR-26b was reported to be significantly downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the underlying mechanisms of miR-26b involvement in the development and progression of NSCLC remains poorly understood. In the present study, we report that miR-26b suppresses cell metastasis in NSCLC through targeting migration and invasion enhancer 1 (MIEN1). We found that miR-26b was significantly downregulated and MIEN1 was significantly upregulated in both NSCLC tissues and cells lines. The expression levels of miR-26b were negatively related to those of MIEN1 mRNA in clinical NSCLC tissues. Furthermore, MIEN1 was confirmed to be a direct target of miR-26b by dual-luciferase reporter assay and MIEN1 expression was downregulated by miR-26b in NSCLC cells. In terms of function, transwell and wound healing assays demonstrated that the miR-26b remarkably inhibited invasion and migration of NSCLC cells, which was simulated by siRNA knockdown of MIEN1 and reversed by pcDNA\/MIEN1 overexpression of MIEN1. Finally, we found that miR-26b could regulate NF-\u03baB\/MMP-9\/VEGF pathway in NSCLC cells. In conclusion, this study revealed that miR-26b suppresses NSCLC metastasis by targeting MIEN1 via NF-\u03baB\/MMP-9\/VEGF pathways, implicating a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for NSCLC treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Li, Dongmei","Wei, Yucheng","Wang, Dong","Gao, Huijiang","Liu, Kui"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2016.01.163","first_seen_on":"2016-02-02T21:51:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1090-2104","0006291X"],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1454647378,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26827826?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006291X16301632"],"pmid":"26827826","pubdate":"2016-02-02T22:00:50+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"MicroRNA-26b suppresses the metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer by targeting MIEN1 via NF-\u03baB\/MMP-9\/VEGF pathways.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna26b-suppresses-metastasis-nonsmall-cell-lung-cancer-targeting-mien1-via-nf%CE%BAbmmp9vegf-pathway"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7103144,"mean":6.3016585108842,"rank":5074421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1775831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7103144,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320470,"mean":9.3716059025987,"rank":202832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":99206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320470,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7780,"mean":2.7269751896131,"rank":5906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":1690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7780,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316,"mean":1.9630920634921,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
