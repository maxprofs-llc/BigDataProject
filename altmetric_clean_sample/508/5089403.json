Self-regulation tools are not always used optimally, and implementation intention plans often lack quality. Therefore, this study explored participants' use and evaluation of self-regulation techniques and their impact on goal attainment. Methods. Data were obtained from 452 adults in a proof of concept (POC) intervention of 'MyPlan', an eHealth intervention using self-regulation techniques to promote three healthy behaviours (physical activity (PA), fruit intake, or vegetable intake). Participants applied self-regulation techniques to a self-selected health behaviour, and evaluated the self-regulation techniques. The quality of implementation intentions was rated by the authors as a function of instrumentality (instrumental and non-instrumental) and specificity (non-specific and medium to highly specific). Logistic regression analyses were conducted to predict goal attainment. Results. Goal attainment was significantly predicted by the motivational value of the personal advice (OR:1.86), by the specificity of the implementation intentions (OR:3.5), by the motivational value of the action plan (OR:1.86), and by making a new action plan at follow-up (OR:4.10). Interaction-effects with behaviour showed that the specificity score of the implementation intention plans (OR:4.59), the motivational value of the personal advice (OR:2.38), selecting hindering factors and solutions(OR:2.00) and making a new action plan at follow-up (OR:7.54) were predictive of goal attainment only for fruit or vegetable intake. Also, when participants in the fruit and vegetable group made more than three plans, they were more likely to attain their goal (OR:1.73), whereas the reverse was the case in the PA group (OR:0.34). Discussion. The chance that adults reach fruit and vegetable goals can be increased by including motivating personal advice, self-formulated action plans, and instructions\/strategies to make specific implementation intentions into eHealth interventions. To increase the chance that adults reach short-term PA goals, it is suggested to keep eHealth PA interventions simple and focus only on developing a few implementation intentions. However, more research is needed to identify behaviour change techniques that can increase health goal attainment at long-term.","altmetric_jid":"521f51273cf0582f62000000","authors":["Jolien Plaete","Ilse De Bourdeaudhuij","Maite Verloigne","Geert Crombez","Plaete, Jolien","De Bourdeaudhuij, Ilse","Verloigne, Maite","Crombez, Geert"],"doi":"10.7717\/peerj.1666","first_seen_on":"2016-02-04T10:20:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"1854\/LU-7185306","handles":["1854\/LU-7185306"],"issns":["2167-8359"],"journal":"PeerJ","last_mentioned_on":1459318219,"links":["https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/1666\/","https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/1666?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.7717\/peerj.1666"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/1666.pdf","pmid":"26966648","pubdate":"2016-02-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"PeerJ Inc.","startpage":"e1666","title":"The use and evaluation of self-regulation techniques can predict health goal attainment in adults: an explorative study","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-selfregulation-techniques-predict-health-goal-attainment-adults-explorative-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7465518,"mean":6.4808427461848,"rank":1643083,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5810538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7465518,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":323294,"mean":9.4938142613663,"rank":87063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":235322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":323294,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3086,"mean":21.229657050243,"rank":1639,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3086,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312,"mean":19.135948553055,"rank":144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
