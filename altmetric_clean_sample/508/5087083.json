Diagnosis and treatment strategies for symptomatic adult AP remain controversial. We describe two different presentation of AP: a woman with a specific upper abdominal pain treated with medical therapy and a man with upper gastroenteric obstructive symptoms which underwent surgical duodeno-jejunal by-pass. English language literature about annular pancreas etiology, diagnosis and treatment was reviewed. No specific guidelines and protocols exist about management of AP, therefore, treatment and operative approaches must be individualized. In consideration of the possible post-operative complications, surgical treatment should be reserved in case of failure of conservative medical therapies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079f2","authors":["Rondelli, Fabio","Bugiantella, Walter","Stella, Paolo","Boni, Marcello","Mariani, Enrico","Crusco, Federico","Sanguinetti, Alessandro","Polistena, Andrea","Avenia, Nicola"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijscr.2016.02.001","first_seen_on":"2016-02-03T22:09:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["22102612","2210-2612"],"journal":"International Journal of Surgery Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1454537372,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S2210261216000468&_version=1&md5=6b816814ce7a1d76b141c2fb7fd34157"],"pmid":"26867720","pubdate":"2016-02-13T22:01:57+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"SYMPTOMATIC ANNULAR PANCREAS IN ADULT: REPORT OF TWO DIFFERENT PRESENTATIONS AND TREATMENTS AND REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/symptomatic-annular-pancreas-adult-report-two-different-presentations-treatments-review-literature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7089314,"mean":6.2945947100909,"rank":5314932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":991602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7089314,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319703,"mean":9.3795138973166,"rank":220777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":55601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319703,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":699,"mean":1.8737936962751,"rank":241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":699,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":0.99274336283186,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
