In the initial stage, reaction of W(\u2550NC6H3-2,6-(i)Pr2)Cl4 with MBTCD afforded a tetranuclear W(V) imido cluster, [W(\u2550NC6H3-2,6-(i)Pr2)Cl3]4 (2), which served as a unique precursor for introducing redox-active ligands to the tungsten center to give the corresponding mononuclear complexes with a general formula of W(\u2550NC6H3-2,6-(i)Pr2)Cl3(L) (3, L = L1; 4, L = L2; and 6, L = L3). X-ray analyses of complexes 3 and 6 revealed a neutral coordination mode of L1 and L3 to the tungsten in solid state, while the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of 3 and 4 clarified that a radical was predominantly located on the tungsten center supported by neutral L1 or L2, and the EPR spectra of complex 6 indicated that a radical was delocalized over both the tungsten center and the monoanionic redox-active ligand L3.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Hiromasa Tanahashi"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.5b02145","first_seen_on":"2016-02-04T00:57:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1454547425,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.5b02145"],"pmid":"26841126","pubdate":"2016-02-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis and Characterization of Paramagnetic Tungsten Imido Complexes Bearing \u03b1-Diimine Ligands","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-characterization-paramagnetic-tungsten-imido-complexes-bearing-%CE%B1diimine-ligands"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7099316,"mean":6.2990871854507,"rank":6107187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7099316,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318982,"mean":9.383319000191,"rank":263556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318982,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372,"mean":1.0711687970374,"rank":4666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":354,"mean":1.1247875354108,"rank":211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":354,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
