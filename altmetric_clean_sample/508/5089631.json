We aimed to evaluate the impact of an involved margin and its location (anterior vs. posterior) on disease recurrence.\nOf the 638 eligible patients, 538 (85.9%) did not have an involved margin (group I) while 100 (14.1%) did (group II). The latter group was further classified according to its location relative to the surface of the thyroid gland (anterior or posterior). A multivariate analysis was conducted to identify independent factors for recurrence risk.\nAfter a mean of 130.1\u2009\u00b1\u200993.5 months, 22 patients had disease recurrence. The 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly worse in group II (95.0% vs. 97.0%, P\u2009=\u20090.011). After adjusting other significant factors, involved margin was not an independent risk factor for disease recurrence (P\u2009=\u20090.358). Compared to a negative margin, an anterior involved margin did not pose increased recurrence risk (HR\u2009=\u20091.21, 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.93-500.00, P\u2009=\u20090.368), whereas a posterior involved margin had almost 23 times higher recurrence risk (HR\u2009=\u200922.95; 95%CI\u2009=\u20094.33-121.70, P\u2009<\u20090.001).\nOverall, a microscopically involved margin was not an independent factor for DFS. However, although an anterior involved margin itself did not increase disease recurrence, a posterior involved margin did. J. Surg.
