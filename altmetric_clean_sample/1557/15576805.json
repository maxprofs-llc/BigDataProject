The impact of coronary slow flow phenomenon (CSFP) on biventricular functions has not been comprehensively evaluated using this new technology. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of CSFP on biventricular systolic functions using 3D-STE. Forty patients with CSFP and otherwise normal coronary arteries (NCAs) and 40 age- and sex-matched controls with normal coronary angiograms (CAGs) were prospectively enrolled. Biventricular systolic function was evaluated by 3D-STE. Left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal, circumferential and radial strains, ejection fraction (EF) were significantly lower and LV end-systolic volume (ESV) was significantly higher in the CSFP group compared to the control group. There were no significant differences in LV mass, LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) or LV stroke volume (SV). Additionally, Right ventricular (RV) free wall, septal wall and global longitudinal strains, and RV EF were significantly lower in the CSFP group, but there were no significant differences in RV EDV, ESV and RV SV. The present study demonstrated that CSFP has a notable negative effect on not only 3D strain parameters but also biventricular EF. There was a strong correlation between the strain parameters of the affected vessel's myocardial area and the TIMI frame count of same vessel.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f610007843","authors":["Tu\u011fba Kemalo\u011flu \u00d6z","Mehmet Eren","I\u015f\u0131l Atasoy","Tayfun G\u00fcrol","\u00d6zer Soylu","Bahad\u0131r Da\u011fdeviren"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10554-016-1054-2","first_seen_on":"2017-01-19T02:10:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1569-5794","1573-0743"],"journal":"The International Journal of Cardiovascular Imaging (formerly Cardiac Imaging)","last_mentioned_on":1485003506,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10554-016-1054-2"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10554-016-1054-2.pdf","pmid":"28063138","pubdate":"2017-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiac Imaging","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Are biventricular systolic functions impaired in patient with coronoray slow flow?
