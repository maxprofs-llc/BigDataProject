Based on children's timetables, break times and PE periods were determined and PA was calculated individually and subsequently classified in light (1.5-3 MET), moderate (3-6 MET) and vigorous (>6 MET) intensities. Weight status was determined during a school visit.\nChildren spent 133\u2009\u00b1\u200961\u00a0min in MVPA; on weekdays, this amount increased significantly (141\u2009\u00b1\u200966\u00a0min, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01). 45.9\u00a0% of children reached physical activity guidelines of 60\u00a0min of MVPA daily, with boys achieving this goal significantly more often than girls (65.6 vs. 28.7\u00a0%, respectively; p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01). PE lessons and break times accounted for 15\u2009\u00b1\u200913\u00a0min (12.7\u00a0%) and 7\u2009\u00b1\u20096\u00a0min (5.8\u00a0%) of daily MVPA, respectively. On days with PE, children spent 144\u2009\u00b1\u200968\u00a0min in MVPA, whereas on days without PE, this time decreased significantly to 122\u2009\u00b1\u200963\u00a0min (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01).\nThe findings suggest that segments such as PE lessons and morning breaks are important sources for MVPA for boys and girls. This should therefore be considered for policies, timetables and curriculums in order to offer sufficient opportunities for children to be physically active during the school day.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a98","authors":["Susanne Kobel","Sarah Kettner","Christine L\u00e4mmle","J\u00fcrgen M.
