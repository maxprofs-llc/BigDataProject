We assessed safety and effectiveness of Juv\u00e9derm Ultra Plus in a Chinese population.\nThis double-blind study randomized Chinese subjects with severe NLFs to Juv\u00e9derm Ultra Plus (24\u2009mg\/mL) in 1 NLF and Restylane injectable gel (20\u2009mg\/mL) in the other NLF. NLFs were evaluated using the validated 5-point photonumeric Allergan NLF Severity Scale (0 is \"no wrinkle\" and 4 is \"very deep wrinkle\"). Investigator-assessed responder rates (primary outcome at 6 months), NLF mean improvements, and subject-assessed responder rates and preference were assessed.\nOf 124 subjects randomized, 122 completed the 6-month visit. NLFs treated with Juv\u00e9derm Ultra Plus required less volume than those treated with Restylane (median [range]: 0.80 [0.3-2.0] vs 1.00 [0.3-1.9]; P<0.001). Investigator-assessed responder rates were 90.4% for Juv\u00e9derm Ultra Plus and 89.6% for Restylane, establishing noninferiority of Juv\u00e9derm Ultra Plus. Mean (SD) improvements in NLF Severity Scale scores from baseline at 6 months were 1.5 (0.75) for Juv\u00e9derm Ultra Plus and 1.6 (0.73) for Restylane. Subject-assessed responder rates were similar to investigator-assessed rates (87.3%, Juv\u00e9derm Ultra Plus; 83.9%, Restylane). Of subjects reporting a preference, 62.1% preferred Juv\u00e9derm Ultra Plus. The most common treatment site responses were swelling and tenderness; most were mild or moderate in severity and resolved without intervention. Juv\u00e9derm Ultra Plus had fewer severe treatment site responses than Restylane.\nIn this study in Chinese subjects, Juv\u00e9derm Ultra Plus was safe and effective for correcting severe NLFs.","altmetric_jid":"5523eeb32a83ee005f8b4574","authors":["Li, Dong","Xie, Yun","Li, Qin","Sun, Jiaming","Jiang, Ping","Jia, Yi","Murphy, Diane K.","Li, Qingfeng"],"doi":"10.1097\/gox.0000000000001133","first_seen_on":"2017-01-19T07:48:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2169-7574"],"issue":"1","journal":"PRS Global Open","last_mentioned_on":1487738817,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/prsgo\/Abstract\/latest\/Safety_and_Effectiveness_of_Juvederm_Ultra_Plus.98947.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/prsgo\/Fulltext\/2017\/01000\/Safety_and_Effectiveness_of_Juv_derm_Ultra_Plus.3.aspx?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/prsgo\/9000\/00000\/Safety_and_Effectiveness_of_Juvederm_Ultra_Plus.98947.pdf","pmid":"28203492","pubdate":"2017-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","startpage":"1","title":"Safety and Effectiveness of Juv\u00e9derm Ultra Plus Injectable Gel in Correcting Severe Nasolabial Folds in Chinese Subjects","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/prsgo\/Fulltext\/latest\/Safety_and_Effectiveness_of_Juvederm_Ultra_Plus.98947.aspx","volume":"Latest Articles","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-effectiveness-juv%C3%A9derm-ultra-plus-injectable-gel-correcting-severe-nasolabial-folds-chinese-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":3.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":1931202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6310663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271478,"mean":12.591881691635,"rank":86078,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":184615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271478,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":863,"mean":7.1187540603248,"rank":354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":863,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":8.9752293577982,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
