Yet, there is disagreement on aetiology, pathomechanics and terminology. A plethora of terms have been employed to explain inguinal-related groin pain in athletes. Recently, at the British Hernia Society in Manchester 2012, a consensus was reached to use the term inguinal disruption based on the pathophysiology while lately the Doha agreement in 2014 defined it as inguinal-related groin pain, a clinically based taxonomy. This review article emphasizes the anatomy, pathogenesis, standard clinical assessment and imaging, and highlights the treatment options for inguinal disruption.","altmetric_jid":"554b869a2a83ee864e8b45d9","authors":["Dimitrakopoulou, A","Alexandra Dimitrakopoulou","Ernest Schilders"],"doi":"10.1093\/jhps\/hnv083","endpage":"22","first_seen_on":"2016-04-28T15:42:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2054-8397"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Hip Preservation Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1483383653,"links":["http:\/\/eprints.leedsbeckett.ac.uk\/2615\/","http:\/\/jhps.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/02\/24\/jhps.hnv083.full","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4808262\/?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=postplanner&utm_source=twitter.com","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4808262\/?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=postplanner&utm_source=facebook.com"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jhps.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/02\/24\/jhps.hnv083.full.pdf","pmid":"27026822","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","startpage":"16","title":"Sportsman\u2019s hernia?
