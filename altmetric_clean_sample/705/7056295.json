This induces vascular smooth muscle cell activation and subsequent re-endothelialization with expression of \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin by endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cell. Thus, poly-N-butylcyanoacrylate microbubbles (MBs) targeted to \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin were evaluated for monitoring vascular healing after vessel injury in pigs using molecular ultrasound imaging.\nApproval for animal experiments was obtained. The binding specificity of \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin-targeted MB to human umbilical vein endothelial cells was tested with fluorescence microscopy. In vivo imaging was performed using a clinical ultrasound system and an 8-MHz probe. Six mini pigs were examined after vessel injury in the left carotid artery. The right carotid served as control. Uncoated MB, cDRG-coated MB, and \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin-specific cRGD-coated MB were injected sequentially. Bound MBs were assessed 8 minutes after injection using ultrasound replenishment analysis. Measurements were performed 2 hours, 1 and 5 weeks, and 3 and 6 months after injury. In vivo data were validated by immunohistochemistry.\nSignificantly stronger binding of cRGD-MB than MB and cDRG-MB to human umbilical vein endothelial cells was found (P < 0.01). As vessel injury leads to upregulation of \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin, cRGD-MBs bound significantly stronger (P < 0.05) in injured carotid arteries than at the counter side 1 week after vessel injury and significant differences could also be observed after 5 weeks. After 3 months, \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin expression decreased to baseline and binding of cRGD-MB was comparable in both vessels. Values remained at baseline also after 6 months.\nUltrasound imaging with RGD-MB is promising for monitoring vascular healing after vessel injury. This may open new perspectives to assess vascular damage after radiological interventions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a7a","authors":["Rix, Anne","Fokong, Stanley","Heringer, Sarah","Pjontek, Rastislav","Kabelitz, Lisa","Theek, Benjamin","Brockmann, Marc-Alexander","Wiesmann, Martin","Kiessling, Fabian"],"doi":"10.1097\/rli.0000000000000282","first_seen_on":"2016-04-28T14:06:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0020-9996","1536-0210"],"journal":"Investigative Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1461851158,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/investigativeradiology\/9000\/00000\/Molecular_Ultrasound_Imaging_of.99200.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/investigativeradiology\/9000\/00000\/Molecular_Ultrasound_Imaging_of.99200.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/investigativeradiology\/9000\/00000\/Molecular_Ultrasound_Imaging_of.99200.pdf","pmid":"27119438","pubdate":"2016-04-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Molecular Ultrasound Imaging of \u03b1v\u03b23-Integrin Expression in Carotid Arteries of Pigs After Vessel Injury","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/investigativeradiology\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Molecular_Ultrasound_Imaging_of.99200.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-ultrasound-imaging-alphavbeta3integrin-expression-carotid-arteries-pigs-after-vessel-injur"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7621460,"mean":6.5607387299425,"rank":5495393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1854860,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7621460,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266739,"mean":11.402780803635,"rank":171571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":79802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266739,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":957,"mean":1.2035188284519,"rank":300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":957,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.0357142857143,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
