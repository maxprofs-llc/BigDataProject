Branched plasticized PLA was successfully obtained by coupling poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA) to crotonic acid (CA) functionalized PLA. The plasticization behavior of PBSA coupled PLA (PLA-CA-PBSA) and its counterpart PBSA blended PLA (PLA\/PBSA) were fully elucidated. For both PLA-CA-PBSA and PLA\/PBSA, a decrease of Tg to around room temperature and an increase in the elongation at break of PLA from 14% to 165% and 460%, respectively, were determined. The crystallinity was increased from 2.1% to 8.4% for PLA\/PBSA and even more, to 10.6%, for PLA-CA-PBSA. Due to the inherent poor miscibility between the PBSA and PLA, phase separation occurred in the blend, while PLA-CA-PBSA showed no phase separation which, together with the higher crystallinity, led to better oxygen barrier properties compared to neat PLA and PLA\/PBSA. A higher resistance to migration during hydrolytic degradation for the PLA-CA-PBSA compared to the PLA\/PBSA indicated that the plasticization effect of PBSA in the coupled material would be retained for a longer time period.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041bc","authors":["Xi Yang"],"doi":"10.3390\/ma9050313","first_seen_on":"2016-04-28T09:32:48+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["1996-1944"],"issue":"5","journal":"Materials (1996-1944)","last_mentioned_on":1466001994,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/9\/5\/313"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/9\/5\/313\/pdf","pmid":"28773437","pubdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"313","title":"Poly(lactide)-g-poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) with High Crystallization Capacity and Migration Resistance","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polylactidegpolybutylene-succinatecoadipate-high-crystallization-capacity-migration-resistance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7902020,"mean":6.6891515940364,"rank":3564687,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4258684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7902020,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268771,"mean":11.431004115042,"rank":116231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":148002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268771,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":999,"mean":0.91225851703407,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":999,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":0.76265060240964,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
