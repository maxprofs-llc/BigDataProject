Digital photographs of patients with cataract were taken using a smartphone camera (an iPhone 5) on a telescopic mount and a Canon EOS 10D anterior segment camera. Images were graded and compared according to the Lens Opacification Classification System III (LOCS III).\nA total of 440 anterior segment images were graded independently by 2 ophthalmologists, 2 residents and 2 medical students. Intraclass correlation (ICC) between the iPhone and anterior segment camera images were fair for nuclear opalescence (NO) and nuclear colour (NC), and excellent for cortical (C) and posterior subcapsular (PSC) (NO: ICC 0.40, 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.57; NC: ICC 0.47, 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.66; C: ICC 0.76, 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.81; PSC: ICC 0.81, 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.85). There was no difference in grader impression of confidence and images usability between both cameras (P = 0.66 and P = 0.58, respectively).\nAnterior segment images taken from an iPhone have good reproducibility for retro-illuminated images, but fair reproducibility for NO and NC under low light settings. There were no differences in grader confidence and subjective image suitability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd2e","authors":["Chen, David Zy","Tan, Clement Wt"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-28T11:36:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0304-4602"],"issue":"1","journal":"Annals of the Academy of Medicine Singapore","last_mentioned_on":1461840635,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27118223?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27118223","pubdate":"2016-04-28T22:01:49+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Smartphone Imaging in Ophthalmology: A Comparison with Traditional Methods on the Reproducibility and Usability for Anterior Segment Imaging.","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/smartphone-imaging-ophthalmology-comparison-traditional-methods-reproducibility-usability-anterior-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7621460,"mean":6.5607387299425,"rank":6597481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7621460,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266738,"mean":11.402863667207,"rank":223535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266738,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174,"mean":1.9992601156069,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.53333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
