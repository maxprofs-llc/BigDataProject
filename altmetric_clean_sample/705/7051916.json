Multiplex PCR and sequencing methods were used to detect gelE, esp and asa1 genes in enterococci with intermediate or full resistance to vancomycin.\nThe rate of carriage of the genes was gelE (91%), esp (79%) and asa1 (87%).\nThe majority of enterococcal strains with resistance to vancomycin carry genes for all three potential virulence factors that were analyzed in this study. This might explain why enterococcal infections appear to be more virulent than in the past.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026ff","authors":["Nateghian, Alireza","Fallah, Fatemeh","Daghighi, Zahra","Goudarzi, Hossein","Hashemi, Ali","Robinson, Joan L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.diagmicrobio.2016.03.020","first_seen_on":"2016-04-28T09:34:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0070","07328893"],"journal":"Diagnostic Microbiology & Infectious Disease","last_mentioned_on":1461835686,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27112833?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27112833","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"Detection of virulence genes in resistant enterococci isolated from pediatric patients at high risk for nosocomial infections","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detection-virulence-genes-resistant-enterococci-isolated-pediatric-patients-high-risk-nosocomial-inf"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7621460,"mean":6.5607387299425,"rank":6597471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7621460,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266739,"mean":11.402836101343,"rank":223531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266739,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":701,"mean":1.9761857142857,"rank":577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":701,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.1685185185185,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/par_papers\/statuses\/725617576043139072","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7051916],"posted_on":"2016-04-28T09:28:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Parasitology papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/528615611803238400\/tFsCRNLw_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Parasitology papers in PubMed, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
