Therapeutic management remains challenging and the development of effective treatment modalities is hampered by insufficient understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. However, recent findings indicate that in addition to AMR-triggered activation of the classical complement pathway, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by innate immune cell subsets also promotes vascular graft injury. This review summarizes the accumulating evidence for the contribution of natural killer cells, the key mediators of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, to human AMR in allotransplantation and xenotransplantation and illustrates the current mechanistic conceptions drawn from animal models.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008bed","authors":["Resch, Thomas","Fabritius, Cornelia","Ebner, Susanne","Ritschl, Paul","Kotsch, Katja"],"doi":"10.1097\/tp.0000000000000757","endpage":"1340","first_seen_on":"2016-04-28T14:33:14+00:00","issns":["1534-6080","0041-1337"],"issue":"7","journal":"Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1461853510,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26018352?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26018352","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1335","title":"The Role of Natural Killer Cells in Humoral Rejection","type":"article","volume":"99","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-natural-killer-cells-humoral-rejection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7621460,"mean":6.5607387299425,"rank":6597491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7621460,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266740,"mean":11.402731306633,"rank":223543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266740,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2832,"mean":2.3898361003179,"rank":2692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2832,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":5.3363142857143,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
