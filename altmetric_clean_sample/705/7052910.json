Cox regression models for progression-free and overall survival were constructed with a comprehensive set of clinical variables. Analysis was intentionn-ton-treat, quantifying the effect of treatment intent decided at the multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT).\nOne thousand one hundred and nine patients presented with synchronous metastatic disease between July 2009 and November 2015. Median follow-up was 15.8\u2009months; 4.4% (group 1) had already curative resections of primary and metastases prior to MDT, 22.2% (group 2) were considered curative but were referred to MDT for opinion and\/or medical oncology treatment prior to resection and 70.2% were considered palliative at MDT (group 3). Overall, 83% received chemotherapy, 55% had their primary resected and 23% had their metastases resected; 13% of resections were synchronous, 20% were staged with primary resected first and 62% had only the colorectal primary managed surgically. Performance status, metastasis resection (R0 versus R1 versus R2 versus no resection), resection of the colorectal primary and treatment intent determined at MDT were the most significant factors for progression-free and overall survival.\nThis is the largest Australian series of synchronous metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma and offers insight into the nature and utility of contemporary practice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002360","authors":["Malouf, Phillip","Gibbs, Peter","Shapiro, Jeremy","Sockler, Jim","Bell, Stephen","Phillip Malouf","Peter Gibbs","Jeremy Shapiro","Jim Sockler","Stephen Bell"],"doi":"10.1111\/ans.13619","first_seen_on":"2016-04-28T10:47:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1445-2197","14451433"],"journal":"Australian & New Zealand Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1461838775,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/ans.13619&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ans.13619\/pdf","pmid":"27122066","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Australian contemporary management of synchronous metastatic colorectal cancer","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/ans.13619","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/australian-contemporary-management-synchronous-metastatic-colorectal-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7621460,"mean":6.5607387299425,"rank":6597475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7621460,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266738,"mean":11.402872102483,"rank":223535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266738,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1464,"mean":1.8134162679426,"rank":1220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1464,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":0.86681818181818,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SurgeryScience\/statuses\/725630532927639552","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7052910],"posted_on":"2016-04-28T10:19:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Surgical Research","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/552556384688939009\/rWmyj-8R_normal.jpeg","description":"Latest surgical research journal papers as they're published | Academic updates and CME | @DrEdFitzgerald","id_on_source":"SurgeryScience","tweeter_id":"2707749445","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2180},"tweet_id":"725630532927639552"}]}}
