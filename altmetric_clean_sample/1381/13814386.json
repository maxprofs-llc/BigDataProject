Nationally, an estimated 10.2 million e-cigarette users (68.2%), 6.1 million hookah users (82.3%), 4.1 million cigar smokers (36.2%) and 4.0 million smokeless tobacco users (50.6%) used flavoured products in the past 30\u2005days. The most prevalent flavours reported were menthol\/mint (76.9%) for smokeless tobacco; fruit (74.0%) for hookah; fruit (52.4%), candy\/chocolate\/other sweet flavours (22.0%) and alcohol (14.5%) for cigars\/cigarillos\/filtered little cigars; fruit (44.9%), menthol\/mint (43.9%) and candy\/chocolate\/other sweet flavours (25.7%) for e-cigarettes and fruit (56.6%), candy\/chocolate\/other sweet flavours (26.5%) and menthol\/mint (24.8%) for pipes. Except for hookah and pipes, past 30-day flavoured product use was highest among 18-24-year olds. By cigarette smoking, never smoking e-cigarette users (84.8%) were more likely to report flavoured e-cigarette use, followed by recent former smokers (78.1%), long-term former smokers (70.4%) and current smokers (63.2%).\nFlavoured NCTP use is prominent among US adult tobacco users, particularly among e-cigarette, hookah and cigar users. Flavoured product use, especially fruit and sweet-flavoured products, was higher among younger adults. It is important for tobacco prevention and control strategies to address all forms of tobacco use, including flavoured tobacco products.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003670","authors":["Mich\u00e8le G Bonhomme","Enver Holder-Hayes","Bridget K Ambrose","Cindy Tworek","Shari P Feirman","Brian A King","Benjamin J Apelberg","Bonhomme, Mich\u00e8le G","Holder-Hayes, Enver","Ambrose, Bridget K","Tworek, Cindy","Feirman, Shari P","King, Brian A","Apelberg, Benjamin J"],"doi":"10.1136\/tobaccocontrol-2016-053373","endpage":"ii13","first_seen_on":"2016-11-19T09:19:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1468-3318","0964-4563"],"issue":"Suppl 2","journal":"Tobacco Control","last_mentioned_on":1479547142,"links":["http:\/\/tobaccocontrolbeta.bmj.com\/content\/25\/Suppl_2\/ii4?ijkey=8ff9f06769ee9d060b0a407e58df931ea9b16e9b&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha","http:\/\/tobaccocontrol.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/10\/28\/tobaccocontrol-2016-053373.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/tobaccocontrolbeta.bmj.com\/content\/tobaccocontrol\/25\/Suppl_2\/ii4.full.pdf","pmid":"27794065","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"ii4","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Flavoured non-cigarette tobacco product use among US adults: 2013\u20132014","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/tobaccocontrol.bmj.com\/lookup\/doi\/10.1136\/tobaccocontrol-2016-053373","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/flavoured-noncigarette-tobacco-product-among-adults-20132014"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7715105,"mean":6.6184650148513,"rank":5833638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1041459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7715105,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247963,"mean":12.141906058186,"rank":170601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":47669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247963,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1797,"mean":18.881344097996,"rank":1719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1797,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":57.881,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
