With a view of separating Nd(3+) and Dy(3+) in an aqueous solution, we demonstrate that crystallization of the CPs of Nd(3+) and Dy(3+) based on dibutyl phosphoric acid (Hdbp) can be thermodynamically described; crystallization yields of [Ln(dbp)3] (Ln = Nd or Dy) complex are predicted well using a simple calculation, which takes the apparent solubility products (Ksp(a)) for [Ln(dbp)3] and the acid dissociation constant of Hdbp into account. The Ksp(a) values of [Nd(dbp)3] and [Dy(dbp)3] are experimentally determined to be (1.3 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10(-14) and (2.9 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10(-18) M(4), respectively, at 20 \u00b0C. The ratio of these Ksp(a) values, that is, ca. 4500, is significantly larger than the ratio of the solubility products for inorganic salts of Nd(3+) and Dy(3+). Therefore, Nd(3+) and Dy(3+) are selectively crystallized in an aqueous solution via the formation of CPs. Under optimized conditions, Dy(3+) crystallization is preferable, whereas Nd(3+) remains in the solution phase, where the ratio of the Dy molar content to the total metal content (i.e., Nd + Dy) in the crystal is higher than 0.9. The use of acids, such as HCl or HNO3, has no practical impact on the separation in an aqueous solution.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec5","authors":["Yuiko Tasaki-Handa"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpcb.6b09450","first_seen_on":"2016-12-03T12:40:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-6106","1520-5207"],"issue":"49","journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry B","last_mentioned_on":1481087000,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jpcb.6b09450"],"pmid":"27973821","pubdate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Selective Crystallization of Phosphoester Coordination Polymer for the Separation of Neodymium and Dysprosium: A Thermodynamic Approach","type":"article","volume":"120","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selective-crystallization-phosphoester-coordination-polymer-separation-neodymium-dysprosium-thermody"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360922,"mean":7.0503075151572,"rank":6344538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1133446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360922,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279266,"mean":11.967503038332,"rank":193457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":53339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279266,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4083,"mean":1.7480166585007,"rank":1830,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4083,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254,"mean":0.9875256916996,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MOF_papers\/statuses\/805028950397157376","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14417011],"posted_on":"2016-12-03T12:40:33+00:00","author":{"name":"MOF Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/459335281527631872\/i9g-dpzU_normal.png","description":"I'm a bot that surveys the metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOF) literature for you!
