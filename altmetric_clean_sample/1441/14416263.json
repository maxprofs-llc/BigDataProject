However, there is a paucity of recent research reviewing the students' perspectives of facilitators' qualities that influence their learning. This paper explores undergraduate nursing students' perceptions of the qualities of a clinical facilitator that enhanced their learning. The study was designed as a cross-sectional survey. A total of 452 third year nursing students at one Australian University were invited to participate. A total of 43 students completed the survey and were analysed; thus, the response rate was 9.7%. Results of the study indicate that nursing students perceive availability, approachability and feedback from the clinical facilitator to be highly influential to their learning in the clinical setting. The relational interdependence of these is discussed. Clinical facilitators have an important role in student learning. The findings of this study can be used in the development of clinical facilitator models, guidelines and in continuing education.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005696","authors":["Linda Sweet","Julie Broadbent"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nepr.2016.11.007","endpage":"36","first_seen_on":"2016-12-03T11:48:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["14715953","1873-5223"],"journal":"Nurse Education in Practice","last_mentioned_on":1490342552,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/authShare\/S1471595316302335\/20161202T183000Z\/1?md5=2bdda92bc1c6c6e6314ce5314b88098d","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nurseeducationinpractice.com%2Farticle%2FS1471-5953%2816%2930233-5%2Ffulltext&rc=0&code=ynepr-site","http:\/\/www.nurseeducationinpractice.com\/article\/S1471-5953(16)30233-5\/fulltext","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=1&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nurseeducationinpractice.com%2Farticle%2FS1471-5953%2816%2930233-5%2Ffulltext&code=ynepr-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=3&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nurseeducationinpractice.com%2Farticle%2FS1471-5953%2816%2930233-5%2Ffulltext&code=ynepr-site","http:\/\/www.nurseeducationinpractice.com\/article\/S1471-5953(16)30233-5\/fulltext?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nurseeducationinpractice.com\/article\/S1471595316302335\/pdf","pmid":"27918904","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"30","subjects":["nursing","education"],"title":"Nursing students' perceptions of the qualities of a clinical facilitator that enhance learning","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1471595316302335","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nursing-students-perceptions-qualities-clinical-facilitator-enhance-learning"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.05,"score_history":{"1y":9.05,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":974871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7432876,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281733,"mean":11.953096865105,"rank":48102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":233523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281733,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":330,"mean":2.8345896656535,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":330,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":4.35625,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":3,"practitioner":5,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
