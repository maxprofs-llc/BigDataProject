Labeling of PSMA tracers with (18)F offers numerous advantages, including improved image resolution, longer half-life and increased production yields. The aim of this study was to assess the PSA-stratified performance of the (18)F-labeled PSMA tracer (18)F-DCFPyL and the (68)Ga-labeled reference (68)Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC.\nWe examined 191 consecutive patients with biochemical recurrence according to standard acquisition protocols with (18)F-DCFPyL (N = 62, 269.8 MBq, PET scan at 120 minutes p.i.) or (68)Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC (N = 129, 158.9 MBq, 60 minutes p.i.). We determined PSA-stratified sensitivity rates for both tracers and corrected our calculations for Gleason scores using iterative matched-pair analyses. As an orthogonal validation, we directly compared tracer distribution patterns in a separate cohort of 25 patients, sequentially examined with both tracers.\nAfter prostatectomy (N = 106), the sensitivity of both tracers was significantly associated with absolute PSA levels (P = 4.3x10-3). Sensitivity increased abruptly, when PSA values exceeded 0.5\u00b5g\/L (P = 2.4x10-5). For PSA <3.5\u00b5g\/L, most relapses were diagnosed at a still limited stage (P = 3.4x10-6). For PSA of 0.5-3.5\u00b5g\/L, PSA-stratified sensitivity was 88% (15\/17) for (18)F-DCFPyL and 66% (23\/35) for (68)Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC. This significant difference was preserved in the Gleason-matched-pair analysis. Outside of this range, sensitivity was comparably low (PSA <0.5\u00b5g\/L) or high (PSA >3.5\u00b5g\/L). After radiotherapy (N = 85), tracer sensitivity was largely PSA-independent. In the 25 patients examined with both tracers, distribution patterns of (18)F-DCFPyL and (68)Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC were strongly comparable (P = 2.71x10-8). However, in 36% of the PSMA-positive patients we detected additional lesions on the (18)F-DCFPyL scan (P = 3.7x10-2).\nOur data suggest that (18)F-DCFPyL is non-inferior to (68)Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC, while offering the advantages of (18)F-labeling. Our results indicate that imaging with (18)F-DCFPyL may even exhibit improved sensitivity in localizing relapsed tumors after prostatectomy for moderately increased PSA levels. Although the standard acquisition protocols, used for (18)F-DCFPyL and (68)Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC in this study, stipulate different activity doses and tracer uptake times after injection, our findings provide a promising rationale for validation of (18)F-DCFPyL in future prospective trials.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da6","authors":["Dietlein, Felix","Kobe, Carsten","Neubauer, Stephan","Schmidt, Matthias","Stockter, Simone","Fischer, Thomas","Schom\u00e4cker, Klaus","Heidenreich, Axel","Zlatopolskiy, Boris D","Neumaier, Bernd","Drzezga, Alexander","Dietlein, Markus","Felix Dietlein","Carsten Kobe","Stephan Neubauer","Matthias Schmidt","Simone Stockter","Thomas Fischer","Klaus Schom\u00e4cker","Axel Heidenreich","Boris D.
