Telephone interviews of all survivors were conducted to determine obstetrical and contraceptive history. A subgroup underwent further telephone interview to address subsequent reproductive decisions.\nBy November 2015, 116 medical records of patients diagnosed with AFE were reviewed. Patients who had undergone hysterectomy (n=26), died (n=9), or developed Sheehan's syndrome (n=1) at the time of the original event were excluded from the present analysis. Of the remaining 80 women, 30% (24\/80) had subsequently conceived and 32.5% (26\/80) patients or their partners had undergone permanent sterilization. At the time of this report, 66% (21\/32) of registry participants were categorized to have had AFE and 34% (11\/32) as not likely AFE or indeterminate.\nThe syndrome of AFE is over-diagnosed. Women diagnosed with AFE who survive conceive another pregnancy less frequently than US women over similar time intervals and often choose a permanent sterilization method, whether or not they actually had AFE, largely out of fear of AFE recurrence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002845","authors":["Amirhossein Moaddab","Miranda Klassen","Cynthia D.
