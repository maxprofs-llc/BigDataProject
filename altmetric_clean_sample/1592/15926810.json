The aim of the study is to investigate non-genetic and genetic factors associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and with cardiovascular risk factors. The protocol includes a detailed phenotyping of the participants, an oral glucose tolerance test, fasting laboratory measurements including proton nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, mass spectometry metabolomics, adipose tissue biopsies from 1,400 participants, and a stool sample. In our ongoing follow-up study, we have to date re-examined 6,496 participants. Extensive genotyping and exome sequencing have been performed for essentially all METSIM participants, and >2,000 METSIM participants have been whole genome sequenced. We have identified several non-genetic markers associated with the development of diabetes and cardiovascular events, and participated in several genetic association studies to identify gene variants associated with diabetes, hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk factors. The generation of a phenotype and genotype resource in the METSIM study allows us to proceed towards \"systems genetics\" approach which includes statistical methods to quantitate and integrate intermediate phenotypes, such as transcript, protein or metabolite levels to provide a global view of the molecular architecture of complex traits.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007d1d","authors":["Markku Laakso","Johanna Kuusisto","Alena Stancakova","Teemu Kuulasmaa","P\u00e4ivi Pajukanta","Aldons Jake Lusis","Francis S.
