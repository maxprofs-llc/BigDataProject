To qualitatively understand MICR, a three-layer model including charged layer, double layer and bulk layer is proposed, which could also be extended to understand the ICR at nanoscale. Based on this model, we propose when the charge in charged layer is comparable with that in the bulk layer, the ICR would occur no matter whether the electric double layer is overlapped. Moreover, the possible factors to influence the MICR including the length of PimB, the electrolyte concentration, and the radius of pipette are investigated and discussed. This study successfully extends the ICR to a micrometer scale, and thus would open a new area for the development of ICR-based sensors and devices by taking advantages of ease-in-manipulation and designable surface chemistry of micropipettes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Xiulan He","Kailin Zhang","Ting Li","Yanan Jiang","Ping Yu","Lanqun Mao"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.6b11696","first_seen_on":"2017-01-23T11:24:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1487300803,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.1021\/jacs.6b11696","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.6b11696?journalCode=jacsat&quickLinkVolume=139&quickLinkPage=1396&selectedTab=citation&volume=139"],"pmid":"28095691","pubdate":"2017-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Micrometer-Scale Ion Current Rectification at Polyelectrolyte Brush-Modified Micropipets","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.6b11696","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/micrometerscale-ion-current-rectification-polyelectrolyte-brushmodified-micropipets"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":9.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":897054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7314430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267420,"mean":12.764030364334,"rank":45028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":221815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267420,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19090,"mean":5.274604222327,"rank":2285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":16756,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19090,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":338,"mean":8.9603738872404,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":338,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
