We sought to determine any correlation between radiographic and pathologic response rates following NT.\nBetween 2005 and 2015, 38 patients at a tertiary care referral center underwent NT followed by pancreaticoduodenectomy for borderline resectable pancreas cancer. Radiographic response after the completion of NT and pathologic response after surgery were graded according to RECIST and Evans' criteria, respectively.\nPreoperatively, 50% of patients underwent chemotherapy alone and 50% underwent chemotherapy and chemoradiation. Radiographically, one patient demonstrated a complete radiologic response, 68.4% (n\u2009=\u200926) of patients had stable disease (SD), 26.3% (n\u2009=\u200910) demonstrated a partial response, and one patient had progressive. Among patients without radiographic response, 77.7% (n\u2009=\u200921) achieved a R0 resection. Of patients with SD on imaging, 26.9% (n\u2009=\u20097) had Evans grade IIB or greater pathologic response.\nOur data indicate that approximately one-fourth of patients who did not have a radiologic response had a grade IIB or greater pathologic response. In the absence of metastatic progression, lack of radiographic down-staging following NT should not preclude surgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e75","authors":["Xia, Brent T.","Fu, Baojin","Wang, Jiang","Kim, Young","Ahmad, S.
