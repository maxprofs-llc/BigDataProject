Besides well known risk factors like hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia, growing evidence suggests that also hormonal changes in various endocrine diseases impact cardiac morphology and function. Recent studies highlight the importance of ectopic intracellular myocardial and pericardial lipid deposition, since even slight changes of these fat depots are associated with alterations in cardiac performance. In this review we overview the effects of hormones, including insulin, thyroid hormones, growth hormone and cortisol, on heart function, focusing on their impact on myocardial lipid metabolism, cardiac substrate utilization and ectopic lipid deposition, in order to highlight the important role of even subtle hormonal changes for heart function in various endocrine and metabolic diseases.","altmetric_jid":"548ec0372a83ee48028b4567","authors":["Peter Wolf","Yvonne Winhofer","Martin Kr\u0161\u0161\u00e1k","Michael Krebs"],"doi":"10.1530\/ec-17-0031","first_seen_on":"2017-07-03T14:35:19+00:00","issns":["2049-3614"],"journal":"Endocrine Connections","last_mentioned_on":1499109987,"links":["http:\/\/www.endocrineconnections.com\/content\/6\/4\/R59"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.endocrineconnections.com\/content\/6\/4\/R59.full.pdf","pmid":"28420717","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"European Society of Endocrinology","title":"Heart, lipids and hormones","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/heart-lipids-hormones"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.2,"score_history":{"1y":4.2,"6m":4.2,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":1839166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6606702,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236263,"mean":12.966230354437,"rank":67381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":168228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236263,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196,"mean":4.2581128205128,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.26875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
