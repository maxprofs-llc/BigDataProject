A point of uncertainty in the erythromycin pathway has been whether the C-12 hydroxylase operates on each of two possible substrates, erythromycin B (ErB) and erythromycin D (ErD). Stassi et al. have cloned the gene, designated eryK, which encodes the P-450 monooxygenase responsible for erythromycin C-12 hydroxylation in Saccharopolyspora erythraea [Stassi, D., Donadio, S., Staver, M. J., & Katz, L. (1993) J. Bacteriol. 175, 182-189]. We report the overproduction of EryK in Escherichia coli as insoluble inclusion bodies; the solubilization, refolding, and reconstitution of active holo-EryK; and kinetic confirmation of a 1200-1900-fold preference of the enzyme for ErD over the alternative C-12 hydroxylase substrate ErB. Our results indicate that ErB is a shunt metabolite in the erythromycin biosynthetic pathway.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["R H Lambalot","D E Cane","J J Aparicio","L Katz"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T09:03:55+00:00","issns":["0006-2960"],"issue":"6","journal":"Biochemistry (00062979)","last_mentioned_on":1359704050,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7849045"],"pmid":"7849045","pubdate":"1995-02-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Overproduction and characterization of the erythromycin C-12 hydroxylase, EryK.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/overproduction-characterization-erythromycin-c12-hydroxylase-eryk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627150,"mean":4.9502167410311,"rank":817744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627150,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97067,"mean":8.0766102651805,"rank":25101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":70879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97067,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5464,"mean":2.4715899688816,"rank":229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5464,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":1.356914893617,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
