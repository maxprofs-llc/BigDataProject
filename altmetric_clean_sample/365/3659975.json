The new species differs from its congeners by having the following combination of characters: a long medial cephalic lobe about one-third the length of the body; an armature of five spines on the distal exopodal segment of leg 2; one long apical seta on the papillose leg 4; a caudal ramus armed with one medial and four terminal setae (two middle setae are inflated); and spinulose ornamentation covering the body. Procolobomatus hoi n. sp. is the first member of the genus reported from the western Pacific Ocean and from a host of the family Lutjanidae. Previous records of philichthyid copepods from Asian waters are also reported.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008ab9","authors":["Ione Madinabeitia","Sadaharu Iwasaki"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11230-012-9398-z","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T10:27:37+00:00","issns":["1573-5192"],"journal":"Systematic Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1365085069,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s11230-012-9398-z"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11230-012-9398-z.pdf","pmid":"23404758","pubdate":"2013-02-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"A new species of Procolobomatus Castro Romero, 1994 (Copepoda: Philichthyidae) endoparasitic in a deepwater longtail red snapper (Actinopterygii: Lutjanidae) off Ishigaki Island, Japan, with records of philichthyid copepods reported from Asian waters","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-species-procolobomatus-castro-romero-1994-copepoda-philichthyidae-endoparasitic-deepwater-longta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629356,"mean":4.9352152798544,"rank":816513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290054,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629356,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97638,"mean":8.1593750524905,"rank":25349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97638,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166,"mean":2.5940848484848,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.9,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Procolobomatus","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=548666582#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3659975],"posted_on":"2013-04-04T14:17:49+00:00","summary":"Procolobomatus is a genus of copepod, containing the following species: Procolobomatus hemilutjani Castro-Romero, 1994Procolobomatus hoi Madinabeitia & Iwasaki, 2013Procolobomatus kyphosus (Sekerak, 1970).","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=39011311","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Elspooky","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Elspooky"}}]}}
