A small set of co-affected genes was identified. One of these genes encoding the synaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 is downregulated in the striatum of all three mutants and in chronically, but not acutely, cocaine-treated mice. At the synaptic level, enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) of the frontocortico-accumbal glutamatergic synapses correlates with PSD-95 reduction in every case. Finally, targeted deletion of PSD-95 in an independent line of mice enhances LTP, augments the acute locomotor-stimulating effects of cocaine, but leads to no further behavioral plasticity in response to chronic cocaine. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated role of PSD-95 in psychostimulant action and identify a molecular and cellular mechanism shared between drug-related plasticity and learning.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319c","authors":["Wei-Dong Yao","Raul R Gainetdinov","Margaret I Arbuckle","Tatyana D Sotnikova","Michel Cyr","Jean-Martin Beaulieu","Gonzalo E Torres","Seth G.N Grant","Marc G Caron","Yao, Wei-Dong","Gainetdinov, Raul R","Arbuckle, Margaret I","Sotnikova, Tatyana D","Cyr, Michel","Beaulieu, Jean-Martin","Torres, Gonzalo E","Grant, Seth G N","Caron, Marc G"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0896-6273(04)00048-0","endpage":"638","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T07:24:07+00:00","issns":["0896-6273","08966273"],"issue":"4","journal":"Neuron","last_mentioned_on":1397930488,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/s0896-6273(04)00048-0"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S0896627304000480\/pdf","pmid":"14980210","pubdate":"2004-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"625","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Identification of PSD-95 as a Regulator of Dopamine-Mediated Synaptic and Behavioral Plasticity","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0896627304000480","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-psd95-regulator-dopaminemediated-synaptic-behavioral-plasticity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3671668,"mean":4.9522048742478,"rank":829911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2317773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3671668,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104587,"mean":8.6290838353126,"rank":29011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":74423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104587,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3811,"mean":10.170441469816,"rank":1426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3811,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":28.39392,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":43,"Student  > Ph.
