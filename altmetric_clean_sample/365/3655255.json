Strain Gsoil 348(T) is mesophilic, strictly aerobic, non-motile and rod-shaped. It only grows in low nutrient media. The major respiratory quinones are menaquinones MK-11 and MK-10, and the main fatty acids are iso-C(15:0), iso-C(17:0), C(16:0) and C(16:1) \u03c911c. The G+C content is 61.4 mol%. The 16S rRNA gene sequences in public databases belonging to the phylum Armatimonadetes were clustered here into 6 groups. Five of these groups constituted a coherent cluster distinct from the sequences of other phyla in phylogenetic trees that were constructed using multiple-outgroup sequences from 49 different phyla. On the basis of polyphasic taxonomic analyses, it is proposed that strain Gsoil 348(T) (= KACC 14959(T) = JCM 17079(T)) should be placed in Fimbriimonas ginsengisoli gen. nov., sp. nov., as the cultured representative of the Fimbriimonadia class. nov., corresponding with Group 4 of the phylum Armatimonadetes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f6100064e7","authors":["Wan-Taek Im","Zi-Ye Hu","Kyoung-Ho Kim","Sung-Keun Rhee","Han Meng","Sung-Taik Lee","Zhe-Xue Quan"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10482-012-9739-6","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T07:43:42+00:00","issns":["1572-9699"],"journal":"Antonie van Leeuwenhoek","last_mentioned_on":1453856617,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/m213r21t1g2603q3\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10482-012-9739-6","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22527625"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10482-012-9739-6.pdf","pmid":"22527625","pubdate":"2012-04-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Soil Science & Conservation","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Description of Fimbriimonas ginsengisoli gen. nov., sp. nov. within the Fimbriimonadia class nov., of the phylum Armatimonadetes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/description-fimbriimonas-ginsengisoli-gen-nov-sp-nov-within-fimbriimonadia-class-nov-phylum-armatimo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7054473,"mean":6.2693339663096,"rank":1657098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4558967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7054473,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245108,"mean":8.0738988033798,"rank":69029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":172131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245108,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":745,"mean":1.8461666666667,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":745,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":0.78867924528302,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
