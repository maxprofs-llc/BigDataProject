Here, we present data on the inorganic ion composition and total osmotic concentration of five different species of tardigrades (Echiniscus testudo, Milnesium tardigradum, Richtersius coronifer, Macrobiotus cf. hufelandi and Halobiotus crispae) using high-performance liquid chromatography and nanoliter osmometry. Quantification of the ionic content indicates that Na(+) and Cl(-) are the principal inorganic ions in tardigrade fluids, albeit other ions, i.e. K(+), NH4(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), F(-), SO4(2-) and PO4(3-) were also detected. In limno-terrestrial tardigrades, the respective ions are concentrated by a large factor compared with that of the external medium (Na(+), \u00d770-800; K(+), \u00d720-90; Ca(2+) and Mg(2+), \u00d730-200; F(-), \u00d7160-1040, Cl(-), \u00d720-50; PO4(3-), \u00d7700-2800; SO4(2-), \u00d730-150). In contrast, in the marine species H. crispae, Na(+), Cl(-) and SO4(2-) are almost in ionic equilibrium with (brackish) salt water, while K(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+) and F(-) are only slightly concentrated (\u00d72-10). An anion deficit of ~120 mEq l(-1) in M. tardigradum and H. crispae indicates the presence of unidentified ionic components in these species. Body fluid osmolality ranges from 361\u00b149 mOsm kg(-1) in R. coronifer to 961\u00b143 mOsm kg(-1) in H. crispae. Concentrations of most inorganic ions are largely identical between active and dehydrated groups of R. coronifer, suggesting that this tardigrade does not lose large quantities of inorganic ions during dehydration. The large osmotic and ionic gradients maintained by both limno-terrestrial and marine species are indicative of a powerful ion-retentive mechanism in Tardigrada. Moreover, our data indicate that cryptobiotic tardigrades contain a large fraction of unidentified organic osmolytes, the identification of which is expected to provide increased insight into the phenomenon of cryptobiosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002d97","authors":["Kenneth Agerlin Halberg","Kristine Wulff Larsen","Aslak J\u00f8rgensen","Hans Raml\u00f8v","Nadja M\u00f8bjerg"],"doi":"10.1242\/jeb.075531","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T05:48:19+00:00","issns":["1477-9145"],"journal":"Journal of Experimental Biology","last_mentioned_on":1408117248,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1242\/jeb.075531"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jeb.biologists.org\/content\/216\/7\/1235.full.pdf","pmid":"23239888","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Inorganic ion composition in Tardigrada: cryptobionts contain a large fraction of unidentified organic solutes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inorganic-ion-composition-tardigrada-cryptobionts-contain-large-fraction-unidentified-organic-solute"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4143352,"mean":5.1107237333896,"rank":965291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2615339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4143352,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140958,"mean":9.0884706825488,"rank":43616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":95368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140958,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2956,"mean":7.6827228426396,"rank":1061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":1563,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2956,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":8.3838717948718,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
