Our objective was to determine the oxylipins formed from linoleic acid by A. clavatus and their mechanism of biosynthesis. A. clavatus oxidized linoleic acid to (8R)-hydroperoxylinoleic acid (8R-HPODE), (10R)-hydroperoxy-8(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (10R-HPODE), and to (5S,8R)-dihydroxy- and (8R,11S)-dihydroxylinoleic acids (DiHODE) as major products. This occurred by abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen at C-8 and antarafacial dioxygenation at C-8 or at C-10 with double bond migration. 8R-HPODE was then isomerized to 5S,8R-DiHODE and to 8R,11S-DiHODE by abstraction of the pro-S hydrogens at C-5 and C-11 of 8R-HPODE, respectively, followed by suprafacial oxygenation. The genome of A. clavatus codes for two enzymes, which can be aligned with >65% amino acid identity to 10R-DOX and 5,8-LDS, respectively. The 5,8-LDS homologue likely forms and isomerizes 8R-HPODE to 5S,8R-DiHODE. A third gene (ppoB) codes for a protein which carries a serine residue at the cysteine position of the P450 motif. This Cys to Ser replacement is known to abolish P450 2B4 catalysis and the hydroperoxide isomerase activity of 5,8-LDS, suggesting that ppoB of A. clavatus may not be involved in the biosynthesis of 8R,11S-DiHODE.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","doi":"10.1016\/j.bbalip.2009.12.012","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T08:53:40+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1370214641,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bbalip.2009.12.012","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20045744"],"pmid":"20045744","pubdate":"2010-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Reaction mechanism of 5,8-linoleate diol synthase, 10R-dioxygenase, and 8,11-hydroperoxide isomerase of Aspergillus clavatus.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reaction-mechanism-58linoleate-diol-synthase-10rdioxygenase-811hydroperoxide-isomerase-aspergillus-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634284,"mean":4.9206846148246,"rank":815933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2296210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634284,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98668,"mean":8.2260734592115,"rank":25798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98668,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3852,"mean":2.5357917424046,"rank":256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3852,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":0.90031578947368,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
