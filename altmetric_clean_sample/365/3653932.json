Low-temperature NMR (13C, 19F, and 1H) monitoring of a reaction between bis(trifluoromethyl)ketene (1) and ethyl vinyl ether (2) has shown that the Staudinger reaction proceeds to form initially and exclusively an alpha-methyleneoxetane (3) by [2 + 2](C=O) cycloaddition across the ketene C=O bond. The initial intermediate 3 undergoes ring cleavage to produce a 1,4-zwitterion (4), which is converted to the final [2 + 2](C=C)-type product, cyclobutanone (5). The key intermediate 3 has been isolated in its pure form and was found to be converted to the final products 5 on warming, via the 1,4-zwitterion 4. The alpha-methyleneoxetane 3 is so reactive that it reacts with methanol rapidly even at -80 degrees C via solvolysis to afford an adduct 7. The ion 4 derived from the pure isolated oxetane 3 was intercepted with acetone by a 1,4-dipolar cycloaddition to give a 1,3-dioxane 8. An open-chain alpha,beta-enone (6) has been also obtained from 3. We conclude that the (1 + 2) reaction proceeds in a new three-step mechanism; formation of an alpha-methyleneoxetane 3, a [2 + 2]-type cycloadduct across the C=O bond of ketene, followed by ring cleavage to give the zwitterion 4 and by recombination to form the final product, cyclobutanone 5. The zwitterion 4 is not equilibrating with reactants 1 and 2 but comes from the alpha-methyleneoxetane 3. Exclusive formation of another oxetane 12 has been observed in a reaction between diphenylketene (9) and methyl isopropenyl ether (11). The selectivity of initial formation of cyclobutanone or oxetane has been generalized with aid of frontier-orbital theory and ab initio calculations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Takahisa Machiguchi,*,\u2020"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja030191g","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T07:07:15+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1299402282,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/ja030191g","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14624592"],"pmid":"14624592","pubdate":"2003-11-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Exclusive formation of alpha-methyleneoxetanes in ketene-alkene cycloadditions.
