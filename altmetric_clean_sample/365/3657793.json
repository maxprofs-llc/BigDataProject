We hypothesize that these defects may exist in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Both the upstream and downstream aspects of WCP were examined in MCL cell lines and tumors. Using WCP-specific oligonucleotide arrays, we found that MCL highly and consistently expressed Wnt3 and Wnt10. beta-catenin, a transcriptional factor that is a downstream target of WCP, is localized to the nucleus and transcriptionally active in all 3 MCL cell lines examined. By immunohistochemistry, 33 (52%) of 64 MCL tumors showed nuclear localization of beta-catenin, which significantly correlated with the expression of the phosphorylated\/inactive form of GSK3beta (p-GSK3beta; P = .011, Fisher). GSK3beta inactivation is directly linked to WCP stimulation, since addition of recombinant sFRP proteins (a naturally occurring decoy for the Wnt receptors) resulted in a significant decrease in p-GSK3beta. Down-regulation of DvL-2 (an upstream signaling protein in WCP) by siRNA or selective inhibition of beta-catenin using quercetin significantly decreased cell growth in MCL cell lines. To conclude, WCP is constitutively activated in a subset of MCL and it appears to promote tumorigenesis in MCL.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Pascal Gelebart","Mona Anand","Hanan Armanious","Anthea C.
