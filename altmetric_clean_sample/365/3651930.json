Initially, the problem may seem to be loss of elementary vision, but over time the patient develops features of visual agnosia, topographical difficulty, optic ataxia, simultanagnosia, ocular apraxia (Balint's syndrome), alexia, acalculia, right-left confusion, and agraphia (Gerstmann's syndrome), and later a more generalized dementia. Occasional patients have visual hallucinations and signs of Parkinson's disease or Lewy body dementia. A number of different neuropathologic disorders are associated with posterior cortical atrophy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007063","authors":["Kirshner HS","Lavin PJ"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T06:04:59+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"6","journal":"Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports","last_mentioned_on":1338611814,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17074282"],"pmid":"17074282","pubdate":"2006-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Posterior cortical atrophy: a brief review.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/posterior-cortical-atrophy-brief-review-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627150,"mean":4.9502167410311,"rank":817750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285983,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627150,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97065,"mean":8.0762115923515,"rank":25098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":70880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97065,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237,"mean":2.4464661016949,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.2714285714286,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
