In North America, reductions in population smoking levels are stabilising and, in recent years, those involved in tobacco control programming have turned their attention to particular segments of society that are at greatest risk for tobacco use. One such group is people with mental illness. A picture of tobacco use patterns among those with mental illness is beginning to emerge; however, there are several unanswered questions. In particular, most studies have been limited to particular in-patient groups. In addition, while it is recognised that men and women differ in relation to their reasons for smoking, levels of addiction to nicotine, and difficulties with cessation, these sex and gender differences have not been fully explored in psychiatric populations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d7","authors":["Joy L Johnson","Pamela A Ratner","Leslie A Malchy","Chizimuzo TC Okoli","Ric M Procyshyn","Joan L Bottorff","Marlee Groening","Annette Schultz","Marg Osborne","Johnson JL","Ratner PA","Malchy LA","Okoli CT","Procyshyn RM","Bottorff JL","Groening M","Schultz A","Osborne M"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-244x-10-101","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T07:44:11+00:00","issns":["1471-244X",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1370231539,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-244X-10-101","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186%2F1471-244X-10-101","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21118563"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-244X-10-101.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3002315","pmid":"21118563","pubdate":"2010-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Gender-specific profiles of tobacco use among non-institutionalized people with serious mental illness.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genderspecific-profiles-tobacco-among-noninstitutionalized-people-serious-mental-illness"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3989098,"mean":5.0355800489838,"rank":917215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3989098,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133030,"mean":9.0945137040882,"rank":40515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":90737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133030,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1361,"mean":5.0926161764706,"rank":578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1361,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":5.2780967741935,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
