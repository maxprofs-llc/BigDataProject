The reprogrammed cells are larger, contain altered organelle and cytoskeletal structures, are phagocytic, and exhibit an inflammatory response. Time-lapse experiments showed that the cells acquire a macrophage morphology and increased migratory activity as early as 10 hr. During induction, thousands of genes become up- or downregulated, including several dozen transcription and chromatin-remodeling factors. Time-limited exposure of cells to the inducer showed that the reprogrammed cells become transgene independent within 1 to 2 days. The reprogramming can be inhibited, at least partially, by perturbation experiments with B cell and macrophage transcription factors. The tightness, robustness, and speed of the system described make it a versatile tool to study biochemical and biological aspects of lineage reprogramming.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e1f","doi":"10.1016\/j.stem.2009.10.004","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T05:08:28+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Cell Stem Cell","last_mentioned_on":1392876582,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.stem.2009.10.004"],"pmid":"19896445","pubdate":"2009-06-10T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"A robust and highly efficient immune cell reprogramming system.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/robust-highly-efficient-immune-cell-reprogramming-system"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626596,"mean":4.9527436744422,"rank":817898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626596,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96930,"mean":8.063861279906,"rank":25035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":70807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96930,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":918,"mean":14.504863685932,"rank":573,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":918,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":25.763,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":31,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
