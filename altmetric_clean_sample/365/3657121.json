The active enzyme has been solubilized in the detergent dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside and purified by standard chromatographic techniques. This is the first purification of an ammonia monooxygenase. The enzyme consists of two subunits with molecular masses of 38 and 46 kDa. The purified enzyme is a quinol oxidase, is inhibited by light and a variety of chelating agents and is activated by cupric ions. These properties indicate that this enzyme has similarities to a family of enzymes including the ammonia monooxygenase from Nitrosomonas europaea and the particulate methane monooxygenase from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b7","doi":"10.1016\/0014-5793(96)00463-2","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T09:09:08+00:00","issns":["0014-5793"],"journal":"Febs Letters","last_mentioned_on":1359915286,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/0014-5793(96)00463-2","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8654570"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.febsletters.org\/article\/0014579396004632\/pdf","pmid":"8654570","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The purification of ammonia monooxygenase from Paracoccus denitrificans.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/purification-ammonia-monooxygenase-paracoccus-denitrificans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3617832,"mean":4.9279282509359,"rank":815414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2278720,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3617832,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95413,"mean":7.187298746489,"rank":24110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":70225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95413,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3393,"mean":2.6258567216981,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":870,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3393,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.4727272727273,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":26,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
