We have examined the expression of Mrp2 in yeast mutants lacking mitochondrial DNA and found that the steady-state level of Mrp2 is dramatically decreased relative to wild type. These data suggest that the accumulation of Mrp2 depends on the expression of one or more mitochondrial gene products. The mitochondrial genome of S. cerevisiae encodes two components of the small ribosomal subunit, 15S rRNA and the Var1 protein, both of which are necessary for the formation of mature 37S subunits. Several studies have shown that in the absence of Var1 incomplete subunits accumulate, which lack a limited number of ribosomal proteins. Here, we show that Mrp2 is one of the proteins absent from subunits lacking Var1, indicating that Var1 plays an important role in the incorporation of Mrp2 into mitochondrial ribosomal subunits.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081db","authors":["S C Davis","S R Ellis"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T05:23:07+00:00","issns":["0026-8925"],"issue":"3","journal":"Molecular and General Genetics MGG","last_mentioned_on":1342517000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7770043"],"pmid":"7770043","pubdate":"1995-05-10T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["molecularbiology","genetics"],"title":"Incorporation of the yeast mitochondrial ribosomal protein Mrp2 into ribosomal subunits requires the mitochondrially encoded Var1 protein.","type":"article","volume":"247","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/incorporation-yeast-mitochondrial-ribosomal-protein-mrp2-ribosomal-subunits-requires-mitochondrially"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628651,"mean":4.9397870194191,"rank":816947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628651,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97510,"mean":8.1408130326433,"rank":25297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97510,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200,"mean":3.012391959799,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Var1 protein domain","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=502765250#altmetric_citation_1","license":"public","citation_ids":[3650657,3650662],"posted_on":"2012-07-17T09:23:20+00:00","summary":"In molecular biology, VAR1 protein domain, otherwise known as variant protein 1, is a ribosomal protein that forms part of the small ribosomal subunit in yeast mitochondria.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=36460485","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Kfh123","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Kfh123"}}]}}
