Specimens of the following were prepared as 6 mm diameter, 2 mm thick discs; BPC mixed with CMC (the BCP\/CMC group), BCP mixed with crosslinked CMC (the BCP\/c-CMC group) and BCP mixed with HyA (the BCP\/HyA group) and a control group (specimens were prepared using particle type BCP). A scanning electron microscope study, a compressive strength analysis, and a cytotoxicity assessment were conducted. Graft materials were implanted in each of four circular defects of 6 mm diameter in calvarial bone in seven rabbits. Animals were sacrificed after four weeks for micro-CT and histomorphometric analyses, and the findings obtained were used to calculate new bone volumes (mm\u00b3) and area percentages (%). It was found that these two values were significantly higher in the BCP\/c-CMC group than in the other three groups (p < 0.05). Within the limitations of this study, BCP composite block bone graft material incorporating crosslinked CMC has potential utility when bone augmentation is needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041bc","authors":["Hyun-Sang Yoo"],"doi":"10.3390\/ma10010017","first_seen_on":"2017-01-01T03:16:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1996-1944"],"issue":"1","journal":"Materials (1996-1944)","last_mentioned_on":1483240575,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/10\/1\/17?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/10\/1\/17?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/10\/1\/17\/pdf","pmid":"28772381","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"17","title":"The Effect of Bisphasic Calcium Phosphate Block Bone Graft Materials with Polysaccharides on Bone Regeneration","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-bisphasic-calcium-phosphate-block-bone-graft-materials-polysaccharides-bone-regeneration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7971101,"mean":6.7313029448827,"rank":4184686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2225505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7971101,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253389,"mean":12.528401850127,"rank":142464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":86663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253389,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1017,"mean":0.89934448818898,"rank":176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1017,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":217,"mean":0.85601851851852,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":217,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Chemistry":1,"Chemical Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PhiLifeSciences\/statuses\/815396140136873984","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15177313],"posted_on":"2017-01-01T03:16:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Phi Life Sciences","url":"http:\/\/www.philifesciences.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/785955844135407617\/tIqFI_Li_normal.jpg","description":"Phi Life Sciences is a Molecular  Diagnostic and Laboratory Service company.","id_on_source":"PhiLifeSciences","tweeter_id":"785955501959819265","geo":{"lt":32.77657,"ln":-79.93092,"country":"US"},"followers":175},"tweet_id":"815396140136873984"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/815396174593036288","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15177313],"posted_on":"2017-01-01T03:16:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/891043583511470080\/FfBKDjay_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
