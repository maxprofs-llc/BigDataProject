Likelihood ratio tests and stratified analysis were used to investigate physical activity and body mass index as potential effect modifiers.\nBiomarker-calibrated protein intake was positively associated with percent lean mass; women in the highest protein quintile had 6.3 percentage points higher lean mass than the lowest quintile (P<0.001). This difference rose to 8.5 percentage points for physically active women in the highest protein quintile (Pinteraction=0.023). Percent fat mass and lean body mass index were both inversely related to protein intake (both P<0.001). Physical activity further reduced percent fat mass (Pinteraction=0.022) and lean body mass index (Pinteraction=0.011). Leucine intake was associated with lean mass, as were branched chain amino acids combined (both P<0.001), but not independent of total protein. All associations were observed for normal-weight, overweight, and obese women.\nProtein consumption up to 2.02 g\/kg body weight daily is positively associated with lean mass in postmenopausal women. Importantly, those that also engage in physical activity have the highest lean mass across body mass index categories.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e8b","authors":["Martinez, Jessica A","Wertheim, Betsy C","Thomson, Cynthia A","Bea, Jennifer W","Wallace, Robert","Allison, Matthew","Snetselaar, Linda","Chen, Zhao","Nassir, Rami","Thompson, Patricia A","Jessica A.
