We analysed the level of metabolic control achieved and blood glucose-lowering medication used in different age groups and in relation to accompanying diseases.\n4.459 patients (59.1%) were 65\u00a0years or older. Their HbA1c levels were similar to those with <65\u00a0years. 44.7% of patients \u226565\u00a0years had an HbA1c \u22647% (53\u00a0mmol\/mol) and were treated with insulin or sulfonylureas, and 27.1% of them had ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure. Significantly more patients with heart disease had HbA1c values \u22647% (53\u00a0mmol\/mol) and were treated more often with insulin or sulfonylureas compared to patients of the same age without heart disease.\nMost patients were treated according to guidelines valid at the time this large international patient sample was surveyed. Older and younger patients were at a similar level of metabolic control, and almost half of the patients with an age of \u226565\u00a0years and treated with insulin or sulfonylurea had HbA1c levels below the target range (\u22647%) for younger patients. However, these patients have an increased risk of severe hypoglycaemic events with potentially dangerous complications, particularly in those with cardiovascular diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000214c","authors":["M\u00fcller, Nicolle","Khunti, Kamlesh","Kuss, Oliver","Lindblad, Ulf","Nolan, John J","Rutten, Guy Ehm","Trento, Marina","Porta, Massimo","Roth, Johannes","Charpentier, Guillaume","J\u00f6rgens, Viktor","M\u00fcller, Ulrich A","Nicolle M\u00fcller","Kamlesh Khunti","Oliver Kuss","Ulf Lindblad","John J.
