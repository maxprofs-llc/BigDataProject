We sought to characterize variations in hospital costs after major surgery and quantitate the variability attributable to the patient, procedure, and provider.\nA total of 22,559 patients undergoing major surgical procedure at a tertiary-care center between 2009 and 2013 were identified. Hierarchical linear regression analysis was performed to calculate risk-adjusted fixed, variable and total costs.\nThe median cost of surgery was $23,845 (interquartile ranges, 13,353 to 43,083). Factors associated with increased costs included insurance status (Medicare vs private; coefficient: 14,934; 95% CI = 12,445.7 to 17,422.5, P < .001), preoperative comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index\u00a0= 1; coefficient: 10,793; 95% CI = 8,412.7 to 13,174.2; Charlson Comorbidity Index \u22652; coefficient: 24,468; 95% CI = 22,552.7 to 26,383.6; both P < .001) and the development of a postoperative complication (coefficient: 58,624.1; 95% CI = 56,683.6 to 60,564.7; P < .001). Eighty-six percent of total variability was explained by patient-related factors, whereas 8% of the total variation was attributed to surgeon practices and 6% due to factors at the level of surgical specialty.\nAlthough inpatient costs varied markedly between procedures and providers, the majority of variation in costs was due to patient-level factors and should be targeted by future cost containment strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221f","authors":["Faiz Gani","John Hundt","Michael Daniel","Jonathan E.
