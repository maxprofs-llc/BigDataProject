A survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier) of the 36-month follow-up period was performed to compare the single treatment groups. End-point was considered as discontinuation of treatment for recurrence, side effects or non-compliance.\nPatients treated with haloperidol discontinued more than the other groups (Breslow: risperidone p\u2009<\u20090.001, olanzapine p\u2009<\u20090.001, quetiapine p\u2009=\u20090.002, clozapine p\u2009<\u20090.001, aripiprazole p\u2009=\u20090.002). Lack of efficacy (recurrence) was a more frequent reason for discontinuation in the haloperidol group than in the olanzapine group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) were more frequent in the haloperidol group than with olanzapine (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The olanzapine group presented more frequently weight gain than the other groups, without reaching statistical significance.\nPatients treated with atypical antipsychotics appear to continue pharmacotherapy longer than patients treated with haloperidol. In addition, atypical antipsychotics seem to be more protective against recurrences than haloperidol. However, these results should be cautiously interpreted in the light of potential confounder factors such as duration of illness.
