An RDI reduction from 35.4\u2009\u00b1\u200938.5 to 16.0\u2009\u00b1\u200919.7 was found, corresponding to a mean decrease of 54.6\u00a0% (p\u2009=\u20090.0013). A 56.2\u00a0% (33.23\u2009\u00b1\u200939.5 to 14.5\u2009\u00b1\u200919.4, p\u2009=\u20090.001) decrease was found in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), in addition to decreases in the desaturation and microarousal rates, among other parameters. The ESS scores improved from 12.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3 to 7.2\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5 (p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nSARME promotes an improvement in OSAS symptoms; decreases the rates of respiratory disturbances; microarousal, and desaturation; and reduces daytime sleepiness.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f61000894b","authors":["Pedro Pileggi Vinha","Alan Luiz Eckeli","Ana C\u00e9lia Faria","Samuel Porfirio Xavier","Francisco Ver\u00edssimo de Mello-Filho"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11325-015-1214-y","first_seen_on":"2017-03-30T12:11:19+00:00","issns":["1520-9512","1522-1709"],"journal":"Sleep and Breathing","last_mentioned_on":1490875346,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26092279?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26092279","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Otorhinolaryngology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pneumology\/Respiratory System","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Effects of surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion on obstructive sleep apnea and daytime sleepiness","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s11325-015-1214-y","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-surgically-assisted-rapid-maxillary-expansion-obstructive-sleep-apnea-daytime-sleepiness-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":7289362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249270,"mean":13.229560506922,"rank":206258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249270,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":736,"mean":2.6225931972789,"rank":549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":736,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.5615384615385,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SleepResearch_\/statuses\/847418740757086211","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18284839],"posted_on":"2017-03-30T12:02:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Sleep Research","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Sleep-Research\/105093012946768?ref=hl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2694954403\/9f320ff3ac0d13ed3582e204a8c1c768_normal.jpeg","description":"Highlights and news from the latest research on sleep","id_on_source":"SleepResearch_","tweeter_id":"868205960","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1623},"tweet_id":"847418740757086211"}]}}
