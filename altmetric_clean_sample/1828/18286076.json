Aim of the study was to assess the impact of cachexia on head and neck changes during definitive cisplatin and image-guided volumetric-modulated arc radiation therapy in a series of locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer.\nVolume variations of sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) were considered as surrogate of muscle changes related to sarcopenia. Two head and neck diameters, encompassing the cranial limits of II and III nodal levels (defined as 'head diameter' and 'neck diameter', respectively), were measured. All parameters were defined retrospectively by means of on-board cone beam computed tomography images at 1-8th to 15-22th and at last fraction (fx) of radiotherapy (RT). Cachexia was defined as WL >5% during treatment. Analysis was conducted correlating the parameter changes with three WL ranges: <5, 5-9 and>10%.\nThirty patients were evaluated. One hundred and fifty contoured SCMs and three hundred diameters were collected. Median WL was 6.5% (range, 0-16%). The most significant SCM shrinkage was recorded at 15th fx (mean 1.6 cc) related to WL 5-9% and WL >10% (P 0.001). For 'head diameter', the peak reduction was recorded at the 15th fx (mean 8\u2009mm), statistically correlated to WL >10% (P 0.001). The peak reduction in 'neck diameter' was registered at the 22th fx (mean 6\u2009mm), with a gradual reduction until the end of treatment for WL >5%.\nIn a homogeneous cohort of patients, present study quantified the impact of cachexia on head and neck changes. Present data could provide adaptive RT implications for further investigations.European Journal of Clinical Nutrition advance online publication, 13 April 2016; doi:10.1038\/ejcn.2016.61.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002829","authors":["R Mazzola","F Ricchetti","A Fiorentino","G Di Paola","S Fersino","N Giaj Levra","R Ruggieri","F Alongi","R Mazzola","F Ricchetti","A Fiorentino","G Di Paola","S Fersino","N Giaj Levra","R Ruggieri","F Alongi"],"doi":"10.1038\/ejcn.2016.61","first_seen_on":"2017-03-30T12:39:03+00:00","issns":["0954-3007","1476-5640"],"journal":"European Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1490870094,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ejcn.2016.61"],"pmid":"27071508","pubdate":"2016-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oral cancer","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Cachexia induces head and neck changes in locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma during definitive cisplatin and image-guided volumetric-modulated arc radiation therapy","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ejcn.2016.61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cachexia-induces-head-neck-changes-locally-advanced-oropharyngeal-carcinoma-during-definitive-cispla"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":10,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":868510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7531901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249270,"mean":13.229586984342,"rank":41167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":207271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249270,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2286,"mean":13.037025820569,"rank":654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":1595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2286,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":8.669375,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Food groups associated with a reduced risk of 15-year all-cause death","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=30067033754&p=1pl&v=1&x=S33CHJm6iXoqxJwe8AEu4g","license":"public","citation_ids":[18286076],"posted_on":"2017-03-30T10:34:54+00:00","summary":"To read this article in full you may need to log in, make a payment or gain access through a site license (see right).","author":{"name":"Nature","url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/076\/normal\/image.png?1369859733"}}]}}
