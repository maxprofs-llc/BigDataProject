The first quality of exceptional leaders is that they selectively reveal their weaknesses (weaknesses, not fatal flaws). Doing so lets employees see that they are approachable. It builds an atmosphere of trust and helps galvanize commitment. The second quality of inspirational leaders is their heavy reliance on intuition to gauge the appropriate timing and course of their actions. Such leaders are good \"situation sensors\"--they can sense what's going on without having things spelled out for them. Managing employees with \"tough empathy\" is the third quality of exceptional leadership. Tough empathy means giving people what they need, not what they want. Leaders must empathize passionately and realistically with employees, care intensely about the work they do, and be straightforward with them. The fourth quality of top-notch leaders is that they capitalize on their differences. They use what's unique about themselves to create a social distance and to signal separateness, which in turn motivates employees to perform better. All four qualities are necessary for inspirational leadership, but they cannot be used mechanically; they must be mixed and matched to meet the demands of particular situations. Most important, however, is that the qualities encourage authenticity among leaders. To be a true leader, the authors advise, \"Be yourself--more--with skill.\"","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5933cf058f610004f63","authors":["Goffee, R","Jones, G"],"first_seen_on":"2017-01-09T02:30:45+00:00","issns":["0017-8012"],"issue":"5","journal":"Harvard Business Review","last_mentioned_on":1484087852,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11143155"],"pmid":"11143155","pubdate":"2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Business And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Marketing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Business, Management and Accounting","Economics, Econometrics and Finance"],"subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Why should anyone be led by you?","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anyone-led-23"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8277902,"mean":6.9833214656645,"rank":7158489,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8277902,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269533,"mean":12.509367770802,"rank":221593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269533,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":4.1583958333333,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
