The impact of MDAs on malaria transmission depends largely on the efficacy of the anti-malarial drug regimen, the malaria epidemiology in the site and the population coverage. To explore why some people participate in MDAs and others do not, a quantitative survey of the villagers' perceptions was undertaken in Vietnam.\nIn 2013\/2014 MDAs were conducted in a village in Binh Phuoc province and a village in Ninh Thuan province. Within three months of the drug administration, 59 respondents in a village in Binh Phuoc and 79 respondents in a village in Ninh Thuan were randomly selected and interviewed.\nComprehension of the purpose of the intervention was of paramount importance for participation in the intervention. Respondents aware that the intervention aims to protect against malaria were significantly more likely to participate than respondents who were unaware of the MDA's purpose. Secondly, how and by whom villagers were informed was critical for participation. There was a strong association between sensitization by an informant such as a member of the local health team with participation in the intervention.\nThe study suggests several approaches to increase participation in mass drug administration campaigns. Training trustworthy informants to sensitize the study population is critical to maximize village participation in this setting. To achieve high coverage the entire community must understand and agree with the intervention.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086b","authors":["Nguyen, Thuy-Nhien","Thu, Pham N Huong","Hung, Ngo Trong","Son, Do Hung","Tien, Nguyen Thanh","Van Dung, Nguyen","Quang, Huynh Hong","Seidlein, Lorenz von","Cheah, Phaik Yeong","Dondorp, Arjen M","Day, Nicholas P J","White, Nicholas J","Hien, Tran Tinh","Thuy-Nhien Nguyen","Pham N.
