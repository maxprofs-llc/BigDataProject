The aim of this study was to apply UV irradiation in dried lemon pomace powder for enhancing its phenolic content and antioxidant properties, thus more bioactive compounds should be available for extraction and utilization. Lemon pomace dried powder was placed under a UV lamp and treated with dosages of 4, 19, 80 and 185 kJ\u00b7m(-2), while untreated powder was used as a control. UV-C irradiation significantly affected the total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, proanthocyanidins, and antioxidant capacity measured by cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) of the lemon pomace dried powder, while it did not affect the vitamin C content. UV-C irradiation of 19 kJ\u00b7m(-2) resulted in 19% higher total phenolic content than the control, while UV-C irradiation of 180 kJ\u00b7m(-2) resulted in 28% higher total flavonoid content than the control. The antioxidant capacity was reduced when UV-C irradiation more than 4 kJ\u00b7m(-2) was applied. The results of this study indicate that UV-C treatment has the potential to increase the extraction of bioactive compounds of dried lemon pomace at relatively high dosages.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef822a83ee09648b541f","authors":["Konstantinos Papoutsis","Quan Vuong","Penta Pristijono","John Golding","Michael Bowyer","Christopher Scarlett","Costas Stathopoulos"],"doi":"10.3390\/foods5030055","first_seen_on":"2017-01-09T03:38:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2304-8158"],"issue":"3","journal":"Foods","last_mentioned_on":1484388206,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2304-8158\/5\/3\/55"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2304-8158\/5\/3\/55\/pdf","pmid":"28231150","pubdate":"2016-08-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","startpage":"55","title":"Enhancing the Total Phenolic Content and Antioxidants of Lemon Pomace Aqueous Extracts by Applying UV-C Irradiation to the Dried Powder","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enhancing-total-phenolic-content-antioxidants-lemon-pomace-aqueous-extracts-applying-uvc-irradiation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072166,"mean":6.8521645392475,"rank":3473775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4484006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072166,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255359,"mean":12.780848307082,"rank":109189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":142080,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255359,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":3.0113,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":3.05624,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
