The angiogenesis assay in vivo was used to measure the effects of \u03c9-3, \u03c9-6, PGE2 and PGE3 on neovascularization. In all the assays, groups without \u03c9-3, \u03c9-6, PGE2 and PGE3 were designed as the control.\nWith the increased concentration of \u03c9-6 from 1 \u03bcmol\/L to 10 \u03bcmol\/L, the proliferation ability of HUVECs enhanced, and the number of migration cells also increased from 28.2\u00b13.0 to 32.8\u00b12.1, which was higher than control group (21.2\u00b13.2) respectively (both P<0.05). With the increased concentration of \u03c9-3 from 1 \u03bcmol\/L to 10 \u03bcmol\/L, the proliferation ability of HUVECs was inhibited, and the number of migration cells decreased from 15.8\u00b12.0 to 11.0\u00b12.1, which was lower than control group (22.1\u00b13.0) respectively (both P<0.05). In the angiogenesis assay, compared with control group (standard number: 43 721\u00b14 654), the angiogenesis ability of HUVECs was significantly enhanced by \u03c9-6 in concentration-dependent manner (1 \u03bcmol\/L group: 63 238\u00b14 795, 10 \u03bcmol\/L group: 78 166\u00b16 123, all P<0.01). Meanwhile, with the increased concentration of \u03c9-3 from 1 \u03bcmol\/L to 10 \u03bcmol\/L, the angiogenesis ability was significantly decreased from 30 129\u00b13 102 to 20 012\u00b11 541(all P<0.01). The proliferation and migration ability of HUVECs were significantly promoted by \u03c9-6 metabolites PGE2 (P<0.05) in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, \u03c9-3 metabolites PGE3 significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration ability of HUVECs in a concentration-dependent manner (all P<0.05). After rofecoxib (a COX-2 specific inhibitor) inhibited the expression of COX-2, the expression level of PGE2 was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner. In co-culture system, whose gastric cancer cells expressed positive COX-2, \u03c9-6 could increase angiogenesis of gastric cancer cells(P<0.01), but \u03c9-3 could inhibit such angiogenesis(P<0.01). In co-culture system, whose gastric cancer cells did not express COX-2, \u03c9-3 could inhibit the angiogenesis of gastric cancer cells (P<0.05), but \u03c9-6 had no effect on angiogenesis.\nThe PUFA \u03c9-6 can enhance the angiogenesis via the promotion of proliferation and migration of HUVECs, and COX-2 and PGE2 may play an important role in this process, whereas, the \u03c9-3 can inhibit the angiogenesis through its middle metabolites PGE3 to inhibit the proliferation and migration of HUVECs. Results of this experiment may provide a new approach to inhibit and prevent the spread of gastric cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd2d","authors":["Ma, Jiachi","Ma, Yuntao","Guo, Tiankang","Chen, Quan","Li, Yiping","Su, He","Chen, Xiaochang","Zhao, Xiaodan","Guo, Qinjin","Qi, Jianbo"],"first_seen_on":"2017-03-17T09:55:21+00:00","issns":["1671-0274"],"issue":"1","journal":"Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery","last_mentioned_on":1489779950,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28105626"],"pmid":"28105626","pubdate":"2017-01-25T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","gastroenterology"],"title":"[Effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids \u03c9-3 and \u03c9-6 on angiogenesis formation in human gastric cancer].","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-%CF%893-%CF%896-angiogenesis-formation-human-gastric-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":1.35,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":4158653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4149849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265969,"mean":13.109204799073,"rank":135599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":127726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265969,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281,"mean":0.51535714285714,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.27083333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/expertomega3\/statuses\/842675661999407104","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17599770],"posted_on":"2017-03-17T09:55:08+00:00","author":{"name":"expertomega3","url":"http:\/\/www.expertomega3.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471694710658981888\/-wahE2DC_normal.png","description":"Expertomega3, experts in Omega-3 fatty acids.
