These variations were associated with the presence of aquatic vegetation as well as past secondary activities that occurred at the ponds. Here, methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB), which are direct participants in the nutrient cycles of aquatic environments and biological indicators of environmental variations, have been characterised via analysis of pmoA functional genes in the same environments. The MOB communities associated with disused tin-mining ponds that were exposed to varying secondary activities were examined in comparison to those in ponds that were left to nature. Comparing the sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the pmoA clone libraries at the different ponds (idle, lotus-cultivated and post-aquaculture), we found pmoA genes indicating the presence of type I and type II MOB at all study sites, but type Ib sequences affiliated with the Methylococcus\/Methylocaldum lineage were most ubiquitous (46.7\u00a0% of clones). Based on rarefaction analysis and diversity indices, the disused mining pond with lotus culture was observed to harbor the highest richness of MOB. However, varying secondary activity or sample type did not show a strong variation in community patterns as compared to the ammonia oxidizers in our previous study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003740","authors":["S L S Sow","G Khoo","L K Chong","T J Smith","P L Harrison","H K A Ong"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11274-014-1687-z","first_seen_on":"2014-06-16T14:41:28+00:00","issns":["1573-0972"],"journal":"World Journal of Microbiology & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1402929530,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24929362?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24929362","pubdate":"2014-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Engineering\/Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology"],"title":"Molecular diversity of the methanotrophic bacteria communities associated with disused tin-mining ponds in Kampar, Perak, Malaysia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-diversity-methanotrophic-bacteria-communities-associated-disused-tinmining-ponds-kampar-pe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3932997,"mean":5.022427570184,"rank":3138209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":96764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3932997,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94066,"mean":7.683879268552,"rank":74584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94066,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245,"mean":1.3243852459016,"rank":144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.48333333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
