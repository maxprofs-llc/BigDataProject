Because locally advanced pancreatic tumors can involve adjacent organs, \"extended\" pancreatectomy that includes the resection of additional organs may be needed to achieve this goal. Our aim was to develop a common consistent terminology to be used in centers reporting results of pancreatic resections for cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008a97","authors":["Hartwig W","Vollmer CM","Fingerhut A","Yeo CJ","Neoptolemos JP","Adham M","Andr\u00e9n-Sandberg A","Asbun HJ","Bassi C","Bockhorn M","Charnley R","Conlon KC","Dervenis C","Fernandez-Cruz L","Friess H","Gouma DJ","Imrie CW","Lillemoe KD","Mili\u0107evi\u0107 MN","Montorsi M","Shrikhande SV","Vashist YK","Izbicki JR","B\u00fcchler MW","Werner Hartwig","Charles M.
