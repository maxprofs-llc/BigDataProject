Here, we found that primary decidual stromal cells (DSCs) continuously secreted HA and expressed its receptor CD44. Pregnancy-associated hormones up-regulated HA synthetase (HAS) 2 transcription and HA release from DSCs. High molecular weight-HA (HMW-HA), but not medium molecular weight (MMW-HA) or low molecular weight (LMW-HA), promoted proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of DSCs in a CD44-dependent manner. The in-cell Western analysis revealed HMW-HA activated PI3K\/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)\/ERK1\/2 signaling pathways time-dependently. Blocking these pathways by specific inhibitor LY294002 or U0126 abrogated HMW-HA-regulated DSc proliferation and apoptosis. Finally, we have found that HA content, HA molecular weight, HAS2 mRNA level, and CD44 expression were significantly decreased in DSCs from unexplained miscarriage compared with the normal pregnancy. Collectively, our results indicate that higher level and greater molecular mass of HA at maternal-fetal interface contributes to DSc growth and maintenance of DSCs in human early pregnancy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Zhu R","Wang SC","Sun C","Tao Y","Piao HL","Wang XQ","Du MR","Da-Jin Li","Rui Zhu","Song-Cun Wang","Chan Sun","Yu Tao","Hai-Lan Piao","Xiao-Qiu Wang","Mei-Rong Du","Victor Sanchez-Margalet"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0074812","first_seen_on":"2014-06-16T14:56:33+00:00","issns":["","1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1494379033,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24069351","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24069351"],"pmid":"24069351","pubdate":"2013-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Hyaluronan-CD44 Interaction Promotes Growth of Decidual Stromal Cells in Human First-Trimester Pregnancy.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hyaluronancd44-interaction-promotes-growth-decidual-stromal-cells-human-firsttrimester-pregnancy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183022,"mean":6.92160443679,"rank":7081515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183022,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171885,"mean":7.4515284494196,"rank":138585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171885,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113606,"mean":10.57366242683,"rank":95876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113606,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2933,"mean":14.329658253752,"rank":2589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2933,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
