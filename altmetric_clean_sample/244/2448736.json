The introduction of this nosographic category has been helpful in drawing attention to a previously neglected area, but has not been successful in promoting an understanding of the disorders' biological basis and treatment implications, probably because of a series of diagnostic shortcomings. The newly proposed DSM-V diagnostic criteria try to overcome the limitations of the DSM-IV definition, which was organised centrally around the concept of medically unexplained symptoms, by emphasising the extent to which a patient's thoughts, feelings and behaviours concerning their somatic symptoms are disproportionate or excessive. This change is supported by a growing body of evidence showing that psychological and behavioural features play a major role in causing patient disability and maintaining high level of health care use. Pain disorders is the sub-category of DSM-IV somatoform disorders that most closely resembles fibromyalgia. Regardless of the diagnostic changes recently brought about by DSM-V, neuroimaging studies have identified important components of the mental processes associated with a DSM- IV diagnosis of pain disorder.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000d01c","authors":["A Alciati","F Atzeni","P Sgiarovello","P Sarzi-Puttini"],"doi":"10.4081\/reumatismo.2014.770","first_seen_on":"2014-06-19T10:02:12+00:00","issns":["0048-7449"],"issue":"1","journal":"Reumatismo","last_mentioned_on":1403881656,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24938202?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24938202?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24938202"],"pmid":"24938202","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Somatoform disorders and rheumatic diseases: from DSM-IV to DSM-V.","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/somatoform-disorders-rheumatic-diseases-dsmiv-dsmv"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":1910545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3108496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123931,"mean":8.0747554103125,"rank":38699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":84655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123931,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":1.3722619047619,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.65,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
