The prevalence of tularemia shows a wide geographic variation, being comparably infrequent in Germany. Tularemia can present itself with multiple clinical manifestations including ulceroglandular, glandular, oropharyngeal, oculoglandular, respiratory and typhoidal forms. Due to the low prevalence and the unspecific symptomatology, a rapid diagnosis and early start of an effective therapy are rarely obtained. Thus, in this article we summarize important aspects concerning etiology, ecology and routes of transmission, recent epidemiologic situation, clinical picture, diagnostics and treatment of tularemia, focusing on the situation in Germany.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f6100070e3","authors":["R Kohlmann","G Geis","S G Gatermann"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0034-1370117","first_seen_on":"2014-06-18T17:19:31+00:00","issns":["1439-4413"],"issue":"27","journal":"Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift","last_mentioned_on":1403111826,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24937079"],"pmid":"24937079","pubdate":"2014-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Tularemia in Germany.]","type":"article","volume":"139","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/die-tular%C3%A4mie-deutschland"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3569121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107562,"mean":7.8144081219031,"rank":82457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107562,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":346,"mean":2.1348637681159,"rank":227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":346,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.54166666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"SE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CampOther\/status\/479311856251568128","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2446864],"posted_on":"2014-06-18T17:17:06+00:00","author":{"name":"cAMP \u00d6ther","url":"http:\/\/campother.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/418967192097419264\/b84KterR_normal.jpeg","description":"Discussing tickborne infections, immunology, science, medical controversy, media portrayal of chronic illness, and the patient experience since 2010.","id_on_source":"CampOther","tweeter_id":"258870463","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1880},"tweet_id":"479311856251568128"}]}}
