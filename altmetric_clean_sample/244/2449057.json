For example, doublecortin (Dcx) knockdown but not knockout shows a neocortical neuronal migration phenotype. Here we report that in utero electroporation of shRNA, but not siRNA or miRNA, to Dcx demonstrates a migration phenotype in Dcx knockouts akin to the effect in wild-type mice, suggesting shRNA-mediated off-target toxicity. This effect was not limited to Dcx, as it was observed in Dclk1 knockouts, as well as with a fraction of scrambled shRNAs, suggesting a sequence-dependent but not sequence-specific effect. Profiling RNAs from electroporated cells showed a defect in endogenous let7 miRNA levels, and disruption of let7 or Dicer recapitulated the migration defect. The results suggest that shRNA-mediated knockdown can produce untoward migration effects by altering endogenous miRNA pathways.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319c","doi":"10.1016\/j.neuron.2014.04.036","first_seen_on":"2014-06-19T11:12:40+00:00","issns":["0896-6273","08966273"],"issue":"6","journal":"Neuron","last_mentioned_on":1442391459,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fneuron%2Fabstract%2FS0896-6273%252814%252900351-1&code=cell-site","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0896627314003511","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.neuron.2014.04.036","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/neuron\/abstract\/S0896-6273%2814%2900351-1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24945770"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S0896627314003511\/pdf","pmid":"24945770","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1255","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Off-Target Effect of doublecortin Family shRNA on Neuronal Migration Associated with Endogenous MicroRNA Dysregulation.","type":"article","volume":"82","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/offtarget-effect-doublecortin-family-shrna-neuronal-migration-associated-endogenous-microrna-dysregu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17.704,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17.704},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8059538,"mean":6.8397725663364,"rank":461079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7598453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8059538,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177884,"mean":7.429036051787,"rank":12650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":165233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177884,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4864,"mean":20.228019329632,"rank":1092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4864,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":25.376219178082,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":14,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":14,"Scientists":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":33,"Student  > Ph.
