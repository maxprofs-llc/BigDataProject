To date limited molecular studies were conducted to evaluate the frequency and type of such infections in semen Thus, we aimed at conceiving and validating a multiplex PCR (M-PCR) assay for the simultaneous detection of the following STD pathogens in semen: Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis, Herpes virus simplex (HSV) -1 and -2, and Treponema pallidum; We also investigated the potential usefulness of this M-PCR assay in screening programs for semen pathogens. In addition, we aimed: to detect human Papillomavirus (HPV) and genotypes by single PCR (sPCR) in the same semen samples; to determine the prevalence of the seven STDs, HPV and co-infections; to assess the possibility that these infections affect semen parameters and thus fertility. The overall validation parameters of M-PCR were extremely high including agreement (99.2%), sensitivity (100.00%), specificity (99.70%), positive (96.40%) and negative predictive values (100.00%) and accuracy (99.80%). The prevalence of STDs was very high (55.3%). Furthermore, associations were observed between STDs and changes in semen parameters, highlighting the importance of STD detection in semen. Thus, this M-PCR assay has great potential for application in semen screening programs for pathogens in infertility and STD clinics and in sperm banks.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Gimenes F","Medina FS","Abreu AL","Irie MM","Esqui\u00e7ati IB","Malagutti N","Vasconcellos VR","Discacciati MG","Bonini MG","Maria-Engler SS","Consolaro ME"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0098862","first_seen_on":"2014-06-18T05:38:06+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1404638595,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24921247?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0098862"],"pmid":"24921247","pubdate":"2014-06-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Sensitive Simultaneous Detection of Seven Sexually Transmitted Agents in Semen by Multiplex-PCR and of HPV by Single PCR","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sensitive-simultaneous-detection-seven-sexually-transmitted-agents-semen-multiplexpcr-hpv-single-pcr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2317496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2591858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124101,"mean":8.0629155036263,"rank":50800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":69472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124101,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88911,"mean":9.2651301540885,"rank":41547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":43816,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88911,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2705,"mean":13.369542899408,"rank":1412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2705,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
