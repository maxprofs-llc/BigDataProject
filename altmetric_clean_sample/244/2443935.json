Historically, it appears however that the first functional predictions about adaptive hippocampal specialization for spatial memory of stored food were preceded, not followed, by the mechanistic paradigm of massive modularity that was dominant in the 1990s. More attention is paid nowadays to domain general aspects of cognition and to neural connectivity. Attention is also now given to evo devo principles of brain organization, which suggest conserved routes to evolutionary changes in the brain driven by conserved developmental schedules. Knowledge gained in answering each of Tinbergen's four questions is thus useful in making predictions concerning the other ones.
