Irregular patterns of histone global acetylation and methylation have frequently been seen in various diseases. Quantitative analysis of these patterns is of high value for the evaluation of disease development and of outcomes from therapeutic treatment. Targeting histone acetylation and methylation by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) is one of the current quantitative methods. Here, we reported the use of the multiplexed parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) method on the QExactive mass spectrometer to target previously known lysine acetylation and methylation sites of histone H3 and H4 for the purpose of establishing precursor-product pairs for SRM. 55 modified peptides among which 29 were H3 K27\/K36 modified peptides were detected from 24 targeted precursor ions included in the inclusion list. The identification was carried out directly from the trypsin digests of core histones that were separated without derivatization on a homemade capillary column packed with Waters YMC ODS-AQ reversed phase materials. Besides documenting the higher-energy c-trap dissociation (HCD) MS(2) spectra of previously known histone H3\/H4 acetylated and methylated tryptic peptides, we identified novel H3 K18 methylation, H3 K27 monomethyl\/acetyl duel modifications, H2B K23 acetylation, and H4 K20 acetylation in mammalian histones. The information gained from these experiments sets the foundation for quantification of histone modifications by targeted mass spectrometry methods directly from core histone samples.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Hui Tang"],"doi":"10.1021\/ac500972x","first_seen_on":"2014-06-19T14:32:36+00:00","issns":["0003-2700"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1403190692,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ac500972x"],"pmid":"24823915","pubdate":"2014-05-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Multiplexed parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) targets histone modifications on the Q-Exactive mass spectrometer.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiplexed-parallel-reaction-monitoring-targeting-histone-modifications-qexactive-mass-spectrometer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2087760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2382118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107482,"mean":7.8228472753326,"rank":45701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":60696,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107482,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5069,"mean":2.4216104972376,"rank":1614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":3310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5069,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":388,"mean":3.4146046511628,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":300,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":388,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
