The proposed method utilizes a compound-eye sensor that is constructed by placing two binary sensors for the pedestrians' movement direction and multiple binary sensors for the vertical direction of the pedestrians' movement direction. A number of Monte Carlo simulations about the movement of pedestrians are conducted, and the output history of the compound-eye sensor is obtained in each simulation. The simulation scenario with a small difference of the output history of the compound-eye sensor is selected to estimate the number of pedestrians. Evaluation results show that in the field whose width is 8 [m] the relative error in the proposed method is the smallest by using 2\u00d78 binary sensors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8113cf058f61000bb46","doi":"10.1186\/2193-1801-3-299","first_seen_on":"2014-06-17T10:21:03+00:00","issns":["2193-1801"],"issue":"1","journal":"SpringerPlus","last_mentioned_on":1404464233,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerplus.com\/content\/3\/1\/299\/abstract","http:\/\/www.springerplus.com\/content\/pdf\/2193-1801-3-299.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.springerplus.com\/content\/pdf\/2193-1801-3-299.pdf","pmid":"24995154","pubdate":"2014-06-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","startpage":"299","title":"Pedestrian counting with grid-based binary sensors based on Monte Carlo method","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pedestrian-counting-gridbased-binary-sensors-based-monte-carlo-method"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3976406,"mean":5.0321946101045,"rank":1582011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2341484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3976406,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98780,"mean":7.585700355346,"rank":32340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":64930,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98780,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":796,"mean":2.4684830188679,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":796,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":4.526,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Computer Science":4}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"JP":1,"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TaniguchiLab\/status\/478844432649691136","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2442508],"posted_on":"2014-06-17T10:19:43+00:00","author":{"name":"\u8fd1\u757f\u5927\u5b66\u77e5\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7db2\u7814\u7a76\u5ba4","url":"http:\/\/www.icnl.jp\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/483497298530299904\/foD8TpN6_normal.png","description":"\u8fd1\u757f\u5927\u5b66\u7406\u5de5\u5b66\u90e8\u60c5\u5831\u5b66\u79d1\u77e5\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7db2\u7814\u7a76\u5ba4\uff08\u8c37\u53e3\u7814\u7a76\u5ba4\uff09\u306e\u5927\u5b66\u5185\u5916\u3078\u306e\u5e83\u5831\u7528\u30a2\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u3059\u3002\u8c37\u53e3\u7814\u304a\u3088\u3073\u8c37\u53e3\u8b1b\u5e2b\u306e\u8fd1\u6cc1\u3092\u5831\u544a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3088\u308d\u3057\u304f\u304a\u9858\u3044\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002","id_on_source":"TaniguchiLab","tweeter_id":"2444934590","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":57},"tweet_id":"478844432649691136"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaniguchiLab\/status\/484984263398264832","license":"datasift","rt":["SpringerPlus"],"citation_ids":[2442508],"posted_on":"2014-07-04T08:57:13+00:00","author":{"name":"\u8fd1\u757f\u5927\u5b66\u77e5\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7db2\u7814\u7a76\u5ba4","url":"http:\/\/www.icnl.jp\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/483497298530299904\/foD8TpN6_normal.png","description":"\u8fd1\u757f\u5927\u5b66\u7406\u5de5\u5b66\u90e8\u60c5\u5831\u5b66\u79d1\u77e5\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7db2\u7814\u7a76\u5ba4\uff08\u8c37\u53e3\u7814\u7a76\u5ba4\uff09\u306e\u5927\u5b66\u5185\u5916\u3078\u306e\u5e83\u5831\u7528\u30a2\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u3059\u3002\u8c37\u53e3\u7814\u304a\u3088\u3073\u8c37\u53e3\u8b1b\u5e2b\u306e\u8fd1\u6cc1\u3092\u5831\u544a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3088\u308d\u3057\u304f\u304a\u9858\u3044\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002","id_on_source":"TaniguchiLab","tweeter_id":"2444934590","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":57},"tweet_id":"484984263398264832"}],"googleplus":[{"title":"Pedestrian counting with grid-based binary #sensors based on Monte Carlo method http:\/\/ow.ly\/yDQWI ...","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/108618215708546149812\/posts\/eQC4zGNcALh","license":"public","citation_ids":[2442508],"posted_on":"2014-07-01T17:02:01+00:00","summary":"Pedestrian counting with grid-based binary #sensors based on Monte Carlo method http:\/\/ow.ly\/yDQWI ...
