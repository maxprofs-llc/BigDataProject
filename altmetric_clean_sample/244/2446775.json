Two-hundred and ten substance-abuse treatment providers completed a survey measuring attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, intentions, and behavior. Results indicate that substance-abuse treatment providers have very positive attitudes, neutral subjective norms, somewhat positive perceived behavioral control, somewhat positive intentions toward recommending MAT as part of their clients' treatment plan, and were somewhat likely to engage in the actual behavior. Further, the data fit both the TRA and TPB, but with the TPB model having better fit and predictive power for this target audience and behavior. The theoretical and practical implications for the developing messages for substance-abuse treatment providers and other health-care professionals who provide treatment to patients with substance use disorders are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f45","doi":"10.1016\/j.jsat.2014.06.002","first_seen_on":"2014-06-18T16:38:12+00:00","issns":["07405472","0740-5472"],"journal":"Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1416753917,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0740547214000956","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0740547214000956&_version=1&md5=060942c0020822ef064fba567b7061b7","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.journalofsubstanceabusetreatment.com%2Farticle%2FS0740-5472%252814%252900095-6%2Fabstract&code=sat-site"],"pmid":"25092045","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Predicting substance-abuse treatment providers' communication with clients about medication assisted treatment: A test of the theories of reasoned action and planned behavior","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predicting-substanceabuse-treatment-providers-communication-clients-about-medication-assisted-treatm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4540307,"mean":5.2995083963578,"rank":2180074,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2231540,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4540307,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107888,"mean":7.97820117345,"rank":47852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":55970,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107888,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":559,"mean":2.8698243727599,"rank":232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":559,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":10.211111111111,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
