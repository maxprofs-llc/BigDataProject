Ineffective state regulation, however, has meant little control over the clinical activities of private sector providers while the price of medical services has, in recent years, grown faster than the average rate of inflation. Reforms that are targeted at reorganizing the private sector, with a view to enhancing efficiency in the supply of services, are urgently required if costs are to be contained and consumers assured of good value for money.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5933cf058f610004f68","authors":["Ibukun Ogunbekun","Adenike Ogunbekun","Nosa Orobaton"],"first_seen_on":"2014-06-16T15:36:14+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1460-2237","0268-1080"],"issue":"2","journal":"Health Policy & Planning","last_mentioned_on":1402932928,"links":["http:\/\/heapol.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/14\/2\/174.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/heapol.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/14\/2\/174.full.pdf","pmid":"10538720","pubdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Policy And Administration","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","publichealth"],"title":"Private Health Care in Nigeria: Walking the Tightrope","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/private-health-care-nigeria-walking-tightrope-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":3111471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1004038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103454,"mean":7.8398984273052,"rank":70975,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":24718,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103454,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":683,"mean":4.853275659824,"rank":604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":683,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":8.895,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
