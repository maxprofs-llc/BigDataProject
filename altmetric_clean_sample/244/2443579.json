However, to uniformly grow NWs in a 3D confined space is a serious challenge due to the coupling between crystal growth and precursor concentration that is often dictated by the mass flow characteristic of vapor or liquid phase reactants within the high-aspect ratio submicrometer channels in current strategies. We report a pulsed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process that successfully addressed this issue and grew TiO(2) nanorods uniformly covering the entire inner surface of highly confined nanochannels. We propose a mechanism for the anisotropic growth of anatase TiO(2) based on the surface-reaction-limited CVD process. This strategy would lead to the realization of NW-based 3D nanoarchitectures from various functional materials for the applications of sensors, solar cells, catalysts, energy storage systems, and so forth.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011NanoL..11..624S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Jian Shi"],"doi":"10.1021\/nl103702j","first_seen_on":"2014-06-17T16:30:42+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Nano Letters","last_mentioned_on":1403037360,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/nl103702j"],"pmid":"21261290","pubdate":"2011-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Growth of Titanium Dioxide Nanorods in 3D-Confined Spaces","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/growth-titanium-dioxide-nanorods-3dconfined-spaces"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5380847,"mean":6.2871912171441,"rank":2857346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1828906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5380847,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129807,"mean":8.1559192641327,"rank":64559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":49588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129807,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3419,"mean":11.286942071387,"rank":2199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3419,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135,"mean":16.660074626866,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
