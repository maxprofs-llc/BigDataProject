Trapped molecules can enter the pore multiple times before escaping the trap by passing through the pore or by diffusing away. Statistical analysis of many individually trapped molecules yields a detailed picture of the fluctuation phenomena involved, which are successfully modeled by a one-dimensional first passage approach.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["David P.
