Patients with urodynamically proven stress incontinence (SI) underwent a concomitant tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) procedure.\nPatients underwent LSC with a polypropylene implant.\nPrincipal outcome measures were anatomic cure (stage 1 or lower) assessed by the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POPQ) system and subjective cure and impact on quality of life measured by a standardised interview and, since its introduction in 2004, by a prolapse-specific quality-of-life questionnaire (P-QOL).\nAt a mean follow-up of 12.5 mo, the anatomic cure rate for the apex was 98%. Anatomic failures elsewhere were mainly at the posterior compartment (18%). Subjective prolapse cure rate was 91.7%, and no patients required reoperation for recurrent prolapse. Symptoms of preoperative SI, urge incontinence, or constipation were cured in 43%, 46%, and 42% of patients, respectively. The rate of de novo SI was 7.3%. De novo constipation developed in 5% and de novo dyspareunia developed in 19%. Patients' quality of life improved significantly. Erosions occurred in 4.5%, all within 1 yr. A limitation of the study is that the quality-of-life assessment score became available halfway through the study, limiting the number of preoperative observations (n=36).\nWe demonstrated that LSC results in good anatomic outcome and subjective cure of prolapse symptoms at medium term. The posterior compartment was most vulnerable for recurrence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002875","authors":["Filip Claerhout","Dirk De Ridder","Jan Paul Roovers","Heidi Rommens","Federico Spelzini","Vanessa Vandenbroucke","Georges Coremans","Jan Deprest"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.eururo.2008.12.008","first_seen_on":"2017-07-10T12:36:11+00:00","issns":["03022838"],"issue":"6","journal":"European Urology","last_mentioned_on":1498567625,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.eururo.2008.12.008"],"pmid":"19111382","pubdate":"2009-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Medium-Term Anatomic and Functional Results of Laparoscopic Sacrocolpopexy Beyond the Learning Curve","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mediumterm-anatomic-functional-results-laparoscopic-sacrocolpopexy-beyond-learning-curve"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":2166192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5114122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232671,"mean":12.894861632355,"rank":78054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":152430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232671,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2889,"mean":10.777879501385,"rank":1524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":1182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2889,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":26.636470588235,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
