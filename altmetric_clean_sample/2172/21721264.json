Multiple clinical and surgical variables were evaluated for potential association with treatment failure, which was defined as any repeat operation for recurrent prolapse or mesh-related complications.\nThe median age at surgery was 67\u00a0years (interquartile range 59-74\u00a0years) and median follow up was 72\u00a0months (interquartile range 39-114\u00a0months). Overall, six out of 70 patients (8.6%) underwent a total of six secondary surgeries, including four for recurrent prolapse (two anterior repairs, one posterior repair, one apical) and two mesh complications. No patient-related factors were associated with the risk of repeat surgery: age (P\u00a0=\u00a00.45), diabetes mellitus (P\u00a0=\u00a00.24), tobacco use (P\u00a0=\u00a00.61) or prior prolapse surgery (P\u00a0=\u00a00.1) on univariate analysis. Freedom from repeat prolapse surgery or surgery for mesh complication was 98% at 1\u00a0year, 95% at 3\u00a0years and 90% at 6\u00a0years. At last follow up, 80% of patients reported that they would or probably would recommend robotic sacrocolpopexy to a family member or friend.\nRobotic sacrocolpopexy is associated with excellent long-term outcomes. Recognition of long-term success is important for preoperative patient counseling.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002bb8","authors":["Linder, Brian J","Chow, George K","Elliott, Daniel S"],"doi":"10.1111\/iju.12900","endpage":"1158","first_seen_on":"2017-07-10T12:36:35+00:00","issns":["09198172","1442-2042"],"issue":"12","journal":"International Journal of Urology","last_mentioned_on":1498567625,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/iju.12900"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/iju.12900\/pdf","pmid":"26300382","pubdate":"2015-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1155","title":"Long-term quality of life outcomes and retreatment rates after robotic sacrocolpopexy","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-quality-life-outcomes-retreatment-rates-after-robotic-sacrocolpopexy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":2166192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5114122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232671,"mean":12.894861632355,"rank":78054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":152430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232671,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":484,"mean":3.9404637681159,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":484,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.8533333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
