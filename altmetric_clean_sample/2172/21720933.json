Interactive docking of omeprazole in both CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 gives rise to binding orientations which are consistent with both the known sites of metabolism reported for these isoforms and with evidence from site-directed mutagenesis experiments on CYP2C19, a P450 associated with genetic polymorphism in human drug metabolism. The potential P450 enzymic interactions, inhibition and induction of omeprazole are discussed in the light of molecular modelling and QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) studies on related compounds.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003679","authors":["David F.V.
