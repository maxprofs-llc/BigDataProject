In addition, preliminary accounts from some participants suggested that parents may experience tensions between desires to reduce drinking for child-related reasons and complex factors maintaining their drinking behaviour, including the use of alcohol to cope with stressors and trauma.\nThis study provides novel insights into the consequences and motivations of parental drinking in a high-risk context. Contextual risks (e.g., poverty and violence) that exacerbate the impact of parental drinking on children may be the same factors that continue to shape intergenerational alcohol use in this community. Findings highlight opportunities for further research and interventions to support child protection in South Africa.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f61000150a","authors":["Karmel W.
