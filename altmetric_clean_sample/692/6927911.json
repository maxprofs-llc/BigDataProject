We included 119 practices in 18 primary care clinics across urban and rural Manitoba. The main outcome measure was EMR problem list completeness. Completeness was measured by comparing the number of EMR-documented diagnoses to the number of billings associated with each disease. We calculated odds ratios for the effect of clinic patient load and salary type on EMR problem list completeness of the 7 chronic diseases.\nCompleteness of EMR problem list for each disease varied widely among clinics. Factors that significantly affected EMR problem list completeness included the primary care provider, the patient load, and the clinic's funding and organization model (ie, salaried, fee-for-service, or residency training clinics). Average rates of completeness were: hypertension, 72%; diabetes, 80%; hypothyroidism, 63%; asthma, 56%; chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, 43%; congestive heart failure, 54%; and coronary artery disease, 64%.\nThis study demonstrates the high variability but generally low quality of problem lists (health condition records) related to 7 common chronic diseases in EMRs. There are systematic physician- and clinic-level factors associated with low data quality completeness. This information may be useful to support improvement in EMR data quality in primary care.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5743cf058f610004cca","authors":["Alexander Singer","Sari Yakubovich","Andrea L Kroeker","Brenden Dufault","Roberto Duarte","Alan Katz","Singer, Alexander","Yakubovich, Sari","Kroeker, Andrea L","Dufault, Brenden","Duarte, Roberto","Katz, Alan"],"doi":"10.1093\/jamia\/ocw013","endpage":"1112","first_seen_on":"2016-04-24T03:07:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1527-974X","1067-5027"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association","last_mentioned_on":1480648019,"links":["http:\/\/jamia.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/22\/jamia.ocw013.large.jpg?rss=1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27107454?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27107454","http:\/\/jamia.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/22\/jamia.ocw013","http:\/\/jamia.oxfordjournals.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/ocw013v1?rss=1","http:\/\/jamia.oxfordjournals.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/23\/6\/1107?rss=1&utm_content=bufferf072e&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/jamia.oxfordjournals.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/23\/6\/1107?rss=1","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27107454"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jamia.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/jaminfo\/early\/2016\/04\/22\/jamia.ocw013.full.pdf","pmid":"27107454","pubdate":"2016-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1107","subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Data quality of electronic medical records in Manitoba: do problem lists accurately reflect chronic disease billing diagnoses?","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/data-quality-electronic-medical-records-manitoba-problem-lists-accurately-reflect-chronic-disease-bi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.4,"score_history":{"1y":2.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7836572,"mean":6.6415682037409,"rank":1049206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":6785111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7836572,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268496,"mean":11.382738144099,"rank":52458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":215900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268496,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1630,"mean":9.7545942295887,"rank":451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":1177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1630,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":24.116886075949,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
