Both patients had complete resolution of palinopsia when topiramate was discontinued. A third patient is described who developed the \"Alice in Wonderland\" syndrome about 1 week after starting topiramate for migraine prevention with complete resolution of symptoms about 1 month after stopping. Topiramate use may cause palinopsia and may be associated with the Alice in Wonderland syndrome through an unknown mechanism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029b5","authors":["Evans RW","Randolph W.
