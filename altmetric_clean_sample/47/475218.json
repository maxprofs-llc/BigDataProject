The polymer molecules treated in this study are assumed to be composed of beads and bonds, and they are put in a three-dimensional face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice. The values of Flory's critical exponent, \u03bd, for linear and ring polymers were estimated from the N dependence of R(g), and the temperatures at which \u03bd reach 1\/2 were obtained. Here we define those as \u0398-temperatures in this report. The simulation result shows that the \u0398-temperature for ring polymers is evidently lower than that of the linear polymers, and the origin of the \u0398-temperature depression is discussed. Since R(g) of a ring polymer is smaller than that for a linear polymer at the same N and temperature, the segment density for a ring polymer is increased by the topological effect and the repulsive force between segments of a ring polymer at the \u0398-temperature for a linear polymer is stronger. Thus, the origin of the \u0398-temperature depression for ring polymers is the repulsive force emphasized by the topological effect of rings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011JChPh.135t4903S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cee","authors":["Matsushita, Yushu"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.3663383","first_seen_on":"2011-12-01T03:02:22+00:00","issns":["00219606"],"journal":"Journal of Chemical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1322707517,"links":["http:\/\/jcp.aip.org\/resource\/1\/jcpsa6\/v135\/i20\/p204903_s1?isAuthorized=no"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.aip.org\/link\/?JCPSA6\/135\/204903\/1\/pdf","pmid":"22128955","pubdate":"2011-12-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Institute of Physics","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"The theta-temperature depression caused by topological effect in ring polymers studied by Monte Carlo simulation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thetatemperature-depression-caused-topological-effect-ring-polymers-studied-monte-carlo-simulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":3094739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":969304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230833,"mean":4.2079343765165,"rank":144384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":49843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230833,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3787,"mean":2.0383470681458,"rank":1818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":1486,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3787,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":326,"mean":1.3757169230769,"rank":121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":326,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Ph.
