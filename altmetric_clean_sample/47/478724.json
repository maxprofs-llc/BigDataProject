A novel open reading frame-trapping method was used to isolate uninterrupted transposase coding regions from the genome of the frog species Rana pipiens. The isolated clones were approximately 90% identical to a predicted transposase gene sequence from Xenopus laevis, but contained an unpredicted, approximately 180 bp region encoding the N-terminus of the putative transposase. None of these native genes was found to be active. Therefore, a consensus sequence of the transposase gene was derived. This engineered transposase and the transposon inverted repeats together constitute the components of a novel transposon system that we named Frog Prince (FP). FP has only approximately 50% sequence similarity to Sleeping Beauty (SB), and catalyzes efficient cut-and-paste transposition in fish, amphibian and mammalian cell lines. We demonstrate high-efficiency gene trapping in human cells using FP transposition. FP is the most efficient DNA-based transposon from vertebrates described to date, and shows approximately 70% higher activity in zebrafish cells than SB. Frog Prince can greatly extend our possibilities for genetic analyses in vertebrates.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","doi":"10.1093\/nar\/gkg910","first_seen_on":"2011-12-03T19:38:09+00:00","issns":["1362-4962"],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","last_mentioned_on":1322940202,"links":["http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/31\/23\/6873.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/31\/23\/6873.full.pdf","pmid":"14627820","pubdate":"2003-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The Frog Prince: a reconstructed transposon from Rana pipiens with high transpositional activity in vertebrate cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/frog-prince-reconstructed-transposon-rana-pipiens-high-transpositional-activity-vertebrate-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":2015834,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227224,"mean":3.9087797538104,"rank":97793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":89650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227224,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7704,"mean":3.0680999610541,"rank":4935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7704,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":724,"mean":3.0209017980636,"rank":342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":724,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
