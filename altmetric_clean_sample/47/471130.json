Thus, these carotenoids (alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, beta-cryptoxanthin, fucoxanthin, astaxanthin, capsanthin, crocetin and phytoene), as well as beta-carotene, may be useful for cancer prevention. In the case of phytoene, the concept of 'bio-chemoprevention', which means biotechnology-assisted method for cancerchemoprevention, may be applicable. In fact, establishment of mammalian cells producing phytoene was succeeded by the introduction of crtB gene, which encodes phytoene synthase, and these cells were proven to acquire the resistance against carcinogenesis. Antioxidative phytoene-containing animal foods may be classified as a novel type of functional food, which has the preventive activity against carcinogenesis, as well as the ability to reduce the accumulation of oxidative damages, which are hazardous for human health.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000dfa","authors":["Nishino, Hoyoku","Murakosh, Michiaki","Ii, Tsunehiro","Takemura, Manabu","Kuchide, Masashi","Kanazawa, Motohiro","Mou, Xiao Yang","Wada, Saeri","Masuda, Mitsuharu","Ohsaka, Yasuhito","Yogosawa, Shingo","Satomi, Yoshiko","Jinno, Kenji"],"first_seen_on":"2011-11-27T19:30:57+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0167-7659"],"issue":"3-4","journal":"Cancer and Metastasis Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1322422096,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12549764"],"pmid":"12549764","pubdate":"2002-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Molecular Diversity Preservation International","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Carotenoids in cancer chemoprevention.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carotenoids-cancer-chemoprevention"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":2015836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226630,"mean":3.8945114614637,"rank":97397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":89648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226630,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166,"mean":2.4490424242424,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":4.725,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
