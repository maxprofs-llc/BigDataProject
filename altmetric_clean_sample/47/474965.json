Endometrial cancer is staged according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics surgical system. Clinical estimation of stage, however, can be inaccurate in more than 20%, and therefore, preoperative imaging of the disease may assist in planning the optimal course of treatment. For example, cross-sectional imaging, especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may detect gross myometrial extension or extension of tumor to the cervical stroma, which can alter management and therefore help in preoperative surgical planning. This issue is increasingly relevant as less invasive surgical techniques, such as laparoscopic surgeries, are becoming more commonplace for lower stage cancers. Several imaging techniques such as MRI, computed tomography, and transvaginal ultrasound have been used as tools for preoperative staging of endometrial cancer. Currently, MRI is the most widely used modality for preoperative planning. This article discusses the use of MRI in diagnosis, staging, and detection of endometrial cancer and treatment of recurrent disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c0f","authors":["Silanath Peungjesada","Priya R.
