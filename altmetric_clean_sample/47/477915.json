XCXCLC overexpression resulted in the attraction of nearby mesodermal cells, and the excess of chemoattractant interfered with convergent and extension movements. The direction of the deep neural plate cells around the notoplate was also controlled by XCXCLC. Fluorescence signals for XCXCLC\u2003+\u2003enhanced green fluorescent protein derivatives accumulated around the notochord region. These results indicate that XCXCLC attracts adjacent cells to the midline region, so as to ensure accurate lateral-medial directional tissue convergence during gastrulation and neurulation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026ec","doi":"10.1111\/j.1440-169x.2011.01304.x","first_seen_on":"2011-12-02T22:54:22+00:00","issns":["1440-169X"],"journal":"Development, Growth & Differentiation","last_mentioned_on":1322866174,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22103472"],"pmid":"22103472","pubdate":"2011-11-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["embryology","biology"],"title":"Chemokine ligand Xenopus CXCLC (XCXCLC) regulates cell movements during early morphogenesis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemokine-ligand-xenopus-cxclc-xcxclc-regulates-cell-movements-during-early-morphogenesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":2669626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1696335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234009,"mean":4.4822577091385,"rank":102105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":98124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234009,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":221,"mean":2.2052363636364,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":89,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":221,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.85714285714286,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
