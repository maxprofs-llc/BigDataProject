We investigated IL-4 knockout (ko) mice to characterize their pain behavior before and after chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve as a model for neuropathic pain. We investigated opioid responsivity and measured cytokine and opioid receptor gene expression in the peripheral and central nervous system (PNS, CNS) of IL-4 ko mice in comparison with wildtype (wt) mice. Na\u00efve IL-4 ko mice displayed tactile allodynia (wt: 0.45 g; ko: 0.18 g; p<0.001), while responses to heat and cold stimuli and to muscle pressure were not different. No compensatory changes in the gene expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, and IL-13 were found in the PNS and CNS of na\u00efve IL-4 ko mice. However, IL-1\u03b2 gene expression was stronger in the sciatic nerve of IL-4 ko mice (p<0.001) 28 days after CCI and only IL-4 ko mice had elevated IL-10 gene expression (p\u200a=\u200a0.014). Remarkably, CCI induced TNF (p<0.01), IL-1\u03b2 (p<0.05), IL-10 (p<0.05), and IL-13 (p<0.001) gene expression exclusively in the ipsilateral spinal cord of IL-4 ko mice. The compensatory overexpression of the anti-inflammatory and analgesic cytokines IL-10 and IL-13 in the spinal cord of IL-4 ko mice may explain the lack of genotype differences for pain behavior after CCI. Additionally, CCI induced gene expression of \u03bc, \u03ba, and \u03b4 opioid receptors in the contralateral cortex and thalamus of IL-4 ko mice, paralleled by fast onset of morphine analgesia, but not in wt mice. We conclude that a lack of IL-4 leads to mechanical sensitivity; the compensatory hyperexpression of analgesic cytokines and opioid receptors after CCI, in turn, protects IL-4 ko mice from enhanced pain behavior after nerve lesion.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Nurcan \u00dc\u00e7eyler","Teng\u00fc Topuzo\u011flu","Peter Schie\u00dfer","Saskia Hahnenkamp","Claudia Sommer"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0028205","first_seen_on":"2011-12-04T12:36:55+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1323001724,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0028205"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0028205.pdf","pmid":"22164245","pubdate":"2011-12-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e28205","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"IL-4 Deficiency Is Associated with Mechanical Hypersensitivity in Mice","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/il4-deficiency-associated-mechanical-hypersensitivity-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":983872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230853,"mean":4.1800472250622,"rank":144874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":52644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230853,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80034,"mean":8.2711350817788,"rank":55562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":17301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80034,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3604,"mean":5.9038284762698,"rank":2262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3604,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
