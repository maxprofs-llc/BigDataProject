Hydrogenation dramatically increases the quantum yield, suggesting that hydrogen-terminated sites work as electron reservoirs. NDs can also be used as effective photocatalysts to reduce graphene oxide. The resulting composites exhibit high and stable photocurrent generation upon visible light irradiation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e2","doi":"10.1039\/c1cc16210a","first_seen_on":"2011-12-04T16:55:37+00:00","issns":["1364-548X"],"journal":"Chemical Communications","last_mentioned_on":1323017058,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22134188?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22134188","pubdate":"2011-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Nanodiamonds as photocatalysts for reduction of water and graphene oxide.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nanodiamonds-photocatalysts-reduction-water-graphene-oxide"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":3107918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":993452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230853,"mean":4.1734048741187,"rank":144664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":55238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230853,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3887,"mean":2.5944817292846,"rank":2285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3887,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":439,"mean":2.9281780821918,"rank":317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":439,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
