To decrease viral vector antigenic immunodominance and MHC class-I driven clearance, we engineered recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVV) expressing ICP47 alone (rVV-US12) or together with endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted Melan-A\/MART-1(27-35) model tumor epitope (rVV-MUS12). In this study, we show that antigen presenting cells (APC), infected with rVV-US12, display a decreased ability to present TAP dependent MHC class-I restricted viral antigens to CD8+ T-cells. While HLA class-I cell surface expression is strongly downregulated, other important immune related molecules such as CD80, CD44 and, most importantly, MHC class-II are unaffected. Characterization of rVV-MUS12 infected cells demonstrates that over-expression of a TAP-independent peptide, partially compensates for ICP47 induced surface MHC class-I downregulation (30% vs. 70% respectively). Most importantly, in conditions where clearance of infected APC by virus-specific CTL represents a limiting factor, a significant enhancement of CTL responses to the tumor epitope can be detected in cultures stimulated with rVV-MUS12, as compared to those stimulated by rVV-MART alone. Such reagents could become of high relevance in multiple boost protocols required for cancer immunotherapy, to limit vector-specific responsiveness.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f610007841","doi":"10.1002\/ijc.27362","first_seen_on":"2011-11-26T19:51:23+00:00","issns":["1097-0215"],"journal":"International Journal of Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1364772314,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22116674?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22116674","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/ijc.27362"],"pmid":"22116674","pubdate":"2011-11-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Preventing vaccinia virus class\u2010I epitopes presentation by HSV\u2010ICP47 enhances the immunogenicity of a TAP\u2010independent cancer vaccine epitope","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preventing-vaccinia-virus-classi-epitopes-presentation-hsvicp47-enhances-immunogenicity-tapindepende"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4504771,"mean":5.0225959121568,"rank":911539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3579038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4504771,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229740,"mean":4.0196832579581,"rank":43431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":185395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229740,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2846,"mean":3.7831114235501,"rank":463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":2373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2846,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203,"mean":2.8007524752475,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
