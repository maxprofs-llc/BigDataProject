Here we use a historical approach to test the hypothesis of codivergence in three clades of the Chilean freshwater species assemblage. Molecular studies of freshwater crabs (Aegla: Aeglidae: Anomura) and catfish (Trichomycterus arealatus: Trichomycteridae: Teleostei) exhibited similar levels of genetic divergences of mitochondrial lineages between species of crabs and phylogroups of the catfish, suggesting a shared evolutionary history among the three clades in this species assemblage.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b5","authors":["Brian R Barber","Peter J Unmack","Marcos P\u00e9rez-Losada","Jerald B Johnson","Keith A Crandall","Barber BR","Unmack PJ","P\u00e9rez-Losada M","Johnson JB","Crandall KA"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2148-11-343","first_seen_on":"2011-11-26T21:43:56+00:00","issns":["","1471-2148"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Evolutionary Biology","last_mentioned_on":1322343098,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/11\/343"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2148-11-343.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3238299","pmid":"22118288","pubdate":"2011-11-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"343","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Different processes lead to similar patterns: a test of codivergence and the role of sea level and climate changes in shaping a southern temperate freshwater assemblage","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/different-processes-lead-similar-patterns-test-codivergence-role-sea-level-climate-changes-shaping-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":983713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229750,"mean":4.1621268688876,"rank":144024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":52426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229750,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1431,"mean":7.2423090909091,"rank":1152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1431,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":6.2989473684211,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
