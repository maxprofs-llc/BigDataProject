Lack of AD pathology in patients with Al encephalopathy indicates Al does not cause AD. On the other hand, some epidemiological studies have suggested high Al increases the occurrence of AD. Our purpose is to test if high Al in drinking water is a risk factor for AD. We administered Al and Zn in drinking water to Tg2576, a transgenic mouse model for amyloid \u03b2-protein (A\u03b2) deposition with the A\u03b2 precursor protein (A\u03b2PP) mutations (K670N\/M671L), and Tg2576\/tau(P301L), a model for A\u03b2 and tau deposition. Deionized water was given to the control Tg2576 and Tg2576\/tau. After administration for 4-10 months of approximately 100\u2003mg\/kg body weight Al or Zn per day, we were not able to find by quantitative immunohistochemical analyses differences in the deposition of A\u03b2 and tau between the treated and untreated groups. Nor did the Al or Zn treatment affect the amount of soluble A\u03b2 and A\u03b2*56, an A\u03b2 oligomer, measured by ELISA or immunoblot. The oral intake of excess Al or Zn does not accelerate AD pathology in the transgenic mouse models for A\u03b2 and tau accumulation. Such results do not seem to support the notion that excessive oral intake of Al or Zn is a risk factor for AD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319d","doi":"10.1111\/j.1440-1789.2011.01274.x","first_seen_on":"2011-11-30T18:21:34+00:00","issns":["1440-1789"],"journal":"Neuropathology","last_mentioned_on":1330443468,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22118300?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/22118300\/?i=3&from=alzheimer's","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22118300"],"pmid":"22118300","pubdate":"2011-11-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology","neurology"],"title":"Long-term oral intake of aluminium or zinc does not accelerate Alzheimer pathology in A\u03b2PP and A\u03b2PP\/tau transgenic mice.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-oral-intake-aluminium-zinc-not-accelerate-alzheimer-pathology-a%CE%B2pp-a%CE%B2pptau-transgenic-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":702984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":4333337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233511,"mean":4.4804750460368,"rank":30260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":203175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233511,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273,"mean":1.9979191176471,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":0.38666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":5,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":2,"US":5,"CA":1},"mendeley":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/3vc\/status\/141941328685694977","citation_ids":[474643],"posted_on":"2011-11-30T18:07:04+00:00","author":{"name":"9\u03c1\u044d","url":"http:\/\/youtu.be\/iyh4Vo0qgAg","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/737551469050630144\/3QmS_br3_normal.jpg","description":"\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8\u59cb\u3081\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002","id_on_source":"3vc","tweeter_id":"29976031","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":352},"tweet_id":"141941328685694977"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/gaijinhero\/status\/174273580333416448","rt":["terrinakamura","EmilieTD"],"citation_ids":[474643],"posted_on":"2012-02-27T23:23:54+00:00","author":{"name":"Frank Simon","url":"http:\/\/gaijinhero.com","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1590565391\/IMG_1077_normal.JPG","description":"This is the official account for http:\/\/GaijinHero.com run by @silverstar22b We tweet about iPhone, Apple, cool stuff and photography.","id_on_source":"gaijinhero","tweeter_id":"291460259","geo":{"lt":"35.6800712","ln":"139.7685224","country":"JP"},"followers":583},"tweet_id":"174273580333416448"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/puzzlemare\/status\/174378225181540352","rt":["terrinakamura","EmilieTD"],"citation_ids":[474643],"posted_on":"2012-02-28T06:19:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Mary Albitz","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/JigsawJava","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/111209757\/Mary-picture_normal.jpg","description":"Mary Albitz uses her love of jigsaw puzzles to bring relief to the puzzle-challenged.
