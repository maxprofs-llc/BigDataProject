All the twenty nine compounds were evaluated for anticancer activity against five human cancer cell lines (A-549, A375, MCF-7, HT-29 and ACHN). Some of the synthesized compounds showed good anticancer activity that is comparable to etoposide. The IC(50) of compounds 17a and 17f is 2.7 and 2.1\u00a0\u03bcM respectively against A-549 cancer cell line. Flow cytometric analysis showed that these two compounds arrested the cell cycle in the G2\/M phase leading to caspase-3 dependent apoptotic cell death. Further, Hoechst 33258 staining and DNA fragmentation assay also suggested that 17a and 17f induced cell death by apoptosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000283d","doi":"10.1016\/j.ejmech.2011.11.024","first_seen_on":"2011-11-29T02:00:51+00:00","issns":["02235234"],"journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1322531664,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSCONTENT&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0223523411008464&_version=1&md5=19430196a1b8a7702c67ae38489ae7e2&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"22136907","pubdate":"2011-11-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis and anticancer activity of 4\u03b2-alkylamidochalcone and 4\u03b2-cinnamido linked podophyllotoxins as apoptotic inducing agents","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-anticancer-activity-4%CE%B2alkylamidochalcone-4%CE%B2cinnamido-linked-podophyllotoxins-apoptotic-ind"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626769,"mean":4.9522514062143,"rank":2907377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":72993,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626769,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226922,"mean":3.939609106253,"rank":163653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226922,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":431,"mean":1.1129720930233,"rank":223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":431,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.3479285714286,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
