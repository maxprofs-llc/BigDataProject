Internal tendon dynamics during passive ankle joint motion have direct implications for clinical rehabilitation protocols after Achilles tendon surgery. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that tendon tissue displacement is different in different layers of the Achilles tendon during controlled passive ankle joint movements.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fc1","doi":"10.1007\/s00167-011-1801-9","first_seen_on":"2011-11-29T12:15:30+00:00","issns":["1433-7347"],"journal":"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy","last_mentioned_on":1322568747,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22120840?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22120840","pubdate":"2011-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","sportsmedicine"],"title":"Non-uniform displacement within the Achilles tendon during passive ankle joint motion.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonuniform-displacement-within-achilles-tendon-during-passive-ankle-joint-motion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":3557132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":830971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233379,"mean":4.4781176374811,"rank":146437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":42122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233379,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":908,"mean":3.6610826901874,"rank":618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":908,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":1.1909090909091,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
