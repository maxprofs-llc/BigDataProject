To examine whether these injury-induced changes in SCs are also regulated posttranscriptionally by miRNAs, we performed miRNA expression profiling of mouse sciatic nerve distal segment after crush injury. We also characterized the SC injury response in mice containing SCs with disrupted miRNA processing due to loss of Dicer. We identified 87 miRNAs that were expressed in mouse adult peripheral nerve, 48 of which were dynamically regulated after nerve injury. Most of these injury-regulated SC miRNAs were computationally predicted to inhibit drivers of SC dedifferentiation\/proliferation and thereby re-enforce the transcriptional program driving SC remyelination. SCs deficient in miRNAs manifested a delay in the transition between the distinct differentiation states required to support peripheral nerve regeneration. Among the miRNAs expressed in adult mouse SCs, miR-34a and miR-140 were identified as functional regulators of SC dedifferentiation\/proliferation and remyelination, respectively. We found that miR-34a interacted with positive regulators of dedifferentiation and proliferation such as Notch1 and Ccnd1 to control cell cycle dynamics in SCs. miR-140 targeted the transcription factor Egr2, a master regulator of myelination, and modulated myelination in DRG\/SC cocultures. Together, these results demonstrate that SC miRNAs are important modulators of the SC regenerative response after nerve damage.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Andreu Viader","Li-Wei Chang","Timothy Fahrner","Rakesh Nagarajan","Jeffrey Milbrandt","Viader A","Chang LW","Fahrner T","Nagarajan R","Milbrandt J"],"doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.3931-11.2011","endpage":"17369","first_seen_on":"2011-12-01T01:20:34+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1529-2401","0270-6474"],"issue":"48","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1323388800,"links":["http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/31\/48\/17358.short?rss=1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pulsenews","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22131398"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/31\/48\/17358.full.pdf","pmid":"22131398","pubdate":"2011-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society for Neuroscience","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"17358","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"MicroRNAs Modulate Schwann Cell Response to Nerve Injury by Reinforcing Transcriptional Silencing of Dedifferentiation-Related Genes","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/micrornas-modulate-schwann-cell-response-nerve-injury-reinforcing-transcriptional-silencing-dediffer-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630432,"mean":4.9299514944696,"rank":1529678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2001856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630432,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227292,"mean":3.9029013203341,"rank":62591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":159587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227292,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9098,"mean":6.115915356711,"rank":3992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4947,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9098,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274,"mean":3.6721611721612,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":179,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
