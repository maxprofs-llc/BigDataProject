A growing number of reports, which are summarized in this review, mirror the viability of pulmonary gene delivery. Special attention has been paid to the biological barriers in the lung that must be overcome for successful delivery, and which can be divided into anatomic, physical, immunologic, and metabolic barriers. In light of these barriers, successful nonviral polymer-based formulations of therapeutic genes are presented depending on the chemical nature of the polymer. In addition to polyethyleneimine-based nonviral vectors, which have been most intensively studied for pulmonary gene delivery in the past, other polymeric, dendritic, and targeted materials are also described here, including novel and biodegradable polymers. As new materials need in vitro or ex vivo testing before in vivo application, sophisticated models for all three approaches have been illustrated. Although pulmonary siRNA delivery enjoys popularity in clinical trials, pulmonary gene delivery has so far not been translated into clinical applications. With this review, potential hurdles are demonstrated, but novel approaches that may lead to optimized systems are described as well.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c4a","authors":["Olivia M.
