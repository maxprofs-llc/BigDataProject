South Africa currently tests >4million VLs per annum in 16 highly centralised, automated high-throughput laboratories. The Xpert HIV-1 VL assay (Cepheid) was evaluated against in-country predicates, the Roche Cobas Taqmanv2 and Abbott HIV-1RT, to investigate options for expanding VL testing using GeneXpert's random access, polyvalent capabilities and already established footprint in South Africa with the Xpert MTB\/RIF assay (207 sites). Additionally, the performance of Xpert HIV-1VL on alternative, off-label specimen types, Dried Blood Spots (DBS) and whole blood, was investigated.\nPrecision, accuracy (agreement) and clinical misclassification (1000cp\/ml) of Xpert HIV-1VL plasma was compared to Taqmanv2 (n = 155) and Abbott HIV-1 RT (n = 145). Misclassification of Xpert HIV-1VL was further tested on DBS (n = 145) and whole blood (n = 147).\nXpert HIV-1VL demonstrated 100% concordance with predicate platforms on a standardised frozen, plasma panel (n = 42) and low overall percentage similarity CV of 1.5% and 0.9% compared to Taqmanv2 and Abbott HIV-1 RT, respectively. On paired plasma clinical specimens, Xpert HIV-1VL had low bias (SD 0.32-0.37logcp\/ml) and 3% misclassification at the 1000cp\/ml threshold compared to Taqmanv2 (fresh) and Abbott HIV-1 RT (frozen), respectively. Xpert HIV-1VL on whole blood and DBS increased misclassification (upward) by up to 14% with increased invalid rate. All specimen testing was easy to perform and compatible with concurrent Xpert MTB\/RIF Tuberculosis testing on the same instrument.\nThe Xpert HIV-1VL on plasma can be used interchangeably with existing predicate platforms in South Africa. Whole blood and DBS testing requires further investigation, but polyvalency of the GeneXpert offers a solution to extending VL testing services.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Natasha Gous","Lesley Scott","Leigh Berrie","Wendy Stevens"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0168244","first_seen_on":"2016-12-17T06:27:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1483709642,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0168244"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0168244&type=printable","pmcid":"PMC5161463","pmid":"27992495","pubdate":"2016-12-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0168244","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Options to Expand HIV Viral Load Testing in South Africa: Evaluation of the GeneXpert\u00ae HIV-1 Viral Load Assay","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0168244","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/options-expand-hiv-viral-load-testing-south-africa-evaluation-genexpert-hiv1-viral-load-assay"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":3402629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4475941,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237716,"mean":12.517010722924,"rank":100293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":133788,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237716,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112181,"mean":10.352625797825,"rank":46915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":62458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112181,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3845,"mean":12.453850676379,"rank":1675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3845,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
