Among various imaging probes, optical sensors capable of following biological events or progresses at the cellular and molecular levels are actually actively developed for early detection, accurate diagnosis, and monitoring of the treatment of diseases. The optical activities of nanoprobes can be tuned on demand by chemists by engineering their composition, size and surface nature. This review will focus on researches devoted to the conception of nanoprobes with particular optical properties, called persistent luminescence, and their use as new powerful bioimaging agents in preclinical assays.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc86","authors":["L\u00e9cuyer, Thomas","Teston, Eliott","Ramirez-Garcia, Gonzalo","Maldiney, Thomas","Viana, Bruno","Seguin, Johanne","Mignet, Nathalie","Scherman, Daniel","Richard, Cyrille"],"doi":"10.7150\/thno.16589","endpage":"2523","first_seen_on":"2016-12-07T16:00:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1838-7640"],"issue":"13","journal":"Theranostics","last_mentioned_on":1481994467,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27877248"],"pmid":"27877248","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"2488","subjects":["molecularbiology","nanotechnology","diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Chemically engineered persistent luminescence nanoprobes for bioimaging","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemically-engineered-persistent-luminescence-nanoprobes-bioimaging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7902020,"mean":6.6891515940364,"rank":4143480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2203418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7902020,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253763,"mean":12.256573450713,"rank":140043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":89695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253763,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189,"mean":2.5614893617021,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":23.0592,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
