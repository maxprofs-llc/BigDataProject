Novel rehabilitation strategies that apply mobilization and weight bearing have been proposed, but their effects on medial gastrocnemius myotendinous junction displacement (MJD) and isometric plantar-flexion strength (PFS) are unknown.\n\u2003To compare the effects of 12 weeks of immediate versus traditional rehabilitation on MJD and PFS in patients with percutaneous AT repair and to compare AT rupture scores (ATRSs) during follow-up.\n\u2003Controlled laboratory study.\n\u2003Human performance laboratory.\n\u2003A total of 26 amateur soccer players (age = 42.3 \u00b1 9.7 years, body mass index = 29.5 \u00b1 3.9 kg\/m(2)) with percutaneous AT repair.\n\u2003Athletes were randomly divided into 2 groups: an immediate group, given physical therapy from day 1 to day 84, and a traditional group, given physical therapy from day 29 to day 84. We used repeated-measures analysis of variance to compare the data.\n\u2003We measured MJD and PFS at days 28 (fourth week), 56 (eighth week), and 84 (12th week) after AT repair.\n\u2003After 12 weeks of rehabilitation, we observed a large clinically meaningful effect and statistical difference between groups. At day 28, the immediate group showed higher values for PFS (P = .002), MJD (P = .02), and ATRS (P = .002) than the traditional group. At day 56, the immediate group presented higher values for MJD (P = .02) and ATRS (P = .009). At day 84, the immediate group registered more MJD (P = .001).\n\u2003Compared with traditional rehabilitation, 12 weeks of immediate rehabilitation after percutaneous AT repair resulted in better MJD, PFS, and ATRS after 4 weeks; better MJD and ATRS after 8 weeks; and better MJD after 12 weeks.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cae","authors":["Carlos I.
