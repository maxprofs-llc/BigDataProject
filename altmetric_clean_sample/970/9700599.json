However, few studies examine positive outcomes in the face of adversity (resilience) for PHIV+ youth. Social Action Theory (SAT) provided the theoretical framework for this study of PHIV + youth in South Africa (SA), allowing examination of contextual, social, and self-regulatory factors that influence behavioral health. Data were from youth and caregiver baseline interviews, simply pooled from a pilot (N=66) and larger (n=111) randomized control trial (RCT) of the VUKA Family program. For this analysis, outcomes included emotional and behavioral functioning (total difficulties), and prosocial behaviors. Potential SAT correlates included socio-demographics; caregiver health and mental health; parent-child relationship factors; stigma, and child coping, support; and self-esteem. Regression analyses adjusted for age, gender, and study revealed significant associations at the contextual, social, and self-regulation level. Lower total child difficulties scores were associated with lower caregiver depression (\u03b2 = 3.906,p < .001), less caregiver-reported communication about difficult issues (\u03b2 = 1.882, p = .009) and higher youth self-esteem (\u03b2 = -0.119, p = .020). Greater prosocial behaviors were associated with greater caregiver-reported communication (\u03b2 = 0.722, p = .020) and child use of wishful thinking for coping (\u03b2 = 5.532, p = .009). Less youth depression was associated with higher caregiver education (\u03b2 =-0.399, p = .010), greater caregiver supervision (\u03b2 = -1.261, p = .012), more social support seeking (\u03b2 = -0.453, p = .002), higher youth self-esteem (\u03b2 = -0.067, p < .001), lower internalized stigma (\u03b2 = 0.608, p = .040), and child use of resignation for coping (\u03b2 = 1.152, p = .041). Our data support evidence-based family interventions that also promote youth self-regulation skills to enhance the health and mental health of PHIV+ youth.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f61000156b","authors":["Arvin Bhana"],"doi":"10.1080\/09540121.2016.1176676","endpage":"59","first_seen_on":"2016-07-14T16:15:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1360-0451","0954-0121"],"issue":"sup2","journal":"AIDS Care","last_mentioned_on":1470285025,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/09540121.2016.1176676"],"pmid":"27391999","pubdate":"2016-07-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"49","subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Resilience in perinatal HIV+ adolescents in South Africa","type":"article","volume":"28 Suppl 2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resilience-perinatal-hiv-adolescents-south-africa-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166192,"mean":6.9129712202356,"rank":3730848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4354229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166192,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259607,"mean":11.736141183177,"rank":112673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":142479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259607,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1641,"mean":3.8600146341463,"rank":1029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":582,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1641,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":3.8280341880342,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
