The advantages of AF-MSCs and WJ-MSCs over adult MSCs, such as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), include their minimally invasive isolation procedure, their more primitive cell character without being tumourigenic, their low immunogenicity and their potential autologous application in congenital disorders and when cryopreserved in adulthood. This chapter gives an overview of the biology of AF-MSCs and WJ-MSCs, and their regenerative potential based on the results of recent preclinical and clinical studies. In the end, open questions concerning the use of WJ-MSCs and AF-MSCs in regenerative medicine will be emphasized.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c11","authors":["Joerger-Messerli, Marianne S","Marx, Caterina","Oppliger, Byron","Mueller, Martin","Surbek, Daniel V","Schoeberlein, Andreina"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bpobgyn.2015.07.006","first_seen_on":"2015-09-16T09:50:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-6934","1532-1932"],"journal":"Best Practice & Research Clinical Obstetrics & Gynaecology","last_mentioned_on":1445446402,"links":["http:\/\/www.bestpracticeobgyn.com\/article\/S1521-6934(15)00150-9\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26482184"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.bestpracticeobgyn.com\/article\/S1521693415001509\/pdf","pmid":"26482184","pubdate":"2015-10-21T16:53:38+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Mesenchymal Stem Cells from Wharton's Jelly and Amniotic Fluid.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mesenchymal-stem-cells-whartons-jelly-amniotic-fluid-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6356958,"mean":5.9827593932131,"rank":2800466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3387306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6356958,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178242,"mean":10.345536604934,"rank":86860,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":83570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178242,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":2.0449834710744,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.1,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
