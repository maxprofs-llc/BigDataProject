All were planned to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention and randomized within 24 h of symptom onset. Primary safety and efficacy endpoints were time to first occurrence of any major bleeding event and to any event from the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke or death from vascular causes, respectively.At 12 months, overall major bleeding occurred in 10.3% of ticagrelor-treated patients and in 6.8% of clopidogrel-treated patients (hazard ratio (HR), 1.54; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94-2.53); the composite primary efficacy endpoint occurred in 9.0% and in 6.3% of ticagrelor- and clopidogrel-treated patients, respectively (HR, 1.47; 95% CI: 0.88-2.44). For both analyses, the difference between groups was not statistically significant.\nIn ACS patients from Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, event rates of primary safety and efficacy endpoints were higher, albeit not significantly, in ticagrelor-treated patients compared with clopidogrel-treated patients. This observation could be explained by the small sample size, imbalance in clinical characteristics and low number of events in the PHILO population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ec8","authors":["Goto, Shinya","Huang, Chien-Hua","Park, Seung-Jung","Emanuelsson, H\u00e5kan","Kimura, Takeshi"],"doi":"10.1253\/circj.cj-15-0112","first_seen_on":"2015-09-16T02:39:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1347-4820"],"journal":"Circulation Journal","last_mentioned_on":1442375521,"links":["https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/circj\/advpub\/0\/advpub_CJ-15-0112\/_article"],"pmid":"26376600","pubdate":"2015-09-16T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Ticagrelor vs. Clopidogrel in Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome\u3000\u2013 Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III PHILO Study \u2013","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ticagrelor-vs-clopidogrel-japanese-korean-taiwanese-patients-acute-coronary-syndrome-randomized-doub-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6355661,"mean":5.8393093566996,"rank":4695899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":941328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6355661,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185080,"mean":10.054881169663,"rank":127701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":36920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185080,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":684,"mean":1.2758243045388,"rank":254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":684,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":0.5109375,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
