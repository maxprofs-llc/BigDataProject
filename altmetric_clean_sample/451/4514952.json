After delivery, offspring and mothers were exposed to E-cigarette vapors for an additional 14 days from postnatal day 2 through 16. Following their last exposure serum cotinine levels were measured in female juvenile mice. Male mice underwent behavioral testing at 14 weeks of age to assess sensorimotor, affective, and cognitive functional domains.\nAdult male mice exposed to 2.4% nicotine\/PG E-cigarette vapors had significantly more head dips in the zero maze test and higher levels of rearing activity in the open field test compared to 0% nicotine\/PG exposed mice and untreated controls. In the water maze test after reversal training, the 2.4% nicotine\/PG mice spent more than 25% of time in the new location whereas the other groups did not.\nAdult male mice exhibited increased levels of activity in the zero maze and open field tests when exposed to E-cigarette vapor containing nicotine during late prenatal and early postnatal life. These findings indicate that nicotine exposure from E-cigarettes may cause persistent behavioral changes when exposure occurs during a period of rapid brain growth.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Dani Smith","Angela Aherrera","Armando Lopez","Enid Neptune","Jonathan P.
