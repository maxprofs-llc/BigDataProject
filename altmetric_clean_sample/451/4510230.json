Enrolled patients underwent 18F-PET\/CT within 2\u00a0weeks before, during, and months after radiotherapy (post-RT). Metabolic response was assessed using both Peter MacCallum (PM) method of qualitative visual assessment and University of Michigan (UM) method of semiquantitative measurement. The agreement between two methods determined response, and their prediction of outcome was analyzed.\nForty-four patients with median follow-up of 25.2\u00a0months were analyzed. A moderate agreement was observed between PM- and UM-based response assessment (Kappa coefficient\u2009=\u20090.434), unveiling a significant difference in CMR rate (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Categorical responses derived from either method were significantly predictive of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Numerical percentage decrease of FDG uptake also showed significant correlations with survival, presenting a hazard ratio of 0.97 for both OS and PFS. A 75\u00a0% of SUV decrease was found to be the optimal cutoff to predict OS and 2-year progression.\nThere was a modest discrepancy in metabolic response rates between PM and UM criteria, though both could offer predictive classification for survival. The percentage decrease provides an ordinal value that correlates with prolonged survival, recommending 75\u00a0% as the optimal threshold at identifying better responders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8103cf058f61000bb33","authors":["Wang, Jingbo","Wong, Ka Kit","Piert, Morand","Stanton, Paul","Frey, Kirk A","Kong, Feng-Ming Spring"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13566-015-0184-9","first_seen_on":"2015-09-15T10:22:45+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1948-7894"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Radiation Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1442349488,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26366253?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26366253?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26366253","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Radiotherapy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgical Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Metabolic response assessment with (18)F-FDG PET\/CT: inter-method comparison and prognostic significance for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolic-response-assessment-18ffdg-petct-intermethod-comparison-prognostic-significance-patients-n"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6344720,"mean":5.8380026440887,"rank":2796414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3377753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6344720,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196487,"mean":9.8057520739391,"rank":96370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":91611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196487,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":8.5816,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.55,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/molecularimging\/statuses\/643728173205704704","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4510230],"posted_on":"2015-09-15T10:08:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Molecular Imaging","url":"http:\/\/www.medjournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1081930767\/fdg_normal.PNG","description":"PET\/CT, MRI, CT, and other molecular imaging news and updates.
