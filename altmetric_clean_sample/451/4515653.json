Special progress has been made in the field of genotrichoses, or hereditary hair diseases, a field that has been obscure for many years. The underlying genes for many of the monogenic hair diseases are now known. Additionally, complex analyses of large cohorts of patients have given us the first clues to the genes associated with polygenic hair disorders, such as androgenetic alopecia and alopecia areata. Thanks to these major findings, the sophisticated regulation of the morphogenesis, development and growth of hair follicles has begun to be revealed, and new players in this delicate molecular interplay have been exposed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000707f","authors":["Ramot, Yuval","Zlotogorski, Abraham"],"doi":"10.1159\/000369408","first_seen_on":"2015-09-16T10:07:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1662-2944"],"journal":"Current Problems in Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1442398751,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26370647?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26370647","pubdate":"2015-09-16T22:00:55+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Molecular Genetics of Alopecias.","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-genetics-alopecias"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6354076,"mean":5.8388740315468,"rank":2799784,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3383458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6354076,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184867,"mean":10.063921445804,"rank":90923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":85822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184867,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":3.8680298507463,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
