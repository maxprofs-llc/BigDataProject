Unlike the computation of periodic orbits or the symbolic dynamical approach by the Markov partition, the method presented here does not require any special techniques in computational and mathematical fields to calculate these quantities. In spite of its simplicity, our method can accurately capture not only the chaotic region but also the non-chaotic region (window region) such that it is important physically but the (Lebesgue) measure zero and usually hard to calculate or observe. Furthermore, it is shown that the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of the Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen measure (the physical measure) coincides with the topological entropy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024db","authors":["Chihiro Matsuoka","Chihiro Matsuoka","Koichi Hiraide"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4930956","first_seen_on":"2015-09-16T16:23:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1089-7682"],"issue":"10","journal":"Chaos","last_mentioned_on":1442417264,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aip\/journal\/chaos\/25\/10\/10.1063\/1.4930956?TRACK=RSS"],"pmid":"26520076","pubdate":"2015-09-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AIP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Numerical And Computational Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Mathematics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Computation of entropy and Lyapunov exponent by a shift transform","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/computation-entropy-lyapunov-exponent-shift-transform"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6354076,"mean":5.8388740315468,"rank":5412828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6354076,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184868,"mean":10.063869982203,"rank":147962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184868,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":762,"mean":4.6629461235217,"rank":347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":762,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":2.3696603773585,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
