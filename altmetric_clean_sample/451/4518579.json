Reslizumab is one of the three monoclonal antibodies targeting the IL-5 pathway and has been found in Phase IIIb clinical trials to reduce asthma exacerbations, control asthma-related symptoms and improve pulmonary function in patients with eosinophilic asthma. Areas covered: In this article, we discuss the results of asthma clinical trials using reslizumab, beginning with a discussion of the relationship between eosinophils, IL-5 and asthma. We conducted PubMed searches using the terms 'reslizumab', 'anti-IL-5', 'eosinophilic asthma', 'IL-5 asthma'. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov for 'reslizumab', 'reslizumab asthma', 'SCH 55700', 'SCH 55700 asthma', 'Cinquil' and 'Cinquil asthma'. Expert opinion: Reslizumab and other anti-IL-5 therapies have seen success in recent trials through more stringent study participant selection targeting eosinophilic inflammation. This selection can now be based on simple blood counts. These drugs have shown a very good safety profile, but long-term safety data are not yet available. Approval for these drugs is eagerly awaited by clinicians and patients alike.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073bf","authors":["Cardet, Juan Carlos","Israel, Elliot"],"doi":"10.1517\/14712598.2015.1090972","first_seen_on":"2015-09-16T12:31:50+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["1744-7682","1471-2598"],"issue":"10","journal":"Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1460716627,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26372797?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26372797","pubdate":"2015-09-16T22:00:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Update on reslizumab for eosinophilic asthma.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/update-reslizumab-eosinophilic-asthma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7554544,"mean":6.5226894405088,"rank":6543342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7554544,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":217439,"mean":9.3612674785457,"rank":181084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":217439,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":892,"mean":2.5777575757576,"rank":767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":892,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.7678571428571,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/asthma_papers\/statuses\/644126471762477057","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4518579],"posted_on":"2015-09-16T12:31:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Asthma Papers","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439482171208646656\/OWe4b0kE_normal.jpeg","description":"RSS feed for #asthma papers in #Pubmed.
