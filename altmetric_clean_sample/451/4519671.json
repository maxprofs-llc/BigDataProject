This column offers a distinction between clinical and forensic roles in terms of responsibilities, objectives, and guiding ethical principles. Existing professional guidelines and other views from the medical literature that discourage the mixing of such roles are reviewed. The conflation of clinical and forensic roles and the attendant risks are considered, in terms of both competing interests and the possible ethical threat associated with assuming a dual role. Knowingly or unwittingly assuming a dual role is potentially harmful to the therapeutic alliance, threatens the expert's objectivity, and may jeopardize a patient's legal case. Guidance is offered as to how to avoid conflating clinical and forensic roles when compelled to provide medicolegal services.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a96","authors":["Richards, Paul M","Wortzel, Hal S"],"doi":"10.1097\/pra.0000000000000093","first_seen_on":"2015-09-16T17:08:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1538-1145","1527-4160"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of psychiatric practice (Print)","last_mentioned_on":1442423292,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/practicalpsychiatry\/Abstract\/2015\/09000\/Avoiding_Dual_Agency_in_Clinical_and_Medicolegal.6.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/practicalpsychiatry\/2015\/09000\/Avoiding_Dual_Agency_in_Clinical_and_Medicolegal.6.pdf","pmid":"26352223","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"370","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Avoiding Dual Agency in Clinical and Medicolegal Practice","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/avoiding-dual-agency-clinical-medicolegal-practice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6354076,"mean":5.8388740315468,"rank":4694278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":941277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6354076,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184868,"mean":10.063869982203,"rank":127532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":36906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184868,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":585,"mean":3.5383561643836,"rank":415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":585,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":14.168181818182,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":3,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Psychology":1,"Computer Science":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JPP_online\/statuses\/644196095610847232","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4519671],"posted_on":"2015-09-16T17:08:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Jrnl Psych Practice","url":"http:\/\/www.psychiatricpractice.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1244448647\/aa_normal.jpg","description":"Journal of Psychiatric Practice combines clinically applicable reviews, case studies, and articles on treatment advances.","id_on_source":"JPP_online","tweeter_id":"252259327","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":39},"tweet_id":"644196095610847232"}]}}
