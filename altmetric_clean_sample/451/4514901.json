Moreover, the amount of NGF protein was assessed by measuring the NGF levels in culture supernatants of the T cell clones before stimulation and 48 hours after phytohemagglutinin (PHA) activation by use of an immunoenzymatic assay.\nOur data have shown that in unstimulated conditions, human CD4+ T cell clones express both immunoreactivity for NGF and the TrkA NGF receptor irrespective of their cytokine profile. Moreover, T(H1) and T(H2) clones, but not T(H0) clones, secrete NGF in basal conditions. PHA activation induces NGF secretion in T(H0) clones and a significant increase of NGF levels in T(H2) (p < 0.05), but not in T(H1) culture supernatants.\nResults obtained represent the first evidence of TrkA expression and NGF production and release in human CD4+ cell clones and suggest a possible functional role of NGF in modulating the immune and inflammatory network.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b59","authors":["Lambiase, A","Bracci-Laudiero, L","Bonini, S","Bonini, S","Starace, G","D'Elios, M M","De Carli, M","Aloe, L"],"first_seen_on":"2015-09-16T06:04:12+00:00","issns":["0091-6749"],"issue":"3","journal":"The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1441805229,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9314355"],"pmid":"9314355","pubdate":"1997-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Human CD4+ T cell clones produce and release nerve growth factor and express high-affinity nerve growth factor receptors.","type":"article","volume":"100","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-cd4-t-cell-clones-produce-release-nerve-growth-factor-express-highaffinity-nerve-growth-factor-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6316402,"mean":5.8232968593997,"rank":1425022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":4263963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6316402,"percentile":67},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184399,"mean":10.060091378431,"rank":57092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":125214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184399,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3696,"mean":8.4035956698241,"rank":1570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":1792,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3696,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":11.262425,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
