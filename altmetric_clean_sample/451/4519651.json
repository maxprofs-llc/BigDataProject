Lesions only involving substantia nigra on magnetic resonance imaging are uncommon, especially in children. A second encephalitis illness after encephalitis lethargica has never been reported before.\nWe describe a 7-year-old boy with humoral immunity deficiency who developed encephalitis lethargica associated with bilateral substantia nigra lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. After a nearly complete recovery, he developed encephalitis once again. He was diagnosed with encephalitis lethargica with somnolence, akinetic mutism, and ophthalmoplegia after intermittent fever. Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis and positive oligoclonal bands were documented. Symmetrical substantia nigra lesions on high-intensity magnetic resonance imaging gradually evolved into a liquid signal. He had almost recovered when he developed fatigue and hypersomnia and was diagnosed with encephalitis again, supported by mild pleocytosis in cerebrospinal fluid and subcortical white matter lesions in the frontal lobes. His symptoms resolved following administration of corticosteroids and immunoglobulins.\nThis is the first report of an immune-deficient child to develop encephalitis lethargica with isolated substantia nigra lesions on magnetic resonance imaging and a second encephalitis illness after recovery from encephalitis lethargica.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032b1","authors":["Yang, Lu","Jia, Guijuan","Li, Baomin","Lei, Gefei","Sun, Ruopeng"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pediatrneurol.2015.03.030","first_seen_on":"2015-09-16T17:05:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0887-8994","1873-5150"],"journal":"Pediatric Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1442423084,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0887899415001782"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pedneur.com\/article\/S0887899415001782\/pdf","pmid":"26431898","pubdate":"2015-10-04T22:00:33+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology","pediatrics"],"title":"Encephalitis lethargica with isolated substantia nigra lesions on MRI followed by a second encephalitis in a boy with humoral immunity deficiency","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/encephalitis-lethargica-isolated-substantia-nigra-lesions-followed-second-encephalitis-child-humoral"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6354289,"mean":5.8389329725063,"rank":4694804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":941040,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6354289,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184928,"mean":10.06168543263,"rank":127587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":36906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184928,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":993,"mean":2.3412701612903,"rank":561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":993,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.1574074074074,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
