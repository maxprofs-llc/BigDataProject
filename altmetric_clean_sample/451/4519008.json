The goal of this study is to evaluate the patient perspective of ICD indication and its relation to quality of life, as well as to identify probable communication gaps between doctors and ICD receivers.\nA total of 119 patients with HF who were implanted with a single-chamber ICD were evaluated in outpatient clinics. Patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillators were not included in the study. In a questionnaire, patients were asked about the indication of the ICD procedure and classified according to the perceived benefits.\nThis study showed that most of the patients (n\u00a0=\u00a092, 77.3%) believed that ICD was implanted for improvement of heart dysfunction or for symptom relief. According to the perceived benefit groups, physical function, general health, vitality, and role physical scores were significantly lower in the symptom relief group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nPatients with HF and ICD mostly believed that the cardioverter defibrillator implanted for improving heart function or symptom relief. Doctors play a significant role when a patient is first referred for ICD because less-informed patients are more prone to misunderstand the procedure's benefits. Moreover, unfulfilled expectations may lead to loss of confidence in applied therapies and result in poor health outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"52d3d3e886a348c7778b46b4","authors":["Kevser G\u00fclcihan Balci","Mustafa M\u00fccahit Balci","Mehmet Kadri Akbo\u011fa","Fatih Sen","Burak A\u00e7ar","Samet Y\u0131lmaz","Emek Edibo\u011flu","Orhan Maden","Hatice Selcuk","Mehmet Timur Selcuk","Ahmet Temizhan","Sinan Aydo\u011fdu"],"doi":"10.1007\/s40119-015-0049-8","first_seen_on":"2015-09-16T14:16:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2193-6544","2193-8261"],"journal":"Cardiology and Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1442932338,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs40119-015-0049-8"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs40119-015-0049-8.pdf","pmid":"26370831","pubdate":"2015-09-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Healthcare","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Perceived Benefits of Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Implantation among Heart Failure Patients and Its Relation to Quality of Life: A Cross-Sectional Study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/perceived-benefits-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator-implantation-among-heart-failure-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6386702,"mean":5.8553449560254,"rank":5441752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6386702,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185475,"mean":10.052097706417,"rank":148576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185475,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":0.8228813559322,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.4375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
