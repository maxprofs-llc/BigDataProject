The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of Cerebrolysin in the treatment of communication defects in infants with severe perinatal brain insult.\nA randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in which 158 infants (age 6-21 months) with communication defects due to severe perinatal brain insult were enrolled; 120 infants completed the study. The Cerebrolysin group (n=60) received twice-weekly Cerebrolysin injections of 0.1 mL\/kg body weight for 5 weeks (total of ten injections). The placebo group (n=60) received the same amount and number of normal saline injections.\nThe baseline Communication and Symbolic-Behavior-Scale-Developmental Profile scores were comparable between the two groups. After 3 months, the placebo group exhibited improvements in the social (p<0.01) and speech composite (p=0.02) scores, with 10% and 1.5% increases from baseline, respectively. The scores of the Cerebrolysin group changed from concern to no concern, with increases of 65.44%, 45.54%, 358.06%, and 96.00% from baseline in the social (p<0.001), speech (p<0.001), symbolic (p<0.001), and total (p<0.001) scores.\nCerebrolysin dramatically improved infants' communication especially symbolic behavior which positively affected social interaction. These findings suggest that cerebrolysin may be an effective and feasible way equivalent to stem cell therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc40","authors":["Hassanein, Sahar M A","Deifalla, Shaymaa M","El-Houssinie, Moustafa","Mokbel, Somaia A"],"first_seen_on":"2015-09-15T18:48:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1738-6586"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Neurology (Seoul, Korea)","last_mentioned_on":1442321954,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26365023"],"pmid":"26365023","pubdate":"2015-09-11T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"title":"Safety and Efficacy of Cerebrolysin in Infants with Communication Defects due to Severe Perinatal Brain Insult: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-efficacy-cerebrolysin-infants-communication-defects-due-severe-perinatal-brain-insult-randomi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6346290,"mean":5.8391295297143,"rank":5406631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6346290,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196517,"mean":9.8060588043722,"rank":157070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196517,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":3.2296440677966,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":4.92,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
