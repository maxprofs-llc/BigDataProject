Although they occur sparsely in other plant families, cyclotides have been detected in every Violaceae plant species so far screened. Many of the Violaceae species examined until now have been from closely related geographical regions or habitats. To test the hypothesis that cyclotides are ubiquitous in this family, two geographically isolated (and critically endangered) species of Australasian Violaceae, namely Melicytus chathamicus and M. latifolius were examined. Surprisingly, we discovered a suite of cyclotides possessing novel sequence features, including a lysine-rich nature, distinguishing them from 'conventional' cyclotides and suggesting that they might have different physiological activities in plants to those reported to date. The newly discovered cyclotides were found to bind to lipid membranes and were cytotoxic against cancer cell lines but had low toxicity against red blood cells, which is advantageous for potential therapeutic applications. This suite of novel Lys-rich cyclotides emphasizes the broad diversity of cyclotides in Violaceae species.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006811","authors":["Anjaneya S.
