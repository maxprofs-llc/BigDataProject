However, the role of SKP1 in citrus is unclear. Herein, we described a novel SKP1-like gene, designated as CrWSKP1, from \"Wuzishatangju\" (Citrus reticulata Blanco). The cDNA sequence of CrWSKP1 is 779 base pairs (bp) and contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 477 bp. The genomic sequence of the CrWSKP1 gene is 1296 bp with two exons and one intron. CrWSKP1 has high identity with SKP1-like genes from other plant species within two conserved regions. Approximately 85% of pollen tubes of self-pollinated CrWSKP1 transgenic tobaccos became twisted at four days after self-pollination. Pollen tube numbers of self-pollinated CrWSKP1 transformants entering into ovules were significantly fewer than that of the control. Seed number of self-pollinated CrWSKP1 transformants was significantly reduced. These results suggested that the CrWSKP1 is involved in the self-incompatibility (SI) reaction of \"Wuzishatangju\".","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Li, Peng","Miao, Hongxia","Ma, Yuewen","Wang, Lu","Hu, Guibing","Ye, Zixing","Zhao, Jietang","Qin, Yonghua"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms160921695","first_seen_on":"2015-09-16T10:10:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"9","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1442398203,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26370985?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26370985","pubdate":"2015-09-16T22:00:46+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"CrWSKP1, an SKP1-like Gene, Is Involved in the Self-Incompatibility Reaction of \"Wuzishatangju\" (Citrus reticulata Blanco).","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crwskp1-skp1like-gene-involved-selfincompatibility-reaction-wuzishatangju-citrus-reticulata-blanco"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6355661,"mean":5.8393093566996,"rank":5414736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6355661,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185080,"mean":10.054881169663,"rank":148161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185080,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3297,"mean":2.2254745145631,"rank":2340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3297,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266,"mean":1.6299547169811,"rank":183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
