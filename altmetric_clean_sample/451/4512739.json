The genome consists of 156\u2009324\u2009bp containing a pair of inverted repeats (IRs) of 26\u2009105\u2009bp, which was separated by a large single-copy region and a small single-copy region of 86\u2009082\u2009bp and 18\u2009032\u2009bp, respectively. The P. notoginseng cp genome encodes 114 unigenes (80 protein-coding genes, 4 rRNA genes, and 30 tRNA genes), in which 18 are duplicated in the IR regions. The genic regions account for 51.1% of whole cp genome, and the GC content of the plastome was 38.1%. A phylogenomic analysis of the 10 complete chloroplast genomes from Araliaceae using Hydrocotyle verticillata outgroup showed that P. notoginseng is closely related to P. ginseng that belongs to the genus Panax.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f610004220","authors":["Zhang, Dan","Li, Wei","Gao, Chengwen","Liu, Yuan","Gao, Li-Zhi"],"doi":"10.3109\/19401736.2015.1063131","first_seen_on":"2015-09-15T17:45:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-1744"],"journal":"Mitochondrial DNA: The Journal of DNA Mapping, Sequencing & Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1442339103,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26365031?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26365031","pubdate":"2015-09-15T22:01:32+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"The complete plastid genome sequence of Panax notoginseng, a famous traditional Chinese medicinal plant of the family Araliaceae.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-plastid-genome-sequence-ipanax-notoginsengi-famous-traditional-chinese-medicinal-plant-fami"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6344720,"mean":5.8380026440887,"rank":5405493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6344720,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196486,"mean":9.8057994350713,"rank":157043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196486,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1443,"mean":0.72203328710125,"rank":553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1443,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134,"mean":0.81428571428571,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BG":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/phy_papers\/statuses\/643842981590646784","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4512739],"posted_on":"2015-09-15T17:45:03+00:00","author":{"name":"phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/438115152294989824\/0M7ZG0xC_normal.jpeg","description":"Continuous feed for phylogenetics papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
