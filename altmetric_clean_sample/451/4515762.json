There is tremendous need of compounds facilitating oral delivery of DTX. The research was aimed to investigate the effect of piperlongumine (PPL) on human liver microsomal metabolism, Caco-2 permeability, and cytotoxicity of DTX in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. Reduction in testosterone and DTX metabolism (twofold increase in half-life) by PPL was comparable to the standard CYP3A4 inhibitor, cyclosporine A. P-gp efflux ratio of DTX across caco-2 monolayer was reduced from 2.37 to 1.52 on co-incubation with PPL. The IC50 value of DTX was reduced three to five times and combination index values in all the cell lines were below 0.6. PPL at non-cytotoxic concentration showed significant enhancement of the antimigration effect of DTX. Expression of tumor markers such as survivin, bcl2, C-myc, and cyclin D1 were downregulated to a great extent with enhanced p53 expression when treated with combination instead of individual drug. Co-treatment with PPL led to 1.68-fold enhancement in DTX bioavailability in SD rats. PPL could be a potential candidate in overcoming the obstacles associated with oral DTX delivery with synergistic anticancer activity. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040a0","authors":["Patel, Ketan","Chowdhury, Nusrat","Doddapaneni, Ravi","Boakye, Cedar H A","Godugu, Chandraiah","Singh, Mandip"],"doi":"10.1002\/jps.24637","endpage":"4426","first_seen_on":"2015-09-16T10:11:56+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci","nigms"],"issns":["1520-6017","00223549"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1442399374,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26372815?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26372815","pubdate":"2015-09-16T22:00:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"4417","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Piperlongumine for Enhancing Oral Bioavailability and Cytotoxicity of Docetaxel in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.","type":"article","volume":"104","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/piperlongumine-enhancing-oral-bioavailability-cytotoxicity-docetaxel-triplenegative-breast-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6354182,"mean":5.8389730953527,"rank":2799907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3383434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6354182,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184912,"mean":10.062254284494,"rank":90945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":85849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184912,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":774,"mean":2.6315394566624,"rank":350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":774,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.1942857142857,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
