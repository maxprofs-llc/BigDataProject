The effect of post-synthesis treatment using conventional hydrothermal was also investigated. The synthesized powders were characterized by XRD, TGA\/DTA, SEM, and PSD analysis. The results showed that, increasing the sonication time (energy) has no significant effect on the product's morphology. The crystallinity of the synthesized samples increased slightly with increasing sonication time, but their yield remained relatively unchanged. Furthermore, post-synthesis hydrothermal treatment showed very little influence on properties of the final product. Because the ultrasonic irradiation creates acoustic cavitation cracks on the surface structure of clinoptilolite particulates and increases the concentration of soluble alumino-silicate species, which favors the prevailing super-saturation, crystallization and crystal growth of zeolite NaP happen faster. The particles of zeolite NaP synthesized by ultrasonic irradiation consist of small crystallites of uniform size.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036d1","authors":["Behin, Jamshid","Kazemian, Hossein","Rohani, Sohrab"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ultsonch.2015.08.021","first_seen_on":"2015-09-16T13:18:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2828","13504177"],"journal":"Ultrasonics Sonochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1442409494,"links":["http:\/\/authors.elsevier.com\/a\/1Rj2X4p3AWE0TZ"],"pmid":"26341462","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
