Food shopping, meal planning, preparation and cooking skills are valuable in supporting good health. Thus experts are proposing nutritional counseling be expanded to include these beneficial behavioral skills. Educational programs delivered by chefs have recently emerged as a way to improve engagement with nutritional guidelines. It is reasonable to assume that a chef with behavior change knowledge and skills, such as coaching, may be more effective in facilitating behavior change. We encourage chefs who wish to be involved in promoting health-related behavior change to consider continuing education in coaching knowledge and skills. We also recommend culinary schools to consider offering these courses, to aspiring chefs. Such programming will not only benefit future clients but also offers a career- enriching professional opportunity to chefs. Credentialed chefs can make a positive health impact and should be included as professionals who are eligible for the impending national certification of health and wellness coaches.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002751","authors":["Polak, Rani","Sforzo, Gary A","Dill, Diana","Phillips, Edward M","Moore, Margaret"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.eatbeh.2015.06.016","first_seen_on":"2015-09-15T16:38:06+00:00","issns":["1873-7358","14710153"],"journal":"Eating Behaviors","last_mentioned_on":1469093991,"links":["http:\/\/authors.elsevier.com\/a\/1RLZr5EU5nJquR","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1471015315000859","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26172566"],"pmid":"26172566","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Credentialed Chefs as Certified Wellness Coaches: Call for Action.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/credentialed-chefs-certified-wellness-coaches-call-action"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088508,"mean":6.8823654995833,"rank":1691240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6386408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088508,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233280,"mean":9.3460072702643,"rank":56255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":176561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233280,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":509,"mean":6.2277795275591,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":509,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.095,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":7,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
