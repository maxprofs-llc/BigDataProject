Even though the program can be accessed after completion of one of several primary specialties, the vast majority (97%) of its residents enter the program after having completed training in family medicine. A change to develop a primary EM specialty is being discussed. Our objective was to assess French residents and young EM physicians' attitudes toward EM as a primary specialty. We conducted a brief cross-sectional online survey among young EM physicians and trainees in November and December 2012. There were 288 respondents to the survey. Forty-nine percent (n=142) of respondents would have chosen EM if it was a primary specialty, but 73% (n=209) prefer maintaining the status quo, offering EM training as a supra-specialty fellowship program. Work-related quality of life was the main reason for those not choosing EM as a primary specialty.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002534","authors":["Yordanov, Youri","Sobotka, Jennifer","Dahan, Benjamin","Jacquin, Laurent","Kalpokdjian, Aur\u00e9lie","Pateron, Dominique"],"doi":"10.1017\/cem.2014.64","first_seen_on":"2015-04-02T07:54:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1481-8035","1481-8043"],"issue":"06","journal":"CJEM: Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1447807532,"links":["http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?aid=9620363&fileId=S1481803514000645&fromPage=online","http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10002036&fulltextType=ED&fileId=S1481803514000645","http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10002036&fileId=S1481803514000645"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/article_S1481803514000645","pmid":"26012721","pubdate":"2015-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Emergency medicine as a primary specialty\u2014French emergency medicine residents\u2019 attitudes","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emergency-medicine-primary-specialtyfrench-emergency-medicine-residents-attitudes-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6581713,"mean":6.1066319197804,"rank":2246370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4314856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6581713,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167620,"mean":10.071034906544,"rank":62423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":104246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167620,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":423,"mean":6.2661090047393,"rank":241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":423,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":7.7762264150943,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
