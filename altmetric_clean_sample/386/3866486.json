This article describes a framework for evaluating implementation of hospital to ambulatory care transitions interventions and application to a case study. We searched published and gray literature for relevant frameworks. We adapted the general Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, adding elements relevant to other complex interventions. We refined these adaptations through structured expert input and application to case studies. Key adaptations included conceptualization around organizations, not just settings, and around patient- and caregiver-centeredness. Although these interventions are often oriented toward institutional outcomes such as readmissions, tailoring interventions to specific patient needs strengthens effectiveness. Coordination and communication are important between organizations and providers and with patients and caregivers. Roles of those involved in the intervention-providers, administrators, and facilitators from different organizations-are also key constructs. Finally, as these interventions often are tailored to specific settings and adapt over time, assessing intervention design-which components are implemented as part of the bundle, how they are actually implemented, and their differential impact on effectiveness-is critical.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059e4","authors":["Dy, Sydney M","Ashok, Mahima","Wines, Roberta C","Rojas Smith, Lucia"],"doi":"10.1097\/01.jhq.0000460121.06309.f9","first_seen_on":"2015-04-02T23:29:38+00:00","funders":["niehs","phs"],"issns":["1062-2551","1945-1474"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal for Healthcare Quality: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare","last_mentioned_on":1446157688,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jhqonline\/Fulltext\/2015\/01000\/A_Framework_to_Guide_Implementation_Research_for.6.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26042376"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jhqonline\/2015\/01000\/A_Framework_to_Guide_Implementation_Research_for.6.pdf","pmid":"26042376","pubdate":"2015-06-05T22:01:06+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"41","subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"A framework to guide implementation research for care transitions interventions.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/framework-guide-implementation-research-care-transitions-interventions-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6504996,"mean":6.0272765079752,"rank":3080360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1944390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6504996,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166587,"mean":10.069913390081,"rank":94859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":54416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166587,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191,"mean":5.4913578947368,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":26.066666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"A Framework to Guide Implementation Research for Care Transi... : Journal for Healthcare Quality","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/636540302\/posts\/972547226118834","license":"public","citation_ids":[3866486],"posted_on":"2015-04-02T23:28:40+00:00","summary":"journals.lww.com","author":{"name":"Khalid Waleed Alsahly","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/636540302","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/636540302\/picture","id_on_source":"636540302"}},{"title":"A Framework to Guide Implementation Research for Care Transi... : Journal for Healthcare Quality","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=10153186496546944&id=132595246943","license":"public","citation_ids":[3866486],"posted_on":"2015-04-02T20:59:59+00:00","summary":"Did you know that deficits in quality of care for #caretransitions from the hospital to the ambulatory setting results in approximately 20% rates of readmissions and preventable adverse events, according to the Special Issue of the #JHQ?","author":{"name":"National Association for Healthcare Quality (NAHQ)","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/132595246943","facebook_wall_name":"National Association for Healthcare Quality (NAHQ)","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/132595246943\/picture","id_on_source":"132595246943"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TRECResearch\/statuses\/659859285912883200","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[3866486],"posted_on":"2015-10-29T22:28:08+00:00","author":{"name":"TREC","url":"http:\/\/www.trec.ualberta.ca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/546009913810366464\/e2BT5TrN_normal.jpeg","description":"Research program focused on developing solutions for improving the quality of care provided to nursing home residents.","id_on_source":"TRECResearch","tweeter_id":"2328276679","geo":{"lt":53.55014,"ln":-113.46871,"country":"CA"},"followers":857},"tweet_id":"659859285912883200"}]}}
