The C atoms of the two tert-butyl group bonded to the cyclo-penta-dienyl (Cp) ring are 0.132\u2005(5) and 0.154\u2005(6)\u2005\u00c5 above the Cp least-squares plane. There are no significant inter-molecular inter-actions present between the mol-ecules in the crystal structure.","authors":["P"],"doi":"10.1107\/s205698901500585x","first_seen_on":"2015-04-03T00:00:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2056-9890"],"issue":"Pt 5","journal":"Acta crystallographica.
