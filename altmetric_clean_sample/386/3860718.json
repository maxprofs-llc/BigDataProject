Although synaptic feedback regulation of photoreceptors is known to occur in Drosophila, many questions about the underlying molecular mechanisms and physiological implementation remain unclear. Here, we systematically investigated these questions using a broad range of experimental methods. We isolated two Ih mutant fly lines that exhibit rhythmic photoreceptor depolarization without light stimulation. We discovered that Ih channels regulate glutamate release from amacrine cells by modulating calcium channel activity. Moreover, we showed that the eye-enriched kainate receptor (EKAR) is expressed in photoreceptors and receives the glutamate signal released from amacrine cells. Finally, we presented evidence that amacrine cell feedback regulation helps maintain light sensitivity in ambient light. Our findings suggest plausible molecular underpinnings and physiological effects of feedback regulation from amacrine cells to photoreceptors. These results provide new mechanistic insight into how synaptic feedback regulation can participate in network processing by modulating neural information transfer and circuit excitability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003348","authors":["Wen Hu","Tingting Wang","Xiao Wang","Junhai Han"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pbio.1002115","first_seen_on":"2015-04-01T19:35:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1545-7885"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS Biology","last_mentioned_on":1428447909,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosbiology\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1002115","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25831426?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/feeds.plos.org\/~r\/plosbiology\/NewArticles\/~3\/-gpUX_vwO9w\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1002115"],"pmid":"25831426","pubdate":"2015-04-02T22:00:23+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"I h Channels Control Feedback Regulation from Amacrine Cells to Photoreceptors","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/iinfhinf-channels-control-feedback-regulation-amacrine-cells-photoreceptors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4968581,"mean":5.8840996626831,"rank":924656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4021211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4968581,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147186,"mean":10.267139939532,"rank":38865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":107940,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147186,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2766,"mean":28.898528028933,"rank":1743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2766,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":94.501324999999,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CN":1,"KR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nebiogroup\/status\/583351771734491136","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3860718],"posted_on":"2015-04-01T19:34:35+00:00","author":{"name":"New England BioGroup","url":"http:\/\/www.nebiogroup.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1851186090\/logo-fb_normal.png","description":"Offering premiere life science products and services to New England area researchers.","id_on_source":"nebiogroup","tweeter_id":"122073305","geo":{"lt":42.83842,"ln":-71.147,"country":"US"},"followers":122},"tweet_id":"583351771734491136"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ScienceEnabled\/status\/583422490451513344","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3860718],"posted_on":"2015-04-02T00:15:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Science Enabled","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1579522693\/scienceenabled-star_normal.png","description":"Science rules!","id_on_source":"ScienceEnabled","tweeter_id":"387514741","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1493},"tweet_id":"583422490451513344"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SynapsePapers\/status\/583573619818639361","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3860718],"posted_on":"2015-04-02T10:16:07+00:00","author":{"name":"SynapsePapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/566055028952018944\/nOqlF7Cg_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot bringing you new papers on neuronal synapses.
