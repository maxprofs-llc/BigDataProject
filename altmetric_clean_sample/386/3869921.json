Evidence suggests that healthy adults with elevated cortical A\u03b2 show differences in neural activity associated with memory encoding-specifically encoding of face stimuli. Here, we examined if A\u03b2 deposition in clinically normal adults was related to differences in neural activity in ventral visual cortex during face viewing. Our sample included 23 high-A\u03b2 older adults, 23 demographically matched low-A\u03b2 older adults, and 16 young adults. Participants underwent cognitive testing, A\u03b2 positron emission tomography imaging with (18) F-Florbetapir, and functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure neural activity while participants passively viewed photographs of faces. Using barycentric discriminant analysis-a between-groups classification technique-we found that patterns of neural activity in the left fusiform gyrus, a region highly responsive to faces, distinguished A\u03b2 status of participants. Older adults with elevated A\u03b2 were characterized by decreased activity in left fusiform compared to A\u03b2-negative older adults. Further, we found that the degree to which older adults expressed decreased fusiform activity was related to worse performance on tasks of processing speed. Our results provide unique evidence that, in addition to previously studied memory and default regions, decreased neural activity in a region important for face perception was associated with elevated A\u03b2 and may be an early manifestation of AD.
