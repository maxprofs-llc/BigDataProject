Although fear is an evolutionarily advantageous emotion, under certain pathologies such as panic disorder it might become exaggerated and non-adaptive. Clinical and preclinical work pinpoints that changes in cognitive processes, such as perception and interpretation of environmental stimuli that rely on brain regions responsible for high-level function, are essential for the development of fear-related disorders. This review focuses on the involvement of cognitive function to fear circuitry disorders. Moreover, we address how animal models are contributing to understand the involvement of human candidate genes to pathological fear and helping achieve progress in this field. Multidisciplinary approaches that integrate human genetic findings with state of the art genetic mouse models will allow to elucidate the mechanisms underlying pathology and to develop new strategies for therapeutic targeting.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000284e","authors":["Santos, M\u00f3nica","D'Amico, Davide","Dierssen, Mara"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejphar.2015.03.039","first_seen_on":"2015-04-02T16:02:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0712","00142999"],"journal":"European Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1428302369,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0014299915002563"],"pmid":"25818748","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"From neural to genetic substrates of panic disorder: Insights from human and mouse studies ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neural-genetic-substrates-panic-disorder-insights-human-mouse-studies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4964014,"mean":5.8803944095254,"rank":2411577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2503671,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4964014,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146003,"mean":10.301648429474,"rank":75988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":68568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146003,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2038,"mean":2.415676975945,"rank":1188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":844,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2038,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.2409090909091,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
