Although gadoxetate disodium is commonly used for detection and characterization of focal lesions, a spectrum of diffuse disease processes can affect the hepatobiliary phase of imaging (i.e., when contrast accumulates within the hepatocytes). Non-focal signal abnormalities during the hepatobiliary phase can be seen with multiple disease processes such as deposition disorders, infiltrating tumors, vascular diseases, and post-treatment changes. The purpose of this paper is to review the different processes which result in non-focal signal alteration during the hepatobiliary phase and to describe imaging patterns that may order a differential diagnosis and facilitate patient management.","authors":["Alessandro Furlan","Amir A.
