Triploidy was induced through the application of heat shock of 28\u00b0C for 10min to eggs 10-min post fertilization in an aquarium equipped with a heater. Percentage of skeletal deformity in heat-shocked larvae (2.88\u00b10.30, mean\u00b1S.E.) was significantly (P<0.05) greater than that of the diploids (0.55\u00b10.24). At five days after hatching, proteins of normal and deformed specimens of deyolked larvae were subjected to proteomic analysis using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Among the identified protein spots from diploids, creatine kinase was found to be increased in larvae with skeletal deformities, while apolipoprotein A-I-2, apolipoprotein A-II and calmodulin were found to be decreased in deformed fish. Among the five protein spots that were identified in heat-shocked fish, apolipoprotein A-I-2, apolipoprotein A-II, parvalbumin, myosin light chain 1-1 and nucleoside diphosphate kinase were found to be decreased in deformed larvae. The identification of nine protein spots showing altered expression in deformed fish allows us to reach a preliminary view of the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the development of skeletal malformations in diploid and triploid fish.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6123cf058f610006f76","authors":["Samad Bahrami Babaheydari","Saeed Keyvanshokooh","Salar Dorafshan","Seyed Ali Johari"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cbd.2016.05.001","first_seen_on":"2017-05-19T22:26:49+00:00","issns":["1744117X"],"journal":"Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part D: Genomics and Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1495232796,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27219664?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27219664","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics","biochemistry"],"title":"Proteomic analysis of skeletal deformity in diploid and triploid rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) larvae","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proteomic-analysis-skeletal-deformity-diploid-triploid-rainbow-trout-oncorhynchus-mykiss-larvae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":7121600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233773,"mean":12.34849018702,"rank":190190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233773,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":1.6252352941176,"rank":103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.60625,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CanGovSciPubs\/statuses\/865695209845252096","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20307297],"posted_on":"2017-05-19T22:26:36+00:00","author":{"name":"CanGovSciPubs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/559527025774325760\/Ft_Fm062_normal.png","description":"A bot tweeting new research from the Canadian Government (NRC, AAFC, EC, DFO & NRCan).
