Herein, combination the controllability of the \"bottom-up\" strategy and the stability of multi-arm hyperbranched amphiphiles, we have developed a novel multi-polyprodrug-arm hyperbranched amphiphiles (H40-star-(PHCPTMA-b-PMPC), hPCM) via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization for cancer therapy. The hPCM was constructed via two-step polymerization of an acid-labile prodrug monomer and a zwitterionic monomer, respectively. By using a H40 macroRAFT agent, 10-hydroxycamptothecine (HCPT) prodrug monomers were directly polymerized via the \"bottom-up\" strategy as polyprodrug-arms inner-shell of hPCM with homogeneous drug distribution. The drug loading content can be facile tuned through varying the feed ratio of HCPTMA\/H40 macroRAFT agent. Finally, the poly(zwitterions) hydrophilic outer-shell of hPCM was formed by RAFT polymerization of zwitterionic monomer to ensure the preferable biocompatibility. When dissolving in dilute solution, unimolecular micelles of hPCM can be obtained, which endow a desirable stability for the micelles. The effective cellular internalization, extended blood retention time, considerable accumulation in tumor tissue, and excellent anticancer activity of the hPCM micelles have been evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. This novel multi-polyprodrug-arm hyperbranched amphiphiles constructed via the \"bottom-up\" strategy may open up new horizons for exploring next-generation PDC based drug delivery systems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c4a","authors":["Pei Sun","Dong Chen","Hongping Deng","Nan Wang","Ping Huang","Xin Jin","Xinyuan Zhu"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.bioconjchem.7b00146","first_seen_on":"2017-05-19T18:10:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1043-1802","1520-4812"],"journal":"Bioconjugate Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1495316085,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.bioconjchem.7b00146?hootPostID=e0d67c54f819975b9839c62b7ee4ef61&","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.bioconjchem.7b00146"],"pmid":"28441015","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"\u201cBottom-up\u201d Construction of Multi-Polyprodrug-Arm Hyperbranched Amphiphiles for Cancer Therapy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bottomup-construction-multipolyprodrugarm-hyperbranched-amphiphiles-cancer-therapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":3.2,"6m":3.2,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8243836,"mean":6.9683207276644,"rank":2061315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6166068,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8243836,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236992,"mean":12.228660092577,"rank":75931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":160195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236992,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":808,"mean":2.4665353159851,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":808,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":2.6018518518519,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
