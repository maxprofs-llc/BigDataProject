The resulting open boundaries make half of the bonds on the interfaces inequivalent. By tuning the strength of these inequivalent \"orphan\" bonds, dipolar interactions induce a surface ordering equivalent to a two-dimensional crystallization of magnetic surface charges. This surface ordering may also be expected on the surfaces of bulk crystals. For ultrathin films made of one cubic unit cell, once the surfaces have ordered, a square ice phase is stabilized over a finite temperature window. The square ice degeneracy is lifted at lower temperature and the system orders in analogy with the well-known F transition of the 6-vertex model. To conclude, we consider the addition of strain effects, a possible consequence of interface mismatches at the film-substrate interface. Our simulations qualitatively confirm that strain can lead to a smooth loss of Pauling entropy upon cooling, as observed in recent experiments on Dy_{2}Ti_{2}O_{7} films.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["L.\u2009D.\u2009C.
