A total of 160 normal aging adults and 40 patients with the early stage of probable AD were included. Neuropsychological performance was assessed using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (CERAD-NAB). (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans were used to measure AD-related hypometabolism. Nonparametric Spearman correlation analysis was used to study associations between ECog and z-transformed total CERAD-NAB scores in both groups. The results revealed a significant correlation between total ECog and CERAD-NAB scores (rho\u2009=\u2009-0.28, p\u2009<\u20090.01), and category verbal fluency test with the executive domain of the ECog scale (rho\u2009=\u2009-0.20, p\u2009<\u20090.01). The CERAD-NAB scores were also significantly correlated with AD-related hypometabolism (rho\u2009=\u2009-0.49, p\u2009<\u20090.01). The memory domain of the ECog scale was significantly correlated with FDG uptake in the angular gyrus and posterior cingulum gyrus (rho\u2009=\u2009-0.41 and -0.46, P\u2009<\u20090.01). In conclusion, both total and memory domain ECog scores were correlated with the neuropsychological tests and neuroimaging biomarkers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Jung-Lung Hsu","Wen-Chuin Hsu","Chiung-Chih Chang","Kun-Ju Lin","Ing-Tsung Hsiao","Yen-Chun Fan","Chyi-Huey Bai"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-01193-6","first_seen_on":"2017-05-19T17:16:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1495214137,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28496183"],"pmid":"28496183","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["science"],"title":"Everyday cognition scales are related to cognitive function in the early stage of probable Alzheimer\u2019s disease and FDG-PET findings","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/everyday-cognition-scales-related-cognitive-function-early-stage-probable-alzheimers-disease-fdgpet"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":1196599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6958363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233773,"mean":12.348549432781,"rank":48629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":183271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233773,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35042,"mean":14.821363773865,"rank":8341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":26342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35042,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2943,"mean":17.27084228416,"rank":727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":2190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2943,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"AR":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Everyday cognition scales are related to cognitive function in the early stage of probable Alzheimer's disease and FDG-PET findings.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=30625662729&p=1pl&v=1&x=MCM_1hD3ImtyOXW_rTEajQ","license":"public","citation_ids":[20303620],"posted_on":"2017-05-19T17:15:37+00:00","summary":".
