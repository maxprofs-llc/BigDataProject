Two isoform classes produced by alternative splicing of one gene have been characterized. The smooth muscle, high molecular weight (89-93 kDa), caldesmon isoforms are exclusively found in adult and fully differentiated smooth muscle cells. The non-muscle, low molecular weight (59-63 kDa), caldesmon isoforms are found in non-muscle and in de-differentiated smooth muscle cells. The conserved regions of all isoforms contain caldesmon's properties such as binding to actin, tropomyosin, Ca(2+)-calmodulin, myosin and phospholipids. All isoforms are also very potent inhibitors of the actin-tropomyosin activated myosin MgATPase. Non-muscle and smooth muscle isoforms of caldesmon perform different roles in vivo. This may be reflected by the distinct cellular distribution of these isoform classes. Non-muscle caldesmon is a regulatory factor in the microfilament network and is thus involved in the assembly and stabilization of microfilaments. Smooth muscle caldesmon together with tropomyosin is a mediating factor for Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of smooth muscle contraction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b26","authors":["P A Huber"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T18:33:08+00:00","issns":["1357-2725"],"issue":"8-9","journal":"International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1203540853,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9415999"],"pmid":"9415999","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Caldesmon.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/caldesmon-8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631967,"mean":4.9253635474614,"rank":816050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2293668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631967,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94373,"mean":8.1080981223246,"rank":24535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94373,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":779,"mean":3.3599100257069,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":779,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":1.9982941176471,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Caldesmon","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=192881139#altmetric_citation_1","license":"public","citation_ids":[3405499,3405502],"posted_on":"2008-02-20T20:54:13+00:00","summary":"Caldesmon is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CALD1 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=7357636","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Boghog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Boghog"}}]}}
