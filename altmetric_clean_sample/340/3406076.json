Of the 10 well-differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma cases with heterozygous markers (HUMARA, X-linked androgen receptor gene), 9 had skewed X inactivation consistent with a monoclonal process, and one contained a structurally altered HUMARA gene. X inactivation skewing similar to that of the tumor was seen in matched control polyclonal tissues of 4 (of 9) cases, caused by the small number of endometrial stem cells at the time of embryonic X inactivation. When the polymerase chain reaction assay was applied to four potential endometrial precancers (atypical endometrial hyperplasia) and matched control tissues, two were inconclusive, and two were found to be monoclonal. We conclude that 1) it is essential to include polyclonal control tissues in X inactivation analyses to determine whether skewing is a specific indicator of monoclonality; and 2) endometrial adenocarcinomas and some putative precancers, atypical endometrial hyperplasia, are monoclonal.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006988","authors":["G L Mutter","M L Chaponot","J A Fletcher"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T18:47:25+00:00","issns":["0002-9440"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal of Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1304549490,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7856759","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1869842"],"pmcid":"PMC1869842","pmid":"7856759","pubdate":"1995-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"A polymerase chain reaction assay for non-random X chromosome inactivation identifies monoclonal endometrial cancers and precancers.","type":"article","volume":"146","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polymerase-chain-reaction-assay-nonrandom-x-chromosome-inactivation-identifies-monoclonal-endometria"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628077,"mean":4.9442940120368,"rank":817296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628077,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93765,"mean":8.0609951793866,"rank":24258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93765,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1357,"mean":3.2758053097345,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1357,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":3.8433333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=427485917#altmetric_citation_2","license":"public","citation_ids":[3406076],"posted_on":"2011-05-04T22:51:30+00:00","summary":"Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia, (EIN) is a premalignant lesion of the uterine lining that predisposes to endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=7382821","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"RDBrown","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:RDBrown"}}]}}
