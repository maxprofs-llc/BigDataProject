These data indicated that enzymes of human tissues could activate arylhydroxamic acids by N leads to O acyl transfer. The unstable N-acetoxyarylamines formed by these enzymes reacted spontaneously with the tRNA to give covalently linked adducts with the nucleic acid.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c44","authors":["C M King","C W Olive","R A Cardona"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T19:01:54+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0027-8874"],"issue":"2","journal":"JNCI: Journal of the National Cancer Institute","last_mentioned_on":1284873809,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1159819"],"pmid":"1159819","pubdate":"1975-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Activation of carcinogenic arylhydroxamic acids by human tissues.","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/activation-carcinogenic-arylhydroxamic-acids-human-tissues"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4823280,"mean":5.7592269686273,"rank":1174147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3058549,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4823280,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170763,"mean":8.6610916011761,"rank":50146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":118370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170763,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3096,"mean":9.8446410339257,"rank":1285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":1583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3096,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":15.844173913043,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Palladin","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=385668237#altmetric_citation_11","license":"public","citation_ids":[3406671],"posted_on":"2010-09-19T05:23:29+00:00","summary":"Palladin is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PALLD gene.
