This reaction appears to proceed via 1,6-stannyllithium addition\/elimination of lithium dialkylamide. Several stannyldienals of significant utility for the synthesis of polyene natural products have been made by this route, which proceeds in modest yields, but is successful on multigram scale using inexpensive reagents. Simple stannylenals and stannylenones are similarly available from the corresponding vinylogous amides.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Theo D.
