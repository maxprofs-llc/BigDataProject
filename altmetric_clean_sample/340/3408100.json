The limited trypsin treatment of the PDE removes the low molecular weight gamma subunit (Mr approximately 14,000) of the enzyme, yielding a catalytic moiety comprised of the two larger molecular subunits (alpha, Mr approximately 85,000-90,000; beta, Mr approximately 85,000-90,000), which is insensitive to the addition of either the pure alpha T.GTP gamma S species or the pure beta gamma T subunit complex. However, the addition of the pure alpha T.GDP species to the trypsin-treated PDE (tPDE) results in a significant (90-100%) inhibition of the enzyme activity. This inhibition can be reversed by excess beta gamma T, suggesting that the holotransducin molecule does not (functionally) interact with the tPDE. However, the inhibition by alpha T.GDP is not reversed by the alpha T.GTP gamma S complex, over a range of [alpha T.GTP gamma S] which elicits a marked stimulation of the native enzyme activity, suggesting that the activated alpha T species does not effectively bind to the tPDE. The alpha T.GDP complex also is capable of inhibiting the alpha T.GTP gamma S-stimulated cyclic GMP hydrolysis by the native PDE. This inhibition can be reversed by excess alpha T.GTP gamma S, as well as by beta gamma T, indicating that the binding site for the activated alpha T species is in close proximity and\/or overlaps the binding site for the alpha T.GDP complex on the enzyme. Overall, these results are consistent with a scheme where (a) both the small and larger molecular weight subunits of PDE participate in alpha T-PDE interactions, (b) the activation of PDE by the alpha T.GTP gamma S (or alpha T.GTP) species does not result in the complete dissociation of the gamma subunit from the enzyme, and (c) the deactivation of this signal transduction system results from a direct interaction between the alpha T.GDP species and the catalytic moiety of the effector enzyme.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["S Kroll","W J Phillips","R A Cerione"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T19:39:57+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1324218159,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2538446"],"pmid":"2538446","pubdate":"1989-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The regulation of the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase by the GDP-bound form of the alpha subunit of transducin.","type":"article","volume":"264","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regulation-cyclic-gmp-phosphodiesterase-gdpbound-form-subunit-transducin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4002357,"mean":5.0339744892175,"rank":918947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2531321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4002357,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124741,"mean":9.0062431336083,"rank":37666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":85381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124741,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29109,"mean":2.5171237329485,"rank":1908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":11944,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29109,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":327,"mean":3.573717791411,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":327,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
