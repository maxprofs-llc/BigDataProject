This research also discovered DNA looping and the mechanism by which the regulatory protein changes its DNA-binding properties in response to the presence of arabinose. As is frequently seen in focused research on biological subjects, the initial studies were primarily genetic. Subsequently, the genetic approaches were augmented by physiological and then biochemical studies. Now biophysical studies are being conducted at the atomic level, but genetics still has a crucial role in the study of this system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ad","authors":["R Schleif"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T17:42:22+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0168-9525"],"issue":"12","journal":"Trends in Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1305603405,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11102706"],"pmid":"11102706","pubdate":"2000-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Regulation of the L-arabinose operon of Escherichia coli.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regulation-thearabinose-operon-escherichia-coli"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4549714,"mean":5.3132757583978,"rank":1050929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2930554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4549714,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151549,"mean":8.8112577665164,"rank":44052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":105581,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151549,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":817,"mean":5.7704828431373,"rank":309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":817,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":7.4552631578947,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"L-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=429500742#altmetric_citation_10","license":"public","citation_ids":[3403524,3403529],"posted_on":"2011-05-17T03:36:45+00:00","summary":"This enzyme has a molecular mass of 102 kDa and is believed to be composed of four identical 25.5 kDa subunits.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14216020","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Ryanearlek","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Ryanearlek"}}]}}
