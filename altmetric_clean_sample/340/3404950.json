It is stabilized in its midrange by its limited joint volume and concavity-compression. It is stabilized at the extremes of motion by its ligaments. An enhanced understanding of these stabilizing mechanisms helps us in the diagnosis and management of glenohumeral instability.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005819","authors":["F A Matsen","D T Harryman","J A Sidles"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T18:18:36+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0278-5919"],"issue":"4","journal":"Clinics in Sports Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1328798585,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1934096"],"pmid":"1934096","pubdate":"1991-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Mechanics of glenohumeral instability.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanics-glenohumeral-instability"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626769,"mean":4.9522514062143,"rank":817853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626769,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93443,"mean":8.0078917617346,"rank":24124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93443,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163,"mean":2.4080617283951,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":4.9833333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
