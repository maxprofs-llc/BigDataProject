The rns gene appears to be a reservoir for a number of group I and group II introns along with intron-associated open reading frames such as homing endonucleases and reverse transcriptases. This study uncovered two twintrons, one at position mS917 where a group ID intron encoding a LAGLIDADG ORF invaded another ORF-less group ID intron. Another twintron complex was detected at position mS1247 here a group IIA1 intron invaded the open reading frame embedded within a group IC2 intron. Overall the distribution of the introns does not appear to follow evolutionary lineages suggesting the possibility of rare horizontal gains and frequent losses. Results of this study will make a significant contribution to the understanding of the complexity of the mitochondrial intron landscape, and offer a resource to those annotating mitochondrial genomes. It will also serve as a resource to those that bioprospect for ribozymes and homing endonucleases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002922","authors":["Hafez M","Majer A","Sethuraman J","Rudski SM","Michel F","Hausner G"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fgb.2013.01.005","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T17:23:17+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Fungal Genetics & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1418763442,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23403360"],"pmid":"23403360","pubdate":"2013-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology","genetics"],"title":"The mtDNA rns gene landscape in the Ophiostomatales and other fungal taxa: twintrons introns, and intron-encoded proteins.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mtdna-rns-gene-landscape-ophiostomatales-other-fungal-taxa-twintrons-introns-intronencoded-proteins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4627188,"mean":5.4194875376729,"rank":1076336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2979306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4627188,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154928,"mean":8.8459802616717,"rank":45342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":107612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154928,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":363,"mean":2.3149723756906,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":363,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.4142857142857,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
