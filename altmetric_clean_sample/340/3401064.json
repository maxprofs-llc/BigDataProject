All three genes show a complex temporo-spatial pattern of expression. Since the three proteins are probably mutually interchangeable with regard to function, most of the specificity of each family member seems to be based on a tightly controlled regulation of expression. While RUNX gene expression is driven by two promoters for each gene, the promoter sequence alone does not seem to suffice for a proper expressional control. This review focuses on the available evidence for the existence of such control mechanisms and studies aiming at discovering cis-acting regulatory sequences of the RUNX2 gene.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bc4","authors":["Stock, Michael","Otto, Florian"],"doi":"10.1002\/jcb.20471","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T16:35:41+00:00","issns":["1097-4644"],"journal":"Journal of Cellular Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1194545260,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/jcb.20471","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15838892"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jcb.20471\/pdf","pmid":"15838892","pubdate":"2005-04-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Control of RUNX2 isoform expression: the role of promoters and enhancers.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/control-runx2-isoform-expression-role-promoters-enhancers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619417,"mean":4.9285227185855,"rank":815674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2280042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619417,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92288,"mean":7.1515124123658,"rank":23370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":67846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92288,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":864,"mean":1.8706326767092,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":555,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":864,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":0.93735849056604,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
