The application of two new genomic techniques for HLA-Cw (PCR-SSP phototyping) and HLA-DPB1 (PCR-RLFP) typing confirmed serological results and gave a higher resolution, with more heterozygotes than previously found. High gene frequencies of HLA-A24 (0.80), B51 (0. 21), B61 (0.30), B62 (0.21), Cw*0303 (0.27), Cw*0304 (0.51), DRB1*0401 (0.45), DRB1*1402 (0.24), DQ7 (0.88), DPB1*0201 (0.18), DPB1*0401 (0.40) and DPB1*0402 (0.30) were found. A limited number of alleles were found at all HLA loci. The Ammassallik Eskimos of East Greenland are genetically homogenous with little, if any, admixture with European populations. This contrasts with other Greenlandic populations formerly tested. The pattern of alleles indicates a close genetic relationship with other Eskimo populations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002837","authors":["L Welinder","B Graugaard","M Madsen"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T16:19:04+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0960-7420"],"issue":"2","journal":"European Journal of Immunogenetics","last_mentioned_on":1212771326,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10792425"],"pmid":"10792425","pubdate":"2000-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["genetics","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"HLA antigen and gene frequencies in Eskimos of East Greenland.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hla-antigen-gene-frequencies-eskimos-east-greenland"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629407,"mean":4.9349111287126,"rank":816489,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629407,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93985,"mean":8.0860607975828,"rank":24341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68563,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93985,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":2.8255813953488,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"HLA-DQ8","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=217569377#altmetric_citation_12","license":"public","citation_ids":[3400450,3400453],"posted_on":"2008-06-06T16:55:26+00:00","summary":"HLA-DQ8 (DQ8) is a human leukocyte antigen serotype within the HLA-DQ (DQ) serotype group.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=7649285","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"DOI bot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:DOI bot"}},{"title":"HLA-A9","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=158092195#altmetric_citation_2","license":"public","citation_ids":[3400450,3400453],"posted_on":"2007-09-15T18:13:33+00:00","summary":"HLA-A9 (A9) is a broad antigen HLA-A serotype that recognized the HLA-A23 and HLA-A24 serotypes.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=13279640","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Pdeitiker","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Pdeitiker"}}]}}
