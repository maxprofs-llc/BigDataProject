An estimated 228,000 among adults 47 years or younger and currently living in the United States had a diagnosis of cancer during childhood or adolescence. Here, we review long-term adverse effects of childhood cancer and its treatment with an emphasis on physical performance and health. We also briefly review existing guidelines that may be used to develop appropriate exercise and diet interventions for childhood cancer survivors. We suggest that there is a need for development of evidence-based, risk-based guidelines and interventions for health promotion among long-term childhood cancer survivors, particularly for those whose physical activity limitations interfere with chances for optimizing their bodies' potential in today's society.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003777","authors":["Kirsten K.
