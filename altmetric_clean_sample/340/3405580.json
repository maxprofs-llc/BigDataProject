A logical analysis of the assumed relationships between disease and death provides some insights that allow questioning the taken-for-granted relationship between defined disease\/s and the final common parameter of death. Causalism as a paradigm has taken leave of all advanced sciences. In medicine, it is lingering on for anthropocentric reasons. Natural death does not come to pass because of some (replaceable) missing element, but because the evolution of the individual from womb to tomb has arrived at its final destination. To accept death as a physiologic event is to advance thanatology and to disburden medical colleges and hospitals of a lot of avoidable thinking and doing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002eda","authors":["M L Kothari","L A Mehta","V M Kothari"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T18:35:30+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0022-3859"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Postgraduate Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1212767838,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10855082"],"pmid":"10855082","pubdate":"2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education Systems","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Cause of death--so-called designed event acclimaxing timed happenings.","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cause-deathsocalled-designed-event-acclimaxing-timed-happenings"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636226,"mean":4.921076943263,"rank":816752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295941,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636226,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94915,"mean":8.1486270307859,"rank":24769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94915,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":1.7946837606838,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CA":1,"GB":1,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Dysthanasia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=217556228#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3405580],"posted_on":"2008-06-06T15:57:18+00:00","summary":"In medicine, dysthanasia means &quot;bad death&quot; and is considered a common fault of modern medicine&#58;.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=7361571","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"DOI bot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:DOI bot"}}]}}
