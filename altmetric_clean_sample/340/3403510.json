Over a ten-year period (2003-2013), all patients prospectively diagnosed with a positive REP-529 qPCR result for toxoplasmosis were included. All DNA samples (76 samples from 56 patients) were simultaneously tested using the two qPCR methods (REP-529 and B1). The mean Ct obtained with the B1 qPCR was significantly higher (+4.71 cycles) than that obtained with REP-529 qPCR (p<0.0001). Thirty-one out of 69 extracts (45.6%) positive with REP-529 qPCR were not amplified with the B1 qPCR (relative sensitivity 54.4%, compared to REP-529), yielding false negative results on 15\/28 placentas, 5 cord blood, 2 amniotic fluids, 4 cerebrospinal fluids, 1 aqueous humor, 2 lymph node punctures and 1 abortion product. This defect in sensitivity would have left 20\/56 patients undiagnosed, distributed as follows: 12\/40 congenital toxoplasmosis, 4\/5 cerebral toxoplasmosis, 2\/8 patients with retinochoroiditis, and both patients with chronic lymphadenopathy. This poor performance of B1 qPCR could be related to low parasite loads, since the mean Toxoplasma quantification in extracts with B1 false negative results was 0.4 parasite\/reaction. These results clearly show the superiority of the REP-529 sequence in the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis by PCR suggest that this target should be adopted as part of standardization of the PCR assay.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be9","authors":["Sorya Belaz","Jean-Pierre Gangneux","Peggy Dupretz","Claude Guiguen","Florence Robert-Gangneux"],"doi":"10.1128\/jcm.02900-14","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T17:42:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-660X","0095-1137"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Clinical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1461855563,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25653416?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JCM.02900-14"],"pmid":"25653416","pubdate":"2015-02-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"A 10-year retrospective comparison of two target sequences, REP-529 and B1, for Toxoplasma gondii detection by quantitative PCR.","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/10year-retrospective-comparison-two-target-sequences-rep529-b1-toxoplasma-gondii-detection-quantitat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7621460,"mean":6.5607387299425,"rank":805696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":6805404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7621460,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235647,"mean":8.084042512922,"rank":32354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":202798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235647,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4091,"mean":4.3392454767726,"rank":251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":3837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4091,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":3.0366930693069,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
