The synthesis utilized an enantioselective hetero-Diels-Alder reaction which sets three chiral centers in compound 11. The synthesis also features a modified Wolff-Kishner reduction, Rubottom oxidation, and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling to furnish brevisamide.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Arun K.
