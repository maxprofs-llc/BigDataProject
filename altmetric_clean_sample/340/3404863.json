More recent studies have shown that CEH is the same protein as hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and that CEH\/HSL activity may be regulated by phosphorylation. However, the possibility that CEH\/HSL activity may be under transcriptional and\/or translation control has not been excluded. Therefore, in the present study we examined whether PGF2 alpha treatment, APX, or inhibition of PRL secretion by bromocryptine (BrC) treatment modulated CEH\/HSL mRNA and\/or protein levels in a coordinate fashion with CEH activity. Furthermore, we examined whether CEH\/HSL mRNA and\/or protein levels changed after luteinization of the ovary and after natural functional regression. PGF2 alpha treatment and APX significantly reduced CEH activity; and PGF2 alpha treatment, APX, and BrC treatment significantly reduced CEH\/HSL protein and mRNA levels. PRL replacement after APX substantially blocked the reductions in CEH activity, CEH\/HSL protein, and CEH\/HSL mRNA levels. PRL replacement during BrC treatment significantly inhibited the reductions in CEH\/HSL protein and mRNA levels. CEH\/HSL mRNA levels increased twofold after luteinization. Whereas CEH\/HSL mRNA levels remained elevated after natural luteal regression, CEH\/HSL protein significantly decreased. In summary, the luteolytic actions of PGF2 alpha, APX, and BrC resulted in coordinate reductions in luteal CEH activity, protein levels, and mRNA levels; PRL replacement significantly reversed the luteolytic effects of APX and BrC; natural luteal regression resulted in a reduction in CEH\/HSL protein without a concomitant reduction in CEH\/HSL mRNA. These results suggest that ovarian CEH activity is controlled at the level of both transcription and translation, and that PRL is important for continued CEH\/HSL mRNA transcription in the CL.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c6e","authors":["R F Aten","T R Kolodecik","G J Macdonald","H R Behrman","Aten, R F","Kolodecik, T R","Macdonald, G J","Behrman, H R"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T18:16:41+00:00","issns":["0006-3363"],"issue":"5","journal":"Biology of Reproduction","last_mentioned_on":1317678525,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8527515"],"pmid":"8527515","pubdate":"1995-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Modulation of cholesteryl ester hydrolase messenger ribonucleic acid levels, protein levels, and activity in the rat corpus luteum.","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modulation-cholesteryl-ester-hydrolase-messenger-ribonucleic-acid-levels-protein-levels-activity-rat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629536,"mean":4.93415564694,"rank":816426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629536,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94010,"mean":8.0872790264764,"rank":24352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94010,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1447,"mean":2.1904840940526,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":1087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1447,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.01,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
