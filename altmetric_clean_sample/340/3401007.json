Maximum HLA heterozygosity of class I loci (A, B, and C) delayed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) onset among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1), whereas individuals who were homozygous for one or more loci progressed rapidly to AIDS and death. The HLA class I alleles B*35 and Cw*04 were consistently associated with rapid development of AIDS-defining conditions in Caucasians. The extended survival of 28 to 40 percent of HIV-1-infected Caucasian patients who avoided AIDS for ten or more years can be attributed to their being fully heterozygous at HLA class I loci, to their lacking the AIDS-associated alleles B*35 and Cw*04, or to both.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["M Carrington","G W Nelson","M P Martin","T Kissner","D Vlahov","J J Goedert","R Kaslow","S Buchbinder","K Hoots","S J O'Brien"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T16:33:50+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0036-8075"],"issue":"5408","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1387298879,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10073943"],"pmid":"10073943","pubdate":"1999-03-12T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"HLA and HIV-1: heterozygote advantage and B*35-Cw*04 disadvantage.","type":"article","volume":"283","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hla-hiv1-heterozygote-advantage-b35cw04-disadvantage"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627006,"mean":4.9509722374284,"rank":817809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627006,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93494,"mean":8.0090861347909,"rank":24148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93494,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27850,"mean":21.083348271033,"rank":15051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":7245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27850,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":493,"mean":91.513182926829,"rank":431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":493,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":16,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":39,"Student  > Ph.
