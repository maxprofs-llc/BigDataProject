The structure of 1 was elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic and 2D-NMR spectral analysis. In addition, 1 exhibited mild inhibitory effect on NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006afe","authors":["Gang Chen","Hui Zi Jin","Xue Feng Li","Qi Zhang","Yun Heng Shen","Shi Kai Yan","Wei Dong Zhang"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12272-001-1253-y","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T16:44:32+00:00","issns":["1976-3786"],"journal":"Archives of Pharmacal Research","last_mentioned_on":1352722770,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s12272-001-1253-y"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12272-001-1253-y.pdf","pmid":"18787782","pubdate":"2008-09-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Pharmaceutical Society of Korea","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacy","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"A new chromone glycoside from Rhododendron spinuliferum","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-chromone-glycoside-rhododendron-spinuliferum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":816907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93889,"mean":8.0741739732449,"rank":24309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93889,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226,"mean":1.6644622222222,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.98125,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
