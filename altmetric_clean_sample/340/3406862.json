DNA ISCs were formed rapidly (peak 6-12 h) following a 2 h exposure to 50 microM BCNU or 25 uM cis-DDP, and on an equimolar basis higher levels of crosslinking were observed with cis-DDP than with BCNU. Repair of cis-DDP induced crosslinks was characteristically bi-phasic and the rate was significantly higher than that for BCNU induced crosslinks. Overall, a low crosslink index and a high crosslink repair rate correlated with cis-DDP and BCNU resistance. The data demonstrate, conclusively, the ability of human glioma cells to repair cis-DDP and, for the first time, BCNU induced DNA ISCs and that DNA crosslink repair is a significant contributing factor to the resistance of these tumors to the two agents.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000cfbe","authors":["F Ali-Osman","A Rairkar","P Young","Ali-Osman, F","Rairkar, A","Young, P"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T19:07:25+00:00","issns":["0305-7232"],"issue":"4","journal":"Cancer biochemistry biophysics","last_mentioned_on":1233236823,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7767897"],"pmid":"7767897","pubdate":"1995-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms","biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Formation and repair of 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea and cisplatin induced total genomic DNA interstrand crosslinks in human glioma cells.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/formation-repair-13bis2chloroethyl1nitrosourea-cisplatin-induced-total-genomic-dna-interstrand-cross"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633792,"mean":4.9212574058383,"rank":815862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295763,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633792,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94628,"mean":8.1425314762174,"rank":24637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94628,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":6.0833333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
