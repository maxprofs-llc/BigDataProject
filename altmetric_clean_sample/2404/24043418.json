Due to decreasing budgets and increasing costs of preclinical research, alternatives are sought with high translatability and low cost. Here we demonstrate the utility of a zebrafish-based model of nociception to serve as a novel screening tool for analgesic drugs. Zebrafish swimming behavior was measured following administration of various algogens including histamine, cinnamaldehyde, mustard oil, acetic acid and complete Freund's adjuvant. All compounds reduce distance traveled, thought to be an expression of nociception. Additionally, the suppression of swimming was attenuated by administration of the common analgesic, morphine. Together these data provide support for the use of zebrafish as a cost-effective and translatable model of nociception.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003325","authors":["J.
