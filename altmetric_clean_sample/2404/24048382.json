Here, we sought to synthesize corylifol A glucosides by the in\u00a0vitro glucosylation reaction using the UDP-glycosyltransferase YjiC from Bacillus licheniformis DSM 13, and obtained two novel glucosides: corylifol A-4',7-di-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside (1) and corylifol A-4'-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside (2). To improve the yield of the products, the reaction time, concentration of UDP-glucose, and pH of the buffer were optimized. The Michaelis constant (Km) was calculated to be 2.88\u00a0mM, and the maximal velocity (Vmax) was calculated to be 77.32\u00a0nmol\/min\/mg for UDP-glycosyltransferase. Meanwhile, the water-solubility of compounds 1 and 2 was approximately 27.03 and 15.13 times higher, respectively, than that of their parent compound corylifol A. Additionally, the corylifol A glycosylated products exhibited the highest stability at pH 9.6 and better temperature stability than corylifol A at 40, 60, 80 and 100\u00a0\u00b0C. In addition, cytotoxicity activity assays against three human tumor cell lines, only corylifol A showed moderate anti-proliferative activity. Overall, this work demonstrates that glycosylation can enhance the water solubility and stability of promising compounds, with potential for further development and application.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024a5","authors":["Nan Li","Jian Miao","Jing Li","Yu-Ru Zhao","Hong-Mei Li","Yi-Qun Dai","Qiang Huo","Cheng-Zhu Wu","Tao Ma"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.carres.2017.05.002","first_seen_on":"2017-08-18T21:39:56+00:00","issns":["00086215"],"journal":"Carbohydrate Research","last_mentioned_on":1494929879,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0008621516305390&_version=1&md5=4b9dd6447b4f7f7f25c46ba94ecb5820"],"pmid":"28528234","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","biochemistry"],"title":"Enzymatic synthesis of novel corylifol A glucosides via a UDP-glycosyltransferase","type":"article","volume":"446-447"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":1.85,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8242315,"mean":6.9690880509948,"rank":3687698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4463875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8242315,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94390,"mean":11.569281484071,"rank":38077,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":54847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94390,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":488,"mean":2.526681724846,"rank":232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":488,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.25,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CarbohydrateRes\/statuses\/862922174750875648","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24048382],"posted_on":"2017-05-12T06:47:33+00:00","author":{"name":"CarbohydrateResearch","url":"https:\/\/www.journals.elsevier.com\/carbohydrate-research","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/887949796144709632\/O-AErXo1_normal.jpg","description":"Unofficial Carbohydrate Research account.
