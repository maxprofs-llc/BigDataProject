Since the pathogenesis remains unclear, therapeutic approaches in general comprise unspecific immunosuppression strategies that have been met with limited success. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms is critically required to assist in development of targeted therapies. Animal models have proven to be tremendously helpful in mechanistic studies and allow researchers to overcome the inevitable restrictions of human research. Although the number of different IIM models has drastically increased over the last few decades, a model that exhibits the phenotypical and histopathological hallmarks of IIM is still missing. Recent publications have shown promising results addressing different pathophysiological issues like mechanisms of onset, chronification or relapse in IIM. However, a standardization of the methodology is critically required in order to improve comparability and transferability among different groups. Here we provide an overview of the currently available IIM models including our own C-peptide based small-peptide model, critically discuss their advantages and disadvantages and give perspectives to their future use.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000237e","authors":["Ali Maisam Afzali","Tobias Ruck","Heinz Wiendl","Sven G.
