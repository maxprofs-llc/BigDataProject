This structural change was reversible, and the deformation of the porphyrin J-aggregates caused reconstruction of the liposomes from the tubes. We discussed the tubulation mechanism and calculated the force provided by porphyrin J-aggregates for tubulation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e2","authors":["Kouta Sugikawa","Yutaro Takamatsu","Tomoyuki Kakigi","Kazuma Yasuhara","Atsushi Ikeda"],"doi":"10.1039\/c7cc05857h","first_seen_on":"2017-08-18T19:07:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1359-7345","1364-548X"],"journal":"Chemical Communications","last_mentioned_on":1503083251,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2017\/CC\/C7CC05857H"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2017\/cc\/c7cc05857h","pmid":"28848982","pubdate":"2017-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Tubulation of Liposomes via the Interaction of Supramolecular Nanofibers","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":7254271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165505,"mean":12.796301092421,"rank":135686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165505,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5995,"mean":3.0431581581582,"rank":4814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5995,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197,"mean":2.2956530612245,"rank":151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SerpellLabReads\/statuses\/898622404934508544","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24043445],"posted_on":"2017-08-18T19:07:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Serpell Lab Reads","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/791203225663836160\/aINmwGDJ_normal.jpg","description":"Supramolecular, nano, biomolecular, polymer, materials highlights.
