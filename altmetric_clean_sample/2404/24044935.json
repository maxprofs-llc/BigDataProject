The mechanisms leading to the disorganized nerve proliferation are not completely understood, though inflammation in the injured nerve vicinity most likely has a role in the process. Inflammatory cytokines are also known to be involved in the maintenance and development of post-traumatic and neuropathic pain. The goal of this study was to quantify and compare pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10) levels in nerves that formed neuromas and nerves that did not, following sciatic nerve transection. A total of 30 rats were used in this study. Twenty rats underwent sciatic nerve transection and 10 underwent sham surgery. Six weeks post-surgery nerve sections were collected and histologically evaluated for neuroma formation. The samples were then classified as neuroma, non-neuroma and sham groups. TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were measured in the nerves employing ELISA. TNF-\u03b1 levels were significantly higher in both neuroma and non-neuroma-forming injured nerves compared to the sham group. IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 levels were significantly higher in the neuroma-forming nerves compared to the sham group. IL-10 levels were significantly higher in the non-neuroma group compared to the sham group. In conclusion IL-6, and IL-1 \u03b2 may have a role in the formation of traumatic neuroma while IL-10 may inhibit neuroma formation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f61000329f","authors":["Junad Khan","Noma Noboru","Andrew Young","Davis Thomas"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pathophys.2017.04.001","first_seen_on":"2017-08-18T19:44:50+00:00","issns":["09284680"],"journal":"Pathophysiology","last_mentioned_on":1491941016,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0928468016301031&_version=1&md5=0f8d009a986b477786bb9afcb632c95f"],"pmid":"28462800","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Pro and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10) in rat model of neuroma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pro-antiinflammatory-cytokine-levels-tnf%CE%B1-il1%CE%B2-il6-il10-rat-model-neuroma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8240740,"mean":6.9693285920043,"rank":6254607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1111740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8240740,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94009,"mean":11.581089354098,"rank":66069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":17387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94009,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":10.241676470588,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/REAvsCDC\/statuses\/851888482830176256","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24044935],"posted_on":"2017-04-11T20:03:36+00:00","author":{"name":"CureTheCDC","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/REAvsCDC\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/745018458908196864\/oJfuofaN_normal.jpg","description":"Please Support #CureTheCDC or join as a Co-plaintiff.E-mail a brief statement of grievances to CureTheCDC@gmail.com","id_on_source":"REAvsCDC","tweeter_id":"712134955996807169","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":372},"tweet_id":"851888482830176256"}]}}
