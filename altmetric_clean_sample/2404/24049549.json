For this MEMRI application, manganese solutions are usually directly injected into specific brain regions. Recently it was reported that manganese ions can diffuse through intact rat skull. Here the local manganese concentrations in the brain tissue after transcranial manganese application were quantified and the effectiveness of tracing from the area under the skull where delivery occurred was determined. It was established that transcranially applied manganese yields brain tissue enhancement dependent on the location of application on the skull and that manganese that enters the brain transcranially can trace to deeper brain areas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003196","authors":["Tatjana Atanasijevic","Nadia Bouraoud","Dorian B.
