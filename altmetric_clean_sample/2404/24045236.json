Yet physiological traits are important for explaining and predicting interactions at higher levels of organization. We investigated the single and combined impact of the pesticide chlorpyrifos, predation risk and warming on endpoints related to oxidative stress in the damselfly Enallagma cyathigerum. We thereby integrated information on reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant enzymes and oxidative damage. All three treatments impacted the oxidative stress levels and for most traits the pesticide interacted antagonistically with warming or predation risk. Chlorpyrifos exposure resulted in increased ROS levels, decreased antioxidant defence and increased oxidative damage compared to the control situation. Under warming, the pesticide-induced increase in oxidative stress was less strong and the investment in antioxidant defence higher. Although both the pesticide and predation risk increased oxidative damage, the effects of the pesticide on oxidative damage were less strong in the presence of predator cues (at 20\u00a0\u00b0C). Despite the weaker pesticide-induced effects under predation risk, the combination of the pesticide and predator cues consistently caused the highest ROS levels, the lowest antioxidant defence and the highest oxidative damage, indicating the importance of cumulative stressor effects for impairing fitness. Our results provide the first evidence for antagonistic interactions of warming and predation risk with a pollutant for physiological traits. We identified two general mechanisms that may generate antagonistic interactions for oxidative stress: cross-tolerance and the maximum cumulative levels of damage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006534","authors":["Lizanne Janssens","Robby Stoks"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.envpol.2017.04.012","first_seen_on":"2017-08-18T19:52:06+00:00","issns":["02697491"],"journal":"Environmental Pollution","last_mentioned_on":1492083996,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0269749116324770&_version=1&md5=2455e8df9805727ebcff3e6b7000f0bb"],"pmid":"28411497","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Chlorpyrifos-induced oxidative damage is reduced under warming and predation risk: Explaining antagonistic interactions with a pesticide","type":"article","volume":"226","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chlorpyrifosinduced-oxidative-damage-reduced-under-warming-predation-risk-explaining-antagonistic-in"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":1.1,"6m":1.1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8240740,"mean":6.9693285920043,"rank":4353087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3859997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8240740,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94021,"mean":11.581852244203,"rank":50012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":43350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94021,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2314,"mean":6.4984133160398,"rank":1323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2314,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":13.14787012987,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
