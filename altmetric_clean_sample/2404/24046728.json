Linear fit combination (LCF) analysis of the experimental spectra compared to a large set of reference compounds showed that all spectra can be fitted by only four species: \u03b2-HgS (metacinnabar), Hg-cysteine, Hg bound to tannic acid, and Hg(0). The first two are more widespread, whereas the last two occur in one sample only; the contribution of organic species is higher in deeper layers of barks than in the outermost ones. We interpret these results to suggest that, during interaction of barks with airborne Hg, the metal is initially mechanically captured at the bark surface as particulate, or physically adsorbed as gaseous species, but eventually a stable chemical bond is established with organic ligands of the substrate. As a consequence, we suggest that deep bark Hg may be a good proxy for long term time-integrated exposure, while surface bark Hg is more important for recording short term events near Hg point sources.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006534","authors":["Laura Chiarantini","Valentina Rimondi","Fabrizio Bardelli","Marco Benvenuti","Claudia Cosio","Pilario Costagliola","Francesco Di Benedetto","Pierfranco Lattanzi","G\u00e9raldine Sarret"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.envpol.2017.04.038","first_seen_on":"2017-08-18T20:41:48+00:00","issns":["02697491"],"journal":"Environmental Pollution","last_mentioned_on":1493434692,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0269749117307649&_version=1&md5=28d6f4a14add97d1c44b4f80289371a3"],"pmid":"28458249","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Mercury speciation in Pinus nigra barks from Monte Amiata (Italy): An X-ray absorption spectroscopy study","type":"article","volume":"227","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mercury-speciation-pinus-nigra-barks-monte-amiata-italy-xray-absorption-spectroscopy-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8241602,"mean":6.9693594098944,"rank":7129740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8241602,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94169,"mean":11.58131857956,"rank":76736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94169,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2314,"mean":6.4984133160398,"rank":1815,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2314,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":12.376658536585,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1,"Environmental Science":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ecotoxicology\/statuses\/858153414034956288","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24046728],"posted_on":"2017-04-29T02:58:12+00:00","author":{"name":"ecotoxicology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/499652563751280642\/9Yw-u5dW_normal.png","description":"Ecotoxicology and Environmental Pollution  Publications Feed.
