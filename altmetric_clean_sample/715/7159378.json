The potential of TS was compared with ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA), which is used as a common chemical agent to enhance uptake of cadmium (Cd) by Amaranthus caudatus, an ornamental plant in the natural vegetation of Turkey under pot conditions. The enrichment coefficient (EC) and translocation factor (TF) values were calculated to evaluate the removal efficiency of the TS and EDTA. The results showed that an increase in both TS and EDTA concentration significantly increased Cd uptake by A. caudatus, accumulating Cd in different parts of the plant. Higher EC and TF values obtained from stems, leaves, and inflorescences of A. caudatus showed that this plant might be cultivated and used as a hyperaccumulator in the uptake of Cd from the Cd contaminated soils. Thus, the present technique can efficiently reduce the metal load in the food chain; hence, it could be applied in catchment areas of urban cities where Cd contamination has become an unavoidable factor.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006531","authors":["Cay, Seydahmet"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10661-016-5334-z","first_seen_on":"2016-05-05T13:04:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-2959","0167-6369"],"issue":"6","journal":"Environmental Monitoring & Assessment","last_mentioned_on":1462453384,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27142816?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27142816","pubdate":"2016-05-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atmospheric Protection\/Air Quality Control\/Air Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecotoxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Management","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Monitoring\/Analysis","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Enhancement of cadmium uptake by Amaranthus caudatus, an ornamental plant, using tea saponin","type":"article","volume":"188","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enhancement-cadmium-uptake-amaranthus-caudatus-ornamental-plant-using-tea-saponin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7657182,"mean":6.5797688551388,"rank":6626072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7657182,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266428,"mean":11.383722430534,"rank":223004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266428,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":845,"mean":2.7011587677725,"rank":668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":845,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":1.9086956521739,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/plant_biology\/statuses\/728208392964050944","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7159378],"posted_on":"2016-05-05T13:03:04+00:00","author":{"name":"plantbio","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"plant_biology","tweeter_id":"3182517054","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":106},"tweet_id":"728208392964050944"}]}}
