Biomarkers in saliva (e.g., enzymes, protein markers, or oxidative stress markers) can be used for activity determination and for periodontal disease prognosis. Saliva also contains many markers which can predict the risk of certain diseases (e.g., diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular, oncology, endocrinology, and psychiatric diseases). The study of salivary components proteomics clearly shows the relationship of periodontal diseases and diseases of distant systems, organs, or tissues.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000271d","authors":["Podzimek, Stepan","Vondrackova, Lucie","Duskova, Jana","Janatova, Tatjana","Broukal, Zdenek"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/9179632","endpage":"8","first_seen_on":"2016-05-05T11:45:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1875-8630","0278-0240"],"journal":"Disease Markers","last_mentioned_on":1462448454,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27143814?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27143814","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Salivary Markers for Periodontal and General Diseases","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/salivary-markers-periodontal-general-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7657182,"mean":6.5797688551388,"rank":6626069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7657182,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266429,"mean":11.383688148392,"rank":223002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266429,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":347,"mean":2.304063583815,"rank":249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":347,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.375,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
