In spite of great progress in controlling the disease, it is still one of the most serious parasitic diseases in the country. The study and use of diagnostic techniques play an important role in the targeting of chemotherapy that has been continuously applied in the national schistosomiasis control programme for several decades. This paper reviews the development and application of parasitological, immunodiagnostic and molecular diagnostic technology for S. japonicum in The People's Republic of China with a brief mention of diagnostic imagery, such as ultrasound and radiology. When analysing the efficacy and performance characteristics of the main diagnostic techniques in current use, it becomes apparent that approaches that worked well in the past are less suitable now as successful control has shifted the endemic situation towards control and interruption of transmission. The conclusion is that a mutable approach must be adopted choosing the most appropriate diagnostic technique for each control stage (and area), thus modifying the methodology according to the prevailing diagnostic needs in terms of sensitivity and specificity.","aggregated_in":[9953330],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002192","authors":["Zhang, J-F","Xu, J","Bergquist, R","Yu, L-L","Yan, X-L","Zhu, H-Q","Wen, L-Y","J.-F.
