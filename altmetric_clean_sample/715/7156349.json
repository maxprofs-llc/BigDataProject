The progress of leaf senescence is controlled by various environmental cues and plant hormones, including ethylene, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, abscisic acid, cytokinins, and strigolactones. The production of strigolactones is induced in response to nitrogen and phosphorous deficiency. Strigolactones also accelerate leaf senescence and regulate shoot branching and root architecture. Leaf senescence is actively promoted in a nutrient-poor soil environment, and nutrients are transported from old leaves to young tissues and seeds. Strigolactones might act as important signals in response to nutrient levels in the rhizosphere. In this review, we discuss the possible roles of strigolactones during leaf senescence.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef752a83ee09648b51dd","authors":["Yamada, Yusuke","Umehara, Mikihisa"],"doi":"10.3390\/plants4030664","endpage":"677","first_seen_on":"2016-05-05T10:10:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2223-7747"],"issue":"3","journal":"Plants","last_mentioned_on":1462442882,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27135345?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27135345","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"664","title":"Possible Roles of Strigolactones during Leaf Senescence","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/possible-roles-strigolactones-during-leaf-senescence"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7657182,"mean":6.5797688551388,"rank":5791844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1031136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7657182,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266429,"mean":11.383720051946,"rank":186669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266429,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.4737142857143,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.016,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
