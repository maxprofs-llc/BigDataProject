Molecular studies have revealed several new Mycobacteria species that are closely related to M. intracellulare. The aim of this study was to re-identify and characterize clinical isolates from patients previously diagnosed with M. intracellulare lung disease at the molecular level.\nMycobacterial isolates from 77 patients, initially diagnosed with M. intracellulare lung disease were re-analyzed by multi-locus sequencing and pattern of insertion sequences.\nAmong the 77 isolates, 74 (96\u00a0%) isolates were designated as M. intracellulare based on multigene sequence-based analysis. Interestingly, the three remaining strains (4\u00a0%) were re-identified as \"Mycobacterium indicus pranii\" according to distinct molecular phylogenetic positions in rpoB and hsp65 sequence-based typing. In hsp65 sequevar analysis, code 13 was found in the majority of cases and three unreported codes were identified. In 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequevar analysis, all isolates of both species were classified within the Min-A ITS sequevar. Interestingly, four of the M. intracellulare isolates harbored IS1311, a M. avium-specific element. Two of three patients infected with \"M. indicus pranii\" had persistent positive sputum cultures after antibiotic therapy, indicating the clinical relevance of this study.\nThis analysis highlights the importance of precise identification of clinical isolates genetically close to Mycobacterium species, and suggests that greater attention should be paid to nontuberculous mycobacteria lung disease caused by \"M. indicus pranii\".","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","authors":["Kim, Su-Young","Park, Hye Yun","Jeong, Byeong-Ho","Jeon, Kyeongman","Huh, Hee Jae","Ki, Chang-Seok","Lee, Nam Yong","Han, Seung-Jung","Shin, Sung Jae","Koh, Won-Jung"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12879-015-1140-4","first_seen_on":"2016-05-05T10:30:50+00:00","issns":["1471-2334"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1462444206,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26423052?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26423052","pubdate":"2015-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tropical Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Molecular analysis of clinical isolates previously diagnosed as Mycobacterium intracellulare reveals incidental findings of \u201cMycobacterium indicus pranii\u201d genotypes in human lung infection","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-analysis-clinical-isolates-previously-diagnosed-mycobacterium-intracellulare-reveals-incid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7657182,"mean":6.5797688551388,"rank":5791850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1031141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7657182,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266429,"mean":11.383713671235,"rank":186670,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266429,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3448,"mean":3.7045430809399,"rank":2522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3448,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156,"mean":3.8199741935484,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
