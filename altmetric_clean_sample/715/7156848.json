Adherence to these guidelines involves many steps from both clinicians and patients but has not been well studied.\nIn a health care setting with a nodule tracking system, we evaluated the association of communication processes and distress with patient and clinician adherence to recommended follow up and Fleischner Society guidelines, respectively.\nWe conducted a prospective, longitudinally assessed, cohort study of patients with incidentally detected nodules who received care at one Veterans Affairs Medical Center. We measured patient-centered communication with the Consultation Care Measure and distress with the Impact of Event Scale. We abstracted data regarding participant adherence to clinician recommendations (defined as receiving the follow-up scan within 30 d of the recommended date) and clinician adherence to Fleischner guidelines (defined as planning the follow-up scan within 30 d of the recommended interval) from the electronic medical record. We measured associations of communication and distress with adherence using multivariable-adjusted generalized estimating equations.\nAmong 138 veterans, 39% were nonadherent at least once during follow up. Clinicians were nonadherent to Fleischner guidelines for 27% of follow-up scans. High-quality communication (adjusted odds ratio, 3.65; P\u2009=\u20090.02) and distress (adjusted odds ratio, 0.38; P\u2009=\u20090.02) were associated with increased and decreased participant adherence, respectively. Neither was associated with clinician adherence.\nPatients and clinicians often do not adhere to nodule follow-up recommendations. Interventions designed to improve communication quality and decrease distress may also improve patient adherence to nodule follow-up recommendations.","altmetric_jid":"56f0022b2a83ee4d548b4567","authors":["Moseson, Erika M","Wiener, Renda Soylemez","Golden, Sara E","Au, David H","Gorman, John D","Laing, Amber D","Deffebach, Mark E","Slatore, Christopher G","Erika M.
