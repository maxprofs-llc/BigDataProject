At half-filling the system can be tuned from decoupled one-dimensional chains to a two-dimensional solid phase with alternating density order by adjusting the anisotropic coupling. At intermediate anisotropy, however, frustration effects dominate and an incommensurate supersolid phase emerges, which is characterized by incommensurate density order as well as an anisotropic superfluid density. We demonstrate that this intermediate phase results from the proliferation of topological defects in the form of quantum bosonic domain walls. Accordingly, the structure factor has peaks at wave vectors, which are linearly related to the number of domain walls in a finite system in agreement with extensive quantum Monte\u00a0Carlo simulations. We discuss possible connections with the supersolid behavior in the high-temperature superconducting striped phase.","altmetric_jid":"arxiv","arxiv_id":"1605.01237","authors":["Xue-Feng Zhang","Shijie Hu","Axel Pelster","Sebastian Eggert","Xue-Feng Zhang (\ufeff\u5f20\u5b66\u950b","Shijie Hu (\u80e1\u65f6\u6770"],"doi":"10.1103\/physrevlett.117.193201","first_seen_on":"2016-05-05T00:49:27+00:00","issns":["1079-7114","0031-9007"],"issue":"19","journal":"arXiv","last_mentioned_on":1483955348,"links":["http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1605.01237","https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1605.01237","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.117.193201"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1605.01237v1","pmid":"27858459","pubdate":"2016-05-04T11:52:54+00:00","publisher":"American Physical Society","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Quantum domain walls induce incommensurate supersolid phase on the\n  anisotropic triangular lattice","type":"article","volume":"117","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantum-domain-walls-induce-incommensurate-supersolid-phase-anisotropic-triangular-lattice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8327292,"mean":7.0168417111804,"rank":4436384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2317962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8327292,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271254,"mean":11.554124835485,"rank":147147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":98121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271254,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":466495,"mean":2.7889268972378,"rank":149285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":276243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":466495,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25486,"mean":3.4993772807534,"rank":10084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":12849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25486,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
