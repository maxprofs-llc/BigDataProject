We aimed to investigate its impact on metabolic, hormonal, and immune profiles of women with reproductive failures.\nA retrospective study was carried out in 208 women with a history of reproductive failure. Study patients were divided into three groups: women with repeated implantation failure (RIF, n\u00a0=\u00a040), recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL, n\u00a0=\u00a0113), and both RIF and RPL (n\u00a0=\u00a055). Fertile controls were 92.\nPAI-1 4G\/4G was prevalent in RPL, RIF, and RIF\/RPL groups when compared with controls (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and associated with increased risks of RIF, RPL, and RIF with RPL (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.5, 2.2 and 2.7). Women with PAI-1 4G\/4G have significantly higher BMI, glucose, and PAI-1 levels and lower NK cytotoxicity when compared with women without PAI-1 4G\/4G.\nPAI-1 4G\/5G polymorphism plays a major role in the pathogenesis of RPL and RIF by altering metabolic and immunological profiles.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221b","authors":["Salazar Garcia, Maria D","Sung, Nayoung","Mullenix, Thomas M","Dambaeva, Svetlana","Beaman, Kenneth","Gilman-Sachs, Alice","Kwak-Kim, Joanne"],"doi":"10.1111\/aji.12516","first_seen_on":"2016-05-05T10:09:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1600-0897"],"journal":"American Journal of Reproductive Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1462442805,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27145077?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27145077","pubdate":"2016-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 4G\/5G Polymorphism is Associated with Reproductive Failure: Metabolic, Hormonal, and Immune Profiles","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plasminogen-activator-inhibitor1-4g5g-polymorphism-associated-reproductive-failure-metabolic-hormona"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7657182,"mean":6.5797688551388,"rank":6626068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7657182,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266428,"mean":11.383762779298,"rank":223003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266428,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":513,"mean":4.01560546875,"rank":384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":513,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.3428571428571,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
