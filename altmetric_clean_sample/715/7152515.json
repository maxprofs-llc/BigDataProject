FR37-CMT cell line has a stellate or fusiform shape, displays the ability to reorganize the collagen matrix, expresses vimentin, CD44 and shows the loss of E-cadherin which is considered a fundamental event in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). The up-regulation of ZEB1, the detection of phosphorylated ERK1\/2 and the downregulation of DICER1 and miR-200c are also in accordance with the mesenchymal characteristics of FR37-CMT cell line. FR37-CMT shows a higher resistance to cisplatin (IC50 >50\u2009\u00b5M) and to doxorubicin (IC50 >5.3\u2009\u00b5M) compared with other CMT cell lines. These results support the use of FR37-CMT as a new CMT model that may assist the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying EMT, CMT drug resistance, fostering the development of novel therapies targeting CMT.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036f6","authors":["Raposo, L.
