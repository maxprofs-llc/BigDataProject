Phosphorus (P) starvation induces the accumulation of TAGs, and the cells under P starvation maintain growth through photosynthesis. We recently reported that P starvation-dependent overexpression of type-2 diacylglycerol acyl-CoA acyltransferase (CrDGTT4) from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using a sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol synthase 2 (SQD2) promoter, which has increased activity during P starvation, enhances TAG accumulation in C. reinhardtii cells. As a result, the content of C18:1 fatty acid, a preferred substrate of CrDGTT4, is increased in TAGs. Here we isolated genes encoding SQD2 from strain NIES-2145 of the eustigmatophyte Nannochloropsis and showed that their expression, like that in C. reinhardtii, was up-regulated during P starvation. To enhance oil accumulation under P starvation, we transformed pCrSQD2-CrDGTT4 into Nannochloropsis strain NIES-2145. The transformants had a fatty acid composition that was more similar to that of C. reinhardtii, which resulted in enhanced TAG accumulation and higher 18:1(9) content. The results indicated that the P starvation-inducible promoter of C. reinhardtii was able to drive expression of the CrDGTT4 gene in Nannochloropsis strain NIES-2145 under P starvation. We conclude that the heterologous CrSQD2 promoter is effective in manipulating TAG synthesis in Nannochloropsis during P starvation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc10","authors":["Iwai, Masako","Hori, Koichi","Sasaki-Sekimoto, Yuko","Shimojima, Mie","Ohta, Hiroyuki"],"doi":"10.3389\/fmicb.2015.00912","first_seen_on":"2015-09-07T08:57:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-302X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1442485404,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fmicb.2015.00912\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3389\/fmicb.2015.00912"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fmicb.2015.00912\/pdf","pmid":"26441858","pubdate":"2015-09-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Manipulation of oil synthesis in Nannochloropsis strain NIES-2145 with a phosphorus starvation\u2013inducible promoter from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/manipulation-oil-synthesis-nannochloropsis-strain-nies2145-phosphorus-starvationinducible-promoter-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17.988,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17.988},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6360787,"mean":5.8382518437193,"rank":314843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":6045937,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6360787,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196340,"mean":9.6301417038897,"rank":17588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":178751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196340,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4300,"mean":3.73833403117,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":4155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4300,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":407,"mean":2.9104876847291,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":407,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
