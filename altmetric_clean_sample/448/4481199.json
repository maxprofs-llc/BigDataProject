(Y.

However, efficient TADF materials with colors ranging from red, to deep-red, to near-infrared (NIR) have been rarely reported owing to the difficulty in molecular design. Herein, we report the first NIR TADF molecule TPA-DCPP (TPA=triphenylamine; DCPP=2,3-dicyanopyrazino phenanthrene) which has a small singlet-triplet splitting (\u0394EST ) of 0.13\u2005eV. Its nondoped OLED device exhibits a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.1\u2009% with a Commission International de L'\u00c9clairage (CIE) coordinate of (0.70, 0.29). Moreover, an extremely high EQE of nearly 10\u2009% with an emission band at \u03bb=668\u2005nm has been achieved in the doped device, which is comparable to the most-efficient deep-red\/NIR phosphorescent OLEDs with similar electroluminescent spectra.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Wang, Shipan","Yan, Xianju","Cheng, Zong","Zhang, Hongyu","Liu, Yu","Wang, Yue"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201506687","endpage":"13072","first_seen_on":"2015-09-07T12:41:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773"],"issue":"44","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
