We used the M\u00fcllerian inhibiting substance type 2 receptor (Mis2r) promoter and a truncated form of the Follicle stimulating hormone receptor (Fshr) promoter to introduce conditional knockouts of Brca1 and p53 not only in mouse mammary and M\u00fcllerian epithelia, but also in organs that control the estrous cycle. Sixty percent of the double mutant mice developed invasive M\u00fcllerian and mammary carcinomas. Mice carrying heterozygous mutations in Brca1 and p53 also developed invasive tumors, albeit at a lesser (30%) rate, in which the wild type alleles were no longer present due to loss of heterozygosity. While mice carrying heterozygous mutations in both genes developed mammary tumors, none of the mice carrying only a heterozygous p53 mutation developed such tumors (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), attesting to a role for Brca1 mutations in tumor development. This mouse model is attractive to investigate cell-nonautonomous mechanisms associated with cancer predisposition in BRCA1 mutation carriers and to investigate the merit of chemo-preventive drugs targeting such mechanisms.","altmetric_jid":"544fc66b2a83ee03188b4567","authors":["Liu, Ying","Yen, Hai-Yun","Austria, Theresa","Pettersson, Jonas","Peti-Peterdi, Janos","Maxson, Robert","Widschwendter, Martin","Dubeau, Louis","Ying Liu","Hai-Yun Yen","Theresa Austria","Jonas Pettersson","Janos Peti-Peterdi","Robert Maxson","Martin Widschwendter","Louis Dubeau"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ebiom.2015.08.034","endpage":"1330","first_seen_on":"2015-09-09T05:26:32+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["23523964","2352-3964"],"issue":"10","journal":"EBioMedicine","last_mentioned_on":1473948798,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2352396415301171","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ebiom.2015.08.034","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4634618"],"pmcid":"PMC4634618","pmid":"26629527","pubdate":"2015-12-03T22:00:30+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","startpage":"1318","title":"A Mouse Model That Reproduces the Developmental Pathways and Site Specificity of the Cancers Associated With the Human BRCA1 Mutation Carrier State","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mouse-model-reproduces-developmental-pathways-site-specificity-cancers-associated-human-brca1-mutati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":65.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":65.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":141368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8244684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233367,"mean":9.257736079806,"rank":6388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":226974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233367,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":998,"mean":22.960461384152,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":998,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":10.781411764706,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
