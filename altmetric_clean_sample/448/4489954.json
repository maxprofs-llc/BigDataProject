The present work presents the first attempt to address the fundamental reaction chemistry of the catalytic transformation. An enzyme-like catalytic mechanism of ILs, in which glycosidic bond hydrolysis proceeds through a retaining mechanism and\/or an inverting mechanism, is proposed. DFT calculations show that both mechanisms involve moderate barriers (<30\u2005kcal\u2009mol(-1) ), which is consistent with the catalytic performance of the ILs under mild conditions (<100\u2009\u00b0C). The \"biomimetic\" mechanism model proposed herein is expected to be viable for understanding the unique catalytic activity of ILs under mild conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dda","authors":["Li, Jingjing","Li, Jinghua","Zhang, Dongju","Liu, Chengbu"],"doi":"10.1002\/cphc.201500424","endpage":"3048","first_seen_on":"2015-09-09T15:24:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1439-7641"],"issue":"14","journal":"ChemPhysChem","last_mentioned_on":1441812254,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/cphc.201500424"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201500424\/pdf","pmid":"26351066","pubdate":"2015-09-10T22:01:01+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
