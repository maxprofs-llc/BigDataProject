People with cancer receiving adjuvant cancer treatment with curative intent, were eligible to participate. Carers completed the Supportive Care Needs Survey-Partners & Caregivers (SCNS-P&C45), and both carers and patients completed the Centre of Epidemiologic-Depression Scale (CES-D).\nOverall, 57% of carers reported at least one, 37% at least three, 31% at least five, and 15% at least 10 unmet needs; the most commonly endorsed unmet needs were in the domains of information and health care service needs. Thirty percent of carers and 36% of patients were at risk of clinical depression. A weak to moderate positive relationship was observed between unmet needs and carer depression (r=0.30, p<0.001). Carer levels of unmet needs were significantly associated with carer age, hospital type, treatment type, cancer type, living situation, relationship status (in both uni- and multi-factor analysis); person with cancer age and carer level of education (in unifactor analysis only); but not with carer gender or patient gender (in both uni- and multi-factor analyses).\nFindings highlight the importance of developing tailored programmes to systematically assist carers who are supporting patients through the early stages of cancer treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e9a","authors":["Heckel, L","Fennell, K M","Reynolds, J","Osborne, R H","Chirgwin, J","Botti, M","Ashley, D M","Livingston, P M","L.
