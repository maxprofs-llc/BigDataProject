The IVF patients were stratified into 2 groups: patients who had generally good embryogenesis and a positive pregnancy (n = 55), and patients with generally poor embryogenesis (n = 72; 42 positive and 30 negative pregnancies) after IVF.\nGenomewide sperm DNA methylation analysis was performed to measure methylation at >485,000 sites across the genome.\nA comparison was made of DNA methylation patterns of IVF patients vs. normozoospermic, fertile men.\nPredictive models proved to be highly accurate in classifying male fertility status (fertile or infertile), with 82% sensitivity, and 99% positive predictive value. Hierarchic clustering identified clusters enriched for IVF patient samples and for poor-quality-embryo samples. Models built to identify samples within these groups, from neat samples, achieved positive predictive value \u226594% while identifying >one fifth of all IVF patient and poor-quality-embryo samples in each case. Using density gradient prepared samples, the same approach recovered 46% of poor-quality-embryo samples with no false positives.\nSperm DNA methylation patterns differ significantly and consistently for infertile vs. fertile, normozoospermic men. In addition, DNA methylation patterns may be predictive of embryo quality during IVF.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c7","authors":["Aston, Kenneth I","Uren, Philip J","Jenkins, Timothy G","Horsager, Alan","Cairns, Bradley R","Smith, Andrew D","Carrell, Douglas T"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fertnstert.2015.08.019","first_seen_on":"2015-09-07T23:57:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0015-0282","00150282","1556-5653"],"journal":"Fertility & Sterility","last_mentioned_on":1476884700,"links":["http:\/\/www.fertstert.org\/article\/S0015-0282(15)01865-8\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0015028215018658?_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_docanchor&md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb","http:\/\/www.fertstert.org\/article\/S0015-0282(15)01865-8\/abstract","http:\/\/www.fertstert.org\/article\/S0015-0282%2815%2901865-8\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.fertnstert.2015.08.019","https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0015028215018658?np=y","http:\/\/www.fertstert.org\/article\/S0015-0282(15)01865-8\/abstract?elsca1=etoc&amp;elsca2=email&amp;elsca3=0015-0282_201512_104_6_&amp;elsca4=Obstetrics%20and%20Gynecology","http:\/\/www.fertstert.org\/article\/S0015-0282(15)01865-8\/abstract?utm_source=Providers+List&utm_campaign=e1af8a41e9-BLOG_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_875f87f815-e1af8a41e9-100636945&ct=t(BLOG_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN)&mc_cid=e1af8a41e9&mc_eid=b049a8a7c5","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26361204"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.fertstert.org\/article\/S0015028215018658\/pdf","pmid":"26361204","pubdate":"2015-09-12T22:00:13+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Aberrant sperm DNA methylation predicts male fertility status and embryo quality","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aberrant-sperm-dna-methylation-predicts-male-fertility-status-embryo-quality"},"altmetric_score":{"score":511.25,"score_history":{"1y":484,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":511.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7560115,"mean":6.5270342886323,"rank":6273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":7553890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7560115,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229205,"mean":9.031920716916,"rank":289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":228916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229205,"percentile":99},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3914,"mean":6.4428392537695,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":3910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3914,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141,"mean":6.1269571428571,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141,"percentile":99}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
