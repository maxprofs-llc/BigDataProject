(F. Micoli)"],"citation":{"abstract":"A series of glycoconjugates with defined connectivity were synthesized to investigate the impact of coupling Salmonella typhimurium O-antigen to different amino acids of CRM197 protein carrier. In particular, two novel methods for site-selective glycan conjugation were developed to obtain conjugates with single attachment site on the protein, based on chemical modification of a disulfide bond and pH-controlled transglutaminase-catalyzed modification of lysine, respectively. Importantly, conjugation at the C186-201 bond resulted in significantly higher anti O-antigen bactericidal antibody titers than coupling to K37\/39, and in comparable titers to conjugates bearing a larger number of saccharides. This study demonstrates that the conjugation site plays a role in determining the immunogenicity in mice and one single attachment point may be sufficient to induce high levels of bactericidal antibodies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Stefanetti, Giuseppe","Hu, Qi-Ying","Usera, Aimee","Robinson, Zack","Allan, Martin","Singh, Alok","Imase, Hidetomo","Cobb, Jennifer","Zhai, Huili","Quinn, Douglas","Lei, Ming","Saul, Allan","Adamo, Roberto","MacLennan, Calman A","Micoli, Francesca","Hu, Qi\u2010Ying","MacLennan, Calman A."],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201506112","endpage":"13203","first_seen_on":"2015-09-09T14:50:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773","14337851"],"issue":"45","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
