Although preclinical data suggest that sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition (TKI) is decreased in EGFR-mutant lung cancers also harboring a PIK3CA mutation, this interaction has not been explored clinically.\nPatients with lung adenocarcinomas harboring a PIK3CA mutation concurrent with a separate driver mutation were identified via mutational hotspot testing, multiplex sizing assays, and FISH. Overall survival (OS) and outcomes with EGFR TKI monotherapy (EGFR-mutant) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and compared between double mutant (EGFR or KRAS-mutant, concurrent PIK3C-mutant) and single mutant patients (EGFR or KRAS-mutant, PI3KCA wild-type) using log-rank tests.\nIn EGFR and KRAS-mutant lung cancers, a concurrent PIK3CA mutation was associated with a decrease in median OS: 18 vs 33 months (EGFR double n=10 vs single n=43 mutant, p=0.006), and 9 vs 16 months (KRAS double n=16 vs single n=47 mutant, p=0.020). In EGFR-mutant lung cancers, a concurrent PIK3CA mutation did not impact benefit from EGFR TKI monotherapy. Single vs double mutant: objective response rate 83% (n=29) vs 62% (n=6, p=0.80), median time to progression 11 (n=29) vs 8 months (n=6, p=0.84), and median duration of TKI therapy 15 (n=32) vs 15 months (n=10, p=0.65).\nA concurrent PIK3CA mutation is a poor prognostic factor in patients with advanced EGFR- or KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas. There was no evidence that clinical benefit from EGFR TKI monotherapy is affected by a concurrent PIK3CA mutation in EGFR-mutant lung cancers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007efc","authors":["Eng, Juliana","Woo, Kaitlin M","Sima, Camelia S","Plodkowski, Andrew","Hellmann, Matthew D","Chaft, Jamie","Kris, Mark G","Arcila, Maria E","Ladanyi, Marc","Drilon, Alexander"],"doi":"10.1097\/jto.0000000000000671","endpage":"1719","first_seen_on":"2015-09-08T15:21:26+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1556-1380","1556-0864","15560864"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of Thoracic Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1449417466,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jto\/9000\/00000\/Impact_of_concurrent_PIK3CA_mutations_on_response.98919.pdf","http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jto\/9000\/00000\/Impact_of_concurrent_PIK3CA_mutations_on_response.98919.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jto\/Abstract\/2015\/12000\/Impact_of_Concurrent_PIK3CA_Mutations_on_Response.11.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jto\/9000\/00000\/Impact_of_concurrent_PIK3CA_mutations_on_response.98919.pdf","pmid":"26334752","pubdate":"2015-09-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1713","subjects":["neoplasms","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Impact of Concurrent PIK3CA Mutations on Response to EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition in EGFR-Mutant Lung Cancers and on Prognosis in Oncogene-Driven Lung Adenocarcinomas","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-concurrent-pik3ca-mutations-response-egfr-tyrosine-kinase-inhibition-egfrmutant-lung-cancers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6661874,"mean":6.1608212143919,"rank":3180533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1986321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6661874,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225126,"mean":8.9032961154915,"rank":115714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":86604,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225126,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1858,"mean":4.2506720516963,"rank":777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1858,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":3.8110322580645,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":3,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
