Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular, cellular and epigenetic mechanisms that orchestrate plant responses to abiotic stress will serve as the platform to engineer improved crop plants with better designed root system architecture and optimized metabolism to enhance water and nutrients uptake and use efficiency and\/or soil penetration. In this review we discuss such advances and how the generated knowledge could be used to integrate effective strategies to engineer crops by gene transfer or genome editing technologies.","altmetric_jid":"55c212452a83ee1f7c8b4567","authors":["Damar L\u00f3pez-Arredondo","Sandra Isabel Gonz\u00e1lez-Morales","Elohim Bello-Bello","Gerardo Alejo-Jacuinde","Luis Herrera"],"doi":"10.12688\/f1000research.6538.1","first_seen_on":"2015-09-07T11:34:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2046-1402"],"issue":"F1000 Faculty Rev","journal":"F1000 Research","last_mentioned_on":1443953460,"links":["http:\/\/f1000research.com\/articles\/4-651\/v1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26380074?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/f1000research.com\/articles\/4-651\/v1\/pdf","pmid":"26380074","pubdate":"2015-09-02T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Engineering food crops to grow in harsh environments.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/engineering-food-crops-grow-harsh-environments"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6362117,"mean":5.9150643845552,"rank":504893,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":5855275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6362117,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196795,"mean":9.6651189670417,"rank":25778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":170911,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196795,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1210,"mean":10.715265508685,"rank":233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1210,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":14.268289855072,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
