Recruitment of monocytes to obese AT has been the most studied mechanism explaining this accumulation. However, recent evidence suggests that recruitment-independent mechanisms may also regulate pro-inflammatory AT macrophage (ATM) numbers. The role of increased ATM survival during obesity has yet to be explored.\nWe demonstrate that activation of apoptotic pathways is significantly reduced in ATMs from diet-induced and genetically obese mice. Concurrently, pro-survival Bcl-2 family member protein levels and localization to the mitochondria is elevated in ATMs from obese mice. This increased pro-survival signaling was associated with elevated activation of the transcription factor, NF-\u03baB, and increased expression of its pro-survival target genes. Finally, an obesogenic milieu increased ATM viability only when NF-\u03baB signaling pathways were functional.\nOur data demonstrate that obesity promotes survival of inflammatory ATMs, possibly through an NF-\u03baB-regulated mechanism.","altmetric_jid":"537f30862a83eeb45a8b4630","authors":["Hill, Andrea A","Anderson-Baucum, Emily K","Kennedy, Arion J","Webb, Corey D","Yull, Fiona E","Hasty, Alyssa H"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.molmet.2015.07.005","first_seen_on":"2015-09-08T15:41:25+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms","nhlbi"],"issns":["2212-8778"],"issue":"10","journal":"Molecular Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1441717200,"links":["http:\/\/www.molmetab.com\/article\/S2212-8778(15)00139-8\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.molmetab.com\/article\/S2212877815001398\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4588436","pmid":"26779432","pubdate":"2016-01-19T22:00:45+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Activation of NF-\u03baB drives the enhanced survival of adipose tissue macrophages in an obesogenic environment","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/activation-nf%CE%BAb-drives-enhanced-survival-adipose-tissue-macrophages-obesogenic-environment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.264,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.264},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6310269,"mean":5.8189270915273,"rank":1019690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5290015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6310269,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195127,"mean":9.6488127261359,"rank":44269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":150849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195127,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242,"mean":8.1758174273859,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.64,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
