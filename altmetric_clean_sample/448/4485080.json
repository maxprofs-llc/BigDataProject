Studies, up to date, rely on a limited basis of data sets and additional studies are needed to confirm the findings of previous studies. In particular, data for Europe are lacking, and are needed in light of a recent ruling of the European Court of Justice that addressed weight-based discrimination.\nThe data were derived from a large representative telephone survey in Germany (n=3 003). The dependent variable-weight-based discrimination was assessed with a one-item question. The life-time prevalence of weight discrimination across different socio-demographic variables was determined. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association of independent and dependent variables. A sub-group analysis was conducted analyzing all participants with a BMI \u2a7e25\u2009kg\/m(2).\nThe overall prevalence of weight-based discrimination was 7.3%. Large differences, however, were observed regarding weight status. In normal-weight and overweight participants the prevalence was 5.6%, but this number doubled in participants with obesity class I (10.2%), and quadrupled in participants with obesity class II (18.7%) and under-weight (19.7%). In participants with obesity class III, every third participant reported accounts of weight-based discrimination (38%). In regression models, after adjustment, the associations of weight status and female gender (Odds Ratio: 2.59, P<0.001) remained highly significant.\nDiscrimination seems to be an ubiquitary phenomenon at least for some groups that are at special risk, such as heavier individuals and women. Our findings therefore emphasize the need for research and intervention on weight discrimination among adults with obesity, including anti-discrimination legislation.International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 27 August 2015. doi:10.1038\/ijo.2015.165.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b83","authors":["C Sikorski","J Spahlholz","M Hartlev","S G Riedel-Heller"],"doi":"10.1038\/ijo.2015.165","first_seen_on":"2015-09-08T13:55:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-5497","0307-0565"],"journal":"International Journal of Obesity","last_mentioned_on":1456748498,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ijo\/journal\/vaop\/naam\/abs\/ijo2015165a.html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ijo.2015.165","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ijo\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ijo2015165a.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ijo\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/ijo2015165a.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ijo\/journal\/v40\/n2\/abs\/ijo2015165a.html?WT.ec_id=IJO-201602&spMailingID=50654807&spUserID=MTI2NzY1MDk3OTQzS0&spJobID=861089853&spReportId=ODYxMDg5ODUzS0","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ijo\/journal\/v40\/n2\/full\/ijo2015165a.html"],"pmid":"26311336","pubdate":"2015-08-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"Weight-based discrimination: an ubiquitary phenomenon|[quest]|","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/weightbased-discrimination-ubiquitary-phenomenon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":21.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":21.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8053683,"mean":6.8392860880244,"rank":376371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7677931,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8053683,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231945,"mean":9.1873588797297,"rank":16647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":215268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231945,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2389,"mean":16.061099664992,"rank":342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":2046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2389,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":36.345706666667,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
