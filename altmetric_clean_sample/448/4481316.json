With steep dose gradients, small changes in position can confer significant dosimetric impact on adjacent structures. We analysed positioning error in consecutively treated patients on a strict image-guidance protocol with online correction in 6 degrees of freedom (6-DOF).\nSet-up error, residual error post-correction and intra-fraction motion for 30 courses of spinal SBRT in 27 patients were assessed using cone-beam CT. Positional error was corrected in x, y and z translational planes and rotational axes using a robotic couch, applying 2\u2009mm and 2\u00b0 action levels. Linear mixed-effects model assessed whether positional error was influenced by factors such as vertebral level, immobilisation device and treatment duration.\nSixty-two fractions were delivered with 225 image registrations. Median treatment duration was significantly longer for patients treated with static-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy compared with volumetric-modulated arc treatment - 40\u2009min versus 28\u2009min, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.01). Across all fractions, the median residual positional error after initial correction was greatest in the x translational plane (0.5\u2009mm; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3-0.6) and y rotational axis (0.25\u00b0; 95% CI 0.1-0.3). Median intra-fraction error was also greatest in the x-plane (0.7\u2009mm; 95% CI 0.5-1.0) and y-axis (0.4\u00b0; 95% CI 0.2-0.5).\nWith strict immobilisation, image-guidance and 6-DOF correction, our current practice of applying 3-mm planning margins for target volumes and critical structures appears safe. Lower image-guidance action thresholds plus verification with end-to-end testing would be recommended before further reducing margins.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e43","authors":["Finnigan, Renee","Lamprecht, Brock","Barry, Tamara","Jones, Kimberley","Boyd, Joshua","Pullar, Andrew","Burmeister, Bryan","Foote, Matthew"],"doi":"10.1111\/1754-9485.12353","endpage":"118","first_seen_on":"2015-09-07T13:24:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1754-9485"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Medical Imaging & Radiation Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1441647953,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/1754-9485.12353#727443"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1754-9485.12353\/pdf","pmid":"26813044","pubdate":"2016-01-28T22:01:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"112","subjects":["radiology","neoplasms","diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Inter\u2010 and intra\u2010fraction motion in stereotactic body radiotherapy for spinal and paraspinal tumours using cone\u2010beam CT and positional correction in six degrees of freedom","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inter-intrafraction-motion-stereotactic-body-radiotherapy-spinal-paraspinal-tumours-using-conebeam-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6463141,"mean":5.9746759735975,"rank":2478634,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3909280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6463141,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198209,"mean":9.5674566112367,"rank":79411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":116153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198209,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268,"mean":2.7654307116105,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.6857142857143,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
