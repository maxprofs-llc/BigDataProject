This study added nasal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) probes for S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and respiratory viruses. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels were measured. Pathogens were identified in 78% of the patients. For detection of viruses, patients were randomized to either a 5-virus laboratory-generated PCR bundle or the 17-virus FilmArray PCR platform. The FilmArray PCR platform detected more viruses than the laboratory-generated bundle and did so in less than 2hours. There were fewer days of antibiotic therapy, P=0.003, in CAP patients with viral infections and a low serum PCT levels.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026ff","authors":["Gelfer, Gita","Leggett, James","Myers, Jillian","Wang, Luan","Gilbert, David N"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.diagmicrobio.2015.08.001","first_seen_on":"2015-09-07T06:21:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0070"],"journal":"Diagnostic Microbiology & Infectious Disease","last_mentioned_on":1442078329,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26341706"],"pmid":"26341706","pubdate":"2015-09-07T22:00:17+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"The clinical impact of the detection of potential etiologic pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-impact-detection-potential-etiologic-pathogens-communityacquired-pneumonia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6326302,"mean":5.8274056156985,"rank":1395076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":4918211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6326302,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195432,"mean":9.6436004420998,"rank":58569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":136194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195432,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":548,"mean":1.6454296160878,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":499,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":548,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.3822580645161,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
