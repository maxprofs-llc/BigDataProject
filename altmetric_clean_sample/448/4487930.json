Pyridone derivatives showed better activities than pyrone derivatives against FabI and Staphylococcus aureus strains, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Among the pyridone derivatives, compound 16l especially exhibited promising activities against the MRSA strain and good pharmacokinetic profiles.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f2","authors":["Kim, Yun Gyeong","Seo, Jae Hong","Kwak, Jin Hwan","Shin, Kye Jung"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmcl.2015.08.077","first_seen_on":"2015-09-09T08:15:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1464-3405"],"journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters","last_mentioned_on":1441786523,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26343826?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26343826","pubdate":"2015-09-09T22:02:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Discovery of a potent enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) inhibitor suitable for antistaphylococcal agent.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/discovery-potent-enoylacyl-carrier-protein-reductase-fabi-inhibitor-suitable-antistaphylococcal-agen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6315239,"mean":5.8222232064737,"rank":4662475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":937040,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6315239,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194890,"mean":9.6502924844399,"rank":134284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194890,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1844,"mean":2.6012631578947,"rank":1113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1844,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":1.4634929577465,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
