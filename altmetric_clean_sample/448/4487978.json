DFT studies indicate that the reaction involves the [2+2] cyclo-addition of a double bond of O[double bond, length as m-dash]CO to the U-N(SiMe3)2 bond and proceeds to the final product through multiple silyl migration steps.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e2","authors":["Cl\u00e9ment Camp","Lucile Chatelain","Christos E.
