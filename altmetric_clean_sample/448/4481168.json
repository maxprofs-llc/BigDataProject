(H. Gruetzmacher)"],"citation":{"abstract":"Enzymes and cofactors with iron-sulfur heterocubane core structures, [Fe4 S4 ], are often found in nature as electron transfer reagents in fundamental catalytic transformations. An artificial heterocubane with a [Fe4 N4 ] core is reported that can reversibly store up to four electrons at very negative potentials. The neutral [Fe4 N4 ] and the singly reduced low-valent [Fe4 N4 ](-) heterocubanes were isolated and fully characterized. The low-valent species bears one unpaired electron, which is localized predominantly at one iron center in the electronic ground state but fluctuates with increasing temperatures. The electrons stored or released by the [Fe4 N4 ]\/[Fe4 N4 ](-) redox couple can be used in reductive or oxidative C\uf8ffC couplings and even allow catalytic one-pot reactions, which show a remarkably enhanced selectivity in the presence of the [Fe4 N4 ] heterocubanes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Lichtenberg, Crispin","Garcia Rubio, In\u00e9s","Viciu, Liliana","Adelhardt, Mario","Meyer, Karsten","Jeschke, Gunnar","Gr\u00fctzmacher, Hansj\u00f6rg","Garcia\u2005Rubio, In\u00e9s","Crispin Lichtenberg","In\u00e9s Garcia Rubio","Liliana Viciu","Mario Adelhardt","Karsten Meyer","Gunnar Jeschke","Hansj\u00f6rg Gr\u00fctzmacher"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201505668","endpage":"13017","first_seen_on":"2015-09-07T12:26:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773","14337851"],"issue":"44","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
