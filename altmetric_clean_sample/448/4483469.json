This study aims to investigate the carbapenemase genes and the clonal relatedness among A. baumannii clinical isolates in a Chinese hospital.\nCarbapenemase genes and the upstream locations of insertion sequences were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the clonal relatedness of isolates was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing.\nA total of 231 nonduplicate carbapenemase gene-harboring A. baumannii clinical isolates recovered from Shenzhen People's Hospital, were investigated between 2002 and 2009. blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-58-like, blaOXA-40-like, and ISAba1-blaOXA-51-like were identified in 119, 107, 1, and 4 isolates, respectively. IS1008-\u0394ISAba3, ISAba3, and ISAba1 were detected upstream of the blaOXA-58-like gene in 69, 35, and 3 isolates, respectively. All blaOXA-23-like genes but one had an upstream insertion of ISAba1. blaOXA-58-like was the most common carbapenemase gene in A.baumannii before 2008, thereafter blaOXA-23-like became rapidly prevalent and replaced blaOXA-58-like in 2009. The majority of blaOXA-58-like-carrying isolates showed lower level of resistance to imipenem and meropenem (minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), 1 \u03bcg\/ml to 16 \u03bcg\/ml), compared with the majority of blaOXA-23-like-carrying isolates (MICs, 16 \u03bcg\/ml to 64 \u03bcg\/ml for both imipenem and meropenem). All 231 blaOXA carbapenemase gene-harboring isolates belonged to 14 PFGE types (A-N), and three dominant clones A, J, and H accounted for 43.3%, 42.0%, and 8.2% of the tested isolates, respectively. Clone A (sequence type ST92\/ST208) with blaOXA-58-like was the most prevalent before 2008. Clone H (ST229) with blaOXA-23-like became striking between 2007 and 2008. Clone J (ST381) with blaOXA-23-like rapidly spread and replaced clones A and H in 2009.\nThis study is the first to reveal that the distinct blaOXA-23-like-carrying A. baumannii ST381 displaced the previously prevalent blaOXA-58-like-carrying A. baumannii ST92\/ST208, resulting in the rapidly increasing resistance to carbapenems in A. baumannii in Shenzhen People's Hospital in 2009.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Wu, Weiyuan","He, Yi","Lu, Jian","Lu, Yuemei","Wu, Jinsong","Liu, Yingxia"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0137174","first_seen_on":"2015-09-08T07:01:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1463825375,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26340666?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26340666","pubdate":"2015-09-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Transition of blaOXA-58-like to blaOXA-23-like in Acinetobacter baumannii Clinical Isolates in Southern China: An 8-Year Study.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transition-blaoxa58like-blaoxa23like-acinetobacter-baumannii-clinical-isolates-southern-china-8year"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7724913,"mean":6.6254088328702,"rank":5841674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1042137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7724913,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230023,"mean":9.0588130091904,"rank":158770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":38556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230023,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109733,"mean":10.268841122007,"rank":79862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":17212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109733,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5993,"mean":8.7768341121495,"rank":4357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5993,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
