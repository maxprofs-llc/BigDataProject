For the complexation of Cm(iii) the influence of the medium (10(-3) M HClO4 \u2192 0.5 M HNO3) is investigated in detail revealing important impacts of the applied medium (pH, ionic strength, anions) on the speciation and conditional stability constants. SO3-Ph-BTBP forms 1\u2009:\u20092 complexes with Cm(iii) and Eu(iii). The conditional stability constants of [Cm(SO3-Ph-BTBP)2](5-) and [Eu(SO3-Ph-BTBP)2](5-) in 0.5 M HNO3 are determined to be log\u2009\u03b202 = 7.3 \u00b1 0.3 and log\u2009\u03b202 = 5.4 \u00b1 0.5, respectively. The difference of 1.9 orders of magnitude is in line with hydrophobic BT(B)P type ligands and shows that the selectivity is not affected by tuning the hydrophilicity using SO3-Ph-side chains.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Christoph Wagner","Udo M\u00fcllich","Andreas Geist","Petra J.
