PKA phosphorylation events are typically spatially restricted and temporally well controlled. A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) directly bind PKA and recruit it to specific subcellular loci targeting the kinase activity toward particular substrates, and thereby provide discrete spatiotemporal control of downstream phosphorylation events. AKAPs also scaffold other signaling molecules into multi-protein complexes that function as crossroads between different signaling pathways. Targeting AKAP coordinated protein complexes with high-affinity peptidomimetics or small molecules to tease apart distinct protein-protein interactions (PPIs) therefore offers important means to disrupt binding of specific components of the complex to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the function of individual signalosomes and their pathophysiological role. Furthermore, development of novel classes of small molecules involved in displacement of AKAP-bound signal molecules is now emerging. Here, we will focus on mechanisms for targeting PPI, disruptors that modulate downstream cAMP signaling and their role, especially in the heart.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc18","authors":["Calejo, Ana Isabel C.","Task\u00e9n, Kjetil"],"doi":"10.3389\/fphar.2015.00192","first_seen_on":"2015-09-08T14:15:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1663-9812"],"journal":"Frontiers in Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1441721707,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphar.2015.00192\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphar.2015.00192\/pdf","pmid":"26441649","pubdate":"2015-09-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Targeting protein\u2013protein interactions in complexes organized by A kinase anchoring proteins","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/campdependent-phosphorylation-stimulates-water-permeability-aquaporincollecting-duct-water-channel-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6311299,"mean":5.820165748155,"rank":5374882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6311299,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195145,"mean":9.6486177489443,"rank":156314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195145,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1198,"mean":2.4212631578947,"rank":1017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1198,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":1.9168539325843,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
