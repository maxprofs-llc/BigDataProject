We report data on retention in care and its associated determinants in Tigray, Ethiopia.\nWe used data from the CASA project, a prospective observational and multi-site study of a cohort of HIV-infected patients who initiated ART for the first time in Tigray. Four participating health facilities (HFs) located in the South of Tigray were considered for this study. Patients were followed for one year after ART initiation. The main outcome measure was represented by the current retention in care, defined as the proportion of patients who were alive and receiving ART at the same HF one year after ART initiation. Patients who started ART between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013 were included in this analysis. Patients were followed for one year after ART initiation. The determinants of retention were analysed using univariate and multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards model with robust sandwich estimates to account for within HF correlation.\nThe four participating HFs in Tigray were able to retain overall 85.1% of their patients after one year from starting ART. Loss to follow-up (5.5%) and transfers to other HF (6.6) were the main determinant of attrition. A multivariate analysis shows that the factors significantly associated with retention were the type of HF, gender and active TB. Alamata health center was the HF with the highest attrition rate (HR 2.99, 95% CI: 2.77-3.23). Active TB (HR 1.72, 95% CI: 1.23-2.41) and gender (HR 1.64, 95% CI: 1.10-2.56) were also significantly associated with attrition.\nAlthough Ethiopia has significantly improved access to the ART program, achieving and maintaining a satisfactory long-term retention rate is a future goal. This is difficult because of different retention rates among HFs. Moreover specific interventions should be directed to people of different sex to improve retention in care in male population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Raffaella Bucciardini","Vincenzo Fragola","Teshome Abegaz","Stefano Lucattini","Atakilt Halifom","Eskedar Tadesse","Micheal Berhe","Katherina Pugliese","Andrea Binelli","Paola De Castro","Roberta Terlizzi","Luca Fucili","Massimiliano Di Gregorio","Marco Mirra","Erika Olivieri","Tsigemariam Teklu","Teame Zegeye","Amanuel Haile","Stefano Vella","Loko Abraham","CASA-project Health Facilities"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0136117","first_seen_on":"2015-09-07T06:50:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1442905102,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0136117"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0136117.PDF","pmid":"26340271","pubdate":"2015-09-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0136117","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Retention in Care of Adult HIV Patients Initiating Antiretroviral Therapy in Tigray, Ethiopia: A Prospective Observational Cohort Study","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retention-care-adult-hiv-patients-initiating-antiretroviral-therapy-tigray-ethiopia-prospective-obse-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6386702,"mean":5.8553449560254,"rank":992569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":5390259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6386702,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196642,"mean":9.6320135577015,"rank":43176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":153249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196642,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97396,"mean":9.6943629139074,"rank":21589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":75738,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97396,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5988,"mean":8.3051364623351,"rank":1184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4799,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5988,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
