The composition of intestinal microbiota of healthy pre-school and school-age children resembled that of adults. During probiotic supplementation, the population levels of Bifidobacterium and total Lactobacillus increased significantly, while those of Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus and Clostridium perfringens decreased significantly. A significant increase in fecal concentrations of organic acids and also a decrease in fecal pH were observed during the ingestion period. However, the patterns of fecal microbiota and intestinal environment were found to revert to the baseline levels (i.e. before ingestion) within 6 months following the cessation of probiotic intake.\nRegular intake of an LcS-containing probiotic product may modify the gut microbiota composition and intestinal environment in pre-school and school-age children while maintaining the homeostasis of the microbiota.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000227e","authors":["Wang, Chongxin","Nagata, Satoru","Asahara, Takashi","Yuki, Norikatsu","Matsuda, Kazunori","Tsuji, Hirokazu","Takahashi, Takuya","Nomoto, Koji","Yamashiro, Yuichiro","Wang, C.","Nagata, S.","Asahara, T.","Yuki, N.","Matsuda, K.","Tsuji, H.","Takahashi, T.","Nomoto, K.","Yamashiro, Y."],"doi":"10.1159\/000441066","endpage":"266","first_seen_on":"2015-10-28T07:29:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1421-9697"],"issue":"4","journal":"Annals of Nutrition & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1472726679,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26496372?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/Abstract\/441066"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/Pdf\/441066","pmid":"26496372","pubdate":"2015-10-28T22:03:43+00:00","publisher":"Karger Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"257","subjects":["metabolism","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Intestinal Microbiota Profiles of Healthy Pre-School and School-Age Children and Effects of Probiotic Supplementation.","type":"article","volume":"67","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intestinal-microbiota-profiles-healthy-preschool-schoolage-children-effects-probiotic-supplementatio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":3271240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5006649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245237,"mean":9.7876470909652,"rank":77706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":166044,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245237,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":649,"mean":7.2394382716049,"rank":325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":649,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":5.1813636363636,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Immunology and Microbiology":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":3,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BetsyGervasi\/statuses\/658064231615565824","license":"gnip","rt":["eossipov"],"citation_ids":[4682729],"posted_on":"2015-10-24T23:35:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Betsy Gervasi","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/635169253700829184\/3PAsqhng_normal.jpg","description":"Lifelong Liberal,  mother, grandmother,  Sister.
