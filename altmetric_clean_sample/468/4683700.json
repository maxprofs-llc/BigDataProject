However, there are currently no practice guidelines or practice patterns for the utilization of unimodal and multimodal IOM for specific surger - ies. This study reviews IOM modalities and documents practice patterns of spine surgeons at our single-center tertiary hospital about their use of various IOM modali - ties on 23 spinal procedures. As different intraoperative monitoring modalities have shown to have different sen - sitivities and specificities, devising practice guidelines for IOM utilization in specific spinal procedures should be considered.","authors":["Rattenni, Rachel N","Cheriyan, Thomas","Lee, Alexandra","Bendo, John A","Errico, Thomas J","Goldstein, Jeffrey E"],"first_seen_on":"2015-10-28T10:54:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2328-5273"],"issue":"3","journal":"Bulletin of the Hospital for Joint Disease (2013)","last_mentioned_on":1446029644,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26506145?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26506145","pubdate":"2015-10-28T22:00:13+00:00","title":"Intraoperative Spinal Cord and Nerve Root Monitoring A Hospital Survey and Review.","type":"article","volume":"73"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TC_papers\/statuses\/659322232599019520","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4683700],"posted_on":"2015-10-28T10:54:04+00:00","author":{"name":"TC_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507539334375829504\/IcPjrJI3_normal.jpeg","description":"Pubmed twitterbot: arealization OR patterning OR somatosensory OR thalamus OR thalamocortical OR cortical development","id_on_source":"TC_papers","tweeter_id":"2789910212","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":180},"tweet_id":"659322232599019520"}]}}
