Through the years, the main themes and emphases of parenting education have changed, sometimes to reflect the new socio-economic structure and sometimes forced by the women themselves seeking specific information and knowledge. Yet again, this time the invasion of online information and social media is about to change the perception and the philosophy of antenatal education from an informative opportunity to a powerful and effective intervention.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c46","authors":["Nikolova, Gergana"],"first_seen_on":"2015-10-28T08:27:20+00:00","issns":["1461-3123"],"issue":"2","journal":"Practising Midwife","last_mentioned_on":1446020824,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26333248?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26333248","pubdate":"2015-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","obstetrics"],"title":"Internet: a new concept of antenatal education.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/internet-new-concept-antenatal-education"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6500718,"mean":6.0222432796255,"rank":3077374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1943182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6500718,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207323,"mean":10.262563799307,"rank":110943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":75310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207323,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":1.58625,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.075,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
