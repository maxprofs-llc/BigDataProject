However, the role of miR-519 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has yet to be elucidated. The present study identified the effects of miR\u2011519 on HL60 human acute myeloid leukemia cell growth and apoptosis. The expression levels of miR\u2011519 were examined in AML cells, as well as AML tissue samples. Furthermore, cell viability and apoptosis were examined in HL60 cells transfected with miR\u2011519 mimics, miR\u2011519 inhibitors or a negative control. In addition, the effects of human antigen\u00a0R (HuR) on cell apoptosis were investigated using specific small interfering RNA targeting HuR. The results demonstrated that the expression levels of miR\u2011519 were significantly increased in the AML cells and the tissue samples, suggesting that miR\u2011519 may contribute to abnormal HL60 cell proliferation. Upregulation of miR\u2011519 expression decreased HL60 cell viability and induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, knockdown of HuR reduced cell migration and enhanced cell apoptosis. The results of the present study indicate that miR\u2011519 may contribute to HL60 cell apoptosis by regulating the expression of HuR.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Huang, Kebin","Dong, Bingwei","Wang, Yueyue","Tian, Tao","Zhang, Biying"],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2015.4455","first_seen_on":"2015-10-27T20:21:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-3004"],"journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1445977267,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26499919?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26499919","pubdate":"2015-10-27T22:00:59+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"MicroRNA-519 enhances HL60 human acute myeloid leukemia cell line proliferation by reducing the expression level of RNA-binding protein human antigen R.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna519-enhances-hl60-human-acute-myeloid-leukemia-cell-line-proliferation-reducing-expression-l"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6496325,"mean":6.0089414145595,"rank":5540702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6496325,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208492,"mean":10.254122739111,"rank":165800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208492,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1684,"mean":1.3922828282828,"rank":813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1684,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":0.95721126760563,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
