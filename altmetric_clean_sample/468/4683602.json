Common sites of metastases are lungs, bone, liver, brain and adrenal glands. Metastatic disease to the head and neck ranges from 15% to 30%. The 5-year survival rate after nephrectomy is 60%-75%, but with multiorgan metastases the 5-year survival rate is significantly lower, 0-7%. A case is presented of a female patient diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma metastases to the paranasal sinuses, diagnosed and treated at the Department of ENT and Head and Neck Surgery, Zadar General Hospital, Zadar, Croatia. The tumor was surgically removed. Unfortunately, the patient died one year after the procedure due to multiorgan failure. Although metastases of renal cell carcinoma to the head and neck are very rare, it should be first suspected when investigating a metastatic tumor in this region. Surgical excision offers the best hope for long term survival. In case of unresectable tumor, other treatment options should be considered such as radiotherapy, immunotherapy and chemotherapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9173cf058f61000d0dd","authors":["Kova\u010di\u0107, Marijan","Krvavica, Ana","Rudi\u0107, Milan"],"first_seen_on":"2015-10-28T10:34:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0353-9466"],"issue":"2","journal":"Acta clinica Croatica","last_mentioned_on":1446134302,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26415321?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26415321","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"RENAL CELL CARCINOMA METASTASIS TO THE SINONASAL CAVITY: CASE REPORT.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/renal-cell-carcinoma-metastasis-sinonasal-cavity-case-report-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6504996,"mean":6.0272765079752,"rank":4571669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1694894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6504996,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207596,"mean":10.260973453118,"rank":132475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":65348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207596,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":1.4832289156627,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.34375,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
