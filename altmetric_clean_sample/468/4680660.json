This motility system is not related to those of any other bacteria or eukaryotes. M. mobile uses ATP energy to repeatedly catch, pull, and release sialylated oligosaccharides on host cells with its approximately 50-nm long legs. The gliding machinery is a large structure composed of huge surface proteins and internal jellyfish-like structure. This system may have developed from an accidental combination between an adhesin and a rotary ATPase, both of which are essential for the adhesive parasitic life of Mycoplasmas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a5","authors":["Miyata, Makoto","Hamaguchi, Tasuku"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mib.2015.08.010","first_seen_on":"2015-10-27T18:48:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0364"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1445972510,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26500189?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26500189","pubdate":"2015-10-27T22:00:54+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Prospects for the gliding mechanism of Mycoplasma mobile.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prospects-gliding-mechanism-mycoplasma-mobile"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6496325,"mean":6.0089414145595,"rank":4563867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1693925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6496325,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208492,"mean":10.254116983467,"rank":132814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":65881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208492,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":702,"mean":4.6965164051355,"rank":536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":702,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":5.7055555555556,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
