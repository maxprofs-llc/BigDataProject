The chemoresistance mechanisms are partly related to the mitochondria. Identification of the relevant proteins in mitochondria helps clarify the possible mechanisms and select effective chemotherapy for such patients. In the present study, mitochondria from two paclitaxel-sensitive human ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3 and A2780) and their corresponding resistant cell lines (SKOV3-TR and A2780-TR) were isolated. Guanidine-modified acetyl-stable isotope labelling and liquid chromatography-hybrid linear ion trap Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (LC-FTICR MS) were performed to find the expressed differential proteins. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed that 8 differentially expressed proteins in the ovarian cancer cells and their paclitaxel-resistant sublines. Among them, mimitin and 14-3-3 \u03b6\/\u03b4 were selected for further research. The effects of mimitin and 14-3-3 \u03b6\/\u03b4 were explored using specific siRNAs interference in ovarian cancer cell lines and immunohistochemistry in human tissue specimens. The down-regulation of mimitin and 14-3-3 \u03b6\/\u03b4 using specific siRNAs in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells led to increasing the resistance index to paclitaxel. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that lower expression levels of the mimitin and 14-3-3 \u03b6\/\u03b4 proteins were positively associated with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with primary ovarian cancer (mimitin: PFS: P = 0.041, OS: P = 0.003; 14-3-3 \u03b6\/\u03b4: PFS: P = 0.031, OS: P = 0.011). Mimitin and 14-3-3 protein \u03b6\/\u03b4 are potential markers of paclitaxel resistance and prognostic factors in ovarian cancer. This article is protected by copyright.
