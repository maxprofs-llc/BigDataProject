Such interactions have not been well studied for West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) and Culex spp. mosquitoes. We utilized next-generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA bacterial genes derived from Culex pipiens Linnaeus following WNV exposure and\/or infection and compared bacterial populations and broad immune responses to unexposed mosquitoes. Our results demonstrate that WNV infection increases the diversity of bacterial populations and is associated with up-regulation of classical invertebrate immune pathways including RNA interference (RNAi), Toll, and Jak-STAT (Janus kinase-Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription). In addition, WNV exposure alone, without the establishment of infection, results in similar alterations to microbial and immune signatures, although to a lesser extent. Multiple bacterial genera were found in greater abundance inWNV-exposed and\/or infected mosquitoes, yet the most consistent and notable was the genus Serratia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53b3cf058f610004704","authors":["Steven Zink"],"doi":"10.3390\/v7102886","first_seen_on":"2015-10-27T16:46:19+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["1999-4915"],"issue":"10","journal":"Viruses (1999-4915)","last_mentioned_on":1446489547,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1999-4915\/7\/10\/5619?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26516902?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1999-4915\/7\/10\/2886"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1999-4915\/7\/10\/2886\/pdf","pmid":"26516902","pubdate":"2015-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Exposure to West Nile Virus Increases Bacterial Diversity and Immune Gene Expression in Culex pipiens","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exposure-west-nile-virus-increases-bacterial-diversity-immune-gene-expression-culex-pipiens-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6520864,"mean":6.0390053006769,"rank":2659753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":3833482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6520864,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209472,"mean":10.253715139566,"rank":92260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":115856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209472,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":999,"mean":3.192378757515,"rank":384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":999,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":1.9046585365854,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
