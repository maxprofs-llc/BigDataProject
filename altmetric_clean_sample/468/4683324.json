Herein, we tested amidino-substituted benzimidazoles and benzimidazo[1,2-a]quinolines as a small platform for comparison of antitumor activity in 2D and 3D cell culture systems and correlation with structure-activity relationship. 3D cell culture method was applied on a human cancer breast (SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231, T-47D) and pancreatic cancer cells (MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1). Results obtained in 2D and 3D models were highly comparable, but in some cases we have observed significant disagreement indicating that some prominent compounds can be discarded in early phase of researching because of compounds with false positive result. To confirm which of cell culture systems is more accurate, in vivo profiling is needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fd5","authors":["Braj\u0161a, Karmen","Vujasinovi\u0107, Ines","Jeli\u0107, Dubravko","Trzun, Marija","Zlatar, Ivo","Karminski-Zamola, Grace","Hranjec, Marijana"],"doi":"10.3109\/14756366.2015.1101093","first_seen_on":"2015-10-28T10:09:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1475-6374"],"journal":"Journal of Enzyme Inhibition & Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1446026973,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26505692?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26505692","pubdate":"2015-10-28T22:00:23+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Antitumor activity of amidino-substituted benzimidazole and benzimidazo[1,2-a]quinoline derivatives tested in 2D and 3D cell culture systems.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antitumor-activity-amidinosubstituted-benzimidazole-benzimidazo12-iai-quinoline-derivatives-tested-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6500718,"mean":6.0222432796255,"rank":5544770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6500718,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207322,"mean":10.262594971083,"rank":164934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207322,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":508,"mean":0.69763313609467,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":508,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.39285714285714,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
