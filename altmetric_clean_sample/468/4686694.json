VX2 tumor tissue blocks were implanted in the left lobe of liver by percutaneous puncture under CT guidance. 2 weeks later, all rabbits underwent conventional MRI (T1WI, T2WI) to determine the successful models. Then those successfully implanted VX2 liver tumor, twenty six in the study were randomly divided into the control group and the experimental group, the former did nothing processing, and the latter underwent PEI under CT guidance. MRI (T1WI, T2WI and DCE-MRI) was performed 1 week later again, the parameters of DCE-MRI (K(trans), Kep, Ve and iAUC60) of viable tumor portions were observed. Then all the liver samples were processed for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemical staining for CD31 to determine MVD. At last, data (including DCE-MRI perfusion parameters and MVD) were compared between experimental and control group, correlation of DCE-MRI perfusion parameters and MVD were evaluated.\nTwenty six VX2 liver tumor models underwent all examinations (thirteen models for each group) 1 week later after PEI. For the experimental group, the parameters K(trans) (r = 0.6382, P = 0.0189) and iAUC60 (r = 0.6591, P = 0.0143) in viable tumor portions were positively moderately correlated with MVD, whereas the parameters Kep(r = 0.4656, P = 0.1088) and Ve (r = 0.2918, P = 0.3333) were not correlated with MVD. For the control group, the parameters K(trans)(r = 0.6385, P = 0.0188) and iAUC60(r = 0.6391, P = 0.0187) in viable tumor portions were also positively moderately correlated with MVD, while the parameters Kep (r = 0.5518, P = 0.0506) and Ve(r = -0.0824, P = 0.789) were not correlated with MVD. K(trans), Kep, Ve, iAUC60 and MVD of residual viable tumors in the experimental group 1 week later after PEI were similar to the viable tumors of the control group (P > 0.05).\nDCE-MRI could be used to evaluate the efficiency of VX2 liver tumor after PEI, The quantitative parameters K(trans) and semi- quantitative iAUC60 of DCE-MRI is correlated with MVD, which can assess tumor angiogenesis noninvasively of VX2 liver tumor model. and ethanol has no significant impact on microtubule formation of viable tumor 1 week later after PEI.(deleted).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ff3cf058f61000303d","authors":["Chen, Juan","Qian, Ting","Zhang, Huanhuan","Wei, Chunxiao","Meng, Fanhua","Yin, Huabin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mri.2015.10.013","first_seen_on":"2015-10-28T12:13:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0730725X","1873-5894"],"journal":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (0730725X)","last_mentioned_on":1446034385,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0730725X15002507&_version=1&md5=4ac0dbf5e8fdfa2526af250013383a56"],"pmid":"26518059","pubdate":"2015-11-01T22:00:45+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Combining dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and microvessel density to assess the angiogenesis after PEI in a rabbit VX2 liver tumor model ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combining-dynamic-contrast-enhanced-magnetic-resonance-imaging-microvessel-density-assess-angiogenes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6500718,"mean":6.0222432796255,"rank":3077375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1943201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6500718,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207323,"mean":10.26254185277,"rank":110941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":75317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207323,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":387,"mean":2.1568549222798,"rank":142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":387,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":1.2514705882353,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
