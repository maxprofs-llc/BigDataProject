Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is the most common form of this disease, and CL infections often result in serious skin lesions and scars. CL remains a public health problem in many endemic countries worldwide because of the absence of effective, safe, and cost-effective drugs for treatment. One of the strategies we chose to use to find novel chemical entities worthy of further development as antileishmanials involved screening synthetic and natural products libraries. In our study, we developed a Leishmania major intracellular amastigote assay that uses the activity of luciferase as a measure of parasite proliferation and used this assay to screen a collection of 400 compounds obtained from Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) for their antileishmanial activity. Our results showed that 14 compounds identified by MMV as antimalarial drugs have antileishmanial activity and can potentially be optimized for CL drug development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006990","authors":["Khraiwesh, Mozna","Leed, Susan","Roncal, Norma","Johnson, Jacob","Sciotti, Richard","Smith, Philip","Read, Lisa","Paris, Robert","Hudson, Thomas","Hickman, Mark","Grogl, Max","Mozna Khraiwesh","Susan Leed","Norma Roncal","Jacob Johnson","Richard Sciotti","Philip Smith","Lisa Read","Robert Paris","Thomas Hudson","Mark Hickman","Max Grogl"],"doi":"10.4269\/ajtmh.15-0448","endpage":"347","first_seen_on":"2015-10-28T10:06:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-1645","0002-9637"],"issue":"2","journal":"The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","last_mentioned_on":1473724800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26503273?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26503273?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26503273","http:\/\/www.ajtmh.org\/content\/94\/2\/340.long","http:\/\/www.ajtmh.org\/content\/94\/2\/340.short","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4269\/ajtmh.15-0448"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajtmh.org\/content\/94\/2\/340.full.pdf","pmid":"26503273","pubdate":"2015-10-28T22:01:16+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"340","title":"Antileishmanial Activity of Compounds Derived from the Medicines for Malaria Venture Open Access Box Against Intracellular Leishmania major Amastigotes.","type":"article","volume":"94","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antileishmanial-activity-compounds-derived-medicines-malaria-venture-open-access-box-against-intrace"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":920436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7433379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245632,"mean":9.7870671942873,"rank":36825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":208190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245632,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4480,"mean":5.2560196472427,"rank":273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4480,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":7.4286382978723,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":11,"researcher":1,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":11,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
