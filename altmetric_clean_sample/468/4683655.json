Foci of endometriosis proliferate under estrogen stimulation, like normal endometrium. We present a patient under estradiol stimulation for a history of endometrial cancer who underwent a PET\/CT scan to assess an abdominal lesion showing a high F-FDG uptake, which normalized under progesterone hormonal replacement and cessation of estradiol. Two consecutive biopsies confirmed endometriosis. F-FDG evaluation of endometriosis under estrogen stimulation could be a promising approach to refractory endometriosis assessment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f10","authors":["Arsenault, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","Turcotte, \u00c9ric"],"doi":"10.1097\/rlu.0000000000001050","first_seen_on":"2015-10-28T10:44:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-0229"],"journal":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1446057183,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26505859?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26505859?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26505859","pubdate":"2015-10-28T22:00:21+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Endometriosis Under Estradiol Stimulation Imaged Using 18F-FDG and Its Control After Estradiol Cessation and Progesterone Hormonal Replacement.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endometriosis-under-estradiol-stimulation-imaged-using-18ffdg-control-after-estradiol-cessation-prog"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6500718,"mean":6.0222432796255,"rank":2878358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3448072,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6500718,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207323,"mean":10.262514118135,"rank":100999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":97584,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207323,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2147,"mean":0.92431314072693,"rank":376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":1640,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2147,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":1.16125,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/molecularimging\/statuses\/659319758177763328","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4683655],"posted_on":"2015-10-28T10:44:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Molecular Imaging","url":"http:\/\/www.medjournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1081930767\/fdg_normal.PNG","description":"PET\/CT, MRI, CT, and other molecular imaging news and updates.
