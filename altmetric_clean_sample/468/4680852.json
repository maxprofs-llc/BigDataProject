Using the previously proposed method, the contribution of such a recovery in radiation sensitivity of diploid yeast cells of different strains after exposure to ionizing and ultraviolet radiation has been estimated. It is shown that the actual increase in cell radiosensitivity significantly exceeds the expected one in the case of inhibition of the recovery from potentially lethal damage. These data indicate that inhibition of cell ability to recover from potentially lethal radiation damage by exposing the irradiated cells in non-nutritive medium in many cases serve as an indicator of suppression of the overall ability of cells to repair. Experimental data indicating that it is not a universal rule are presented.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa91a3cf058f61000d2ec","authors":["Evstratova, E S","Petin, V G"],"first_seen_on":"2015-10-27T19:42:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0041-3771"],"issue":"6","journal":"Tsitologiia","last_mentioned_on":1445974937,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26495708?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26495708","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"[INCREASE IN CELL RADIOSENSITIVITY AFTER INHIBITION OF CELL ABILITY TO RECOVER FROM POTENTIALLY LETHAL RADIATION DAMAGE].","type":"article","volume":"57"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6496325,"mean":6.0089414145595,"rank":5540701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6496325,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208493,"mean":10.254074755866,"rank":165800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208493,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":1.0621265822785,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/statuses\/659092776567439360","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4680852],"posted_on":"2015-10-27T19:42:17+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
