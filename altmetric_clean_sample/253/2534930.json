The new taxon exhibits autapomorphic characters for the Saprininae subfamily and is unusual especially for its large and deep prosternal foveae and the shape of spiculum gastrale. The description is accompanied by color habitus images, SEM micrographs, mouthparts and antenna line drawings and drawings of the male genitalia. Key to the genera of the Saprininae of Madagascar and the adjacent archipelagos is given. Hypocaccus (Baeckmanniolus) rubiciliae (Lewis, 1899) is newly reported from Madagascar and Hypocaccus (Nessus) perparvulus (Desbordes, 1916) is new to Mauritius.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53d3cf058f610004744","authors":["Tom\u00e1\u0161 Lackner","Yves Gomy"],"doi":"10.3897\/zookeys.427.4799","first_seen_on":"2014-07-24T09:41:35+00:00","issns":["1313-2970","1313-2989"],"issue":"427","journal":"ZooKeys","last_mentioned_on":1502755200,"links":["http:\/\/www.pensoft.net\/journals\/zookeys\/article\/4799\/abstract\/sarandibrinus-a-new-genus-of-saprininae-subfamily-from-madagascar-coleoptera-histeridae-second%C2%A0contribution-to-the-know","http:\/\/www.pensoft.net\/journals\/zookeys\/article\/4799\/abstract\/sarandibrinus-a-new-genus-of-saprininae-subfamily-from-madagascar-coleoptera-histeridae-second%C2%A0contribution-to-the-know)","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3897\/zookeys.427.4799"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pensoft.net\/inc\/journals\/download.php?fileTable=J_GALLEYS&fileId=8868","pmcid":"PMC4137315","pmid":"25147466","publisher":"Pensoft Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Sarandibrinus, a new genus of Saprininae subfamily from Madagascar (Coleoptera, Histeridae) (Second\u00a0contribution to the knowledge of\u00a0the\u00a0Histeridae of Madagascar)","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sarandibrinus-new-genus-saprininae-subfamily-madagascar-coleoptera-histeridae-second-contribution-kn"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.25,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8373007,"mean":7.0576589951014,"rank":837316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7528038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8373007,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181379,"mean":7.6854829031087,"rank":21037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":160163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181379,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2496,"mean":15.986115430862,"rank":591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":1905,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2496,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":17.358866666667,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=700337326706830&id=147577228649512","license":"public","citation_ids":[2534930],"posted_on":"2014-07-23T21:25:22+00:00","summary":"New genus of beetle has recently been descried from the Mahavelo forest Ifotaka.
