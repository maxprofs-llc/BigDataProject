The influenza nonstructural (NS) gene is critical for a virus to counteract the antiviral responses of the host. Therefore, a newly acquired NS segment potentially determines the replication efficiency of the reassortant virus in a range of different hosts. In addition, the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (PBM) has been suggested as a pathogenic determinant of IAVs. To gauge the pandemic potential from human and avian IAV reassortment, we assessed the replication properties of NS-reassorted viruses in cultured cells and in the lungs of mice and determined their transmissibility in guinea pigs. Compared with the recombinant A\/Korea\/01\/2009 virus (rK09; 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain), the rK09\/VN:NS virus, in which the NS gene was adopted from the A\/Vietnam\/1203\/2004 virus (a human isolate of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus strains), exhibited attenuated virulence and reduced transmissibility. However, the rK09\/VN:NS-PBM virus, harboring the PBM in the C-terminus of the NS1 protein, recovered the attenuated virulence of the rK09\/VN:NS virus. In a guinea pig model, the rK09\/VN:NS-PBM virus showed even greater transmission efficiency than the rK\/09 virus. These results suggest that the PBM in the NS1 protein may determine viral persistence in the human and avian IAV interface.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Kim JI","Hwang MW","Lee I","Park S","Lee S","Bae JY","Heo J","Kim D","Jang SI","Park MS","Kwon HJ","Song JW"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2014.04.132","first_seen_on":"2014-07-23T16:02:04+00:00","issns":["0006-291X"],"issue":"","journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1406144083,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24802398?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24802398","pubdate":"2014-05-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"The PDZ-binding motif of the avian NS1 protein affects transmission of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pdzbinding-motif-avian-ns1-protein-affects-transmission-2009-influenza-ah1n1-virus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3055484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109737,"mean":8.0173993766861,"rank":72805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":26192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109737,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7474,"mean":2.1370764084036,"rank":5142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1860,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7474,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125,"mean":0.98588709677419,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
