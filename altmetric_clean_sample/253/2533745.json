This rare presentation of an infection in a lumbar facet joint occurred after minor trauma sustained in a football game. Septic arthritis of the spinal facet joint is an uncommon phenomenon. Only 5 cases have been reported in immunocompromised pediatric patients. To our knowledge, no case of septic arthritis in an immunocompetent pediatric patient has been reported. An otherwise healthy 16-year-old boy presented with 4 weeks of escalating back pain after a minor athletics-related trauma. Evaluation showed incapacitating pain, lumbar musculature spasms, and the absence of fever, hemodynamic, or neurologic changes. Laboratory values were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance images showed a fluid collection within the L3-L4 facet and a localized abscess. Computed tomographic-guided aspiration showed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, for which the patient received 6 weeks of vancomycin with complete resolution of symptoms. Refractory lumbago in an adolescent requires careful evaluation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006987","authors":["Dean N Papaliodis","Timothy T Roberts","Nicholas G Richardson","James B Lawrence"],"first_seen_on":"2014-07-23T22:32:56+00:00","issns":["1934-3418"],"issue":"7","journal":"The American Journal of Orthopedics","last_mentioned_on":1408820741,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25046186?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25046186","pubdate":"2014-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Spontaneous Septic Arthritis of the Lumbar Facet Caused by Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus in an Otherwise Healthy Adolescent.","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spontaneous-septic-arthritis-lumbar-facet-caused-methicillinresistant-staphylococcus-aureus-otherwis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5360788,"mean":6.2729937727452,"rank":2660749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2538901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5360788,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131603,"mean":8.4354968313553,"rank":60344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":66307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131603,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":1.6847433628319,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.175,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
