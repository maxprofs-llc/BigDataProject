The purpose of this current opinion is to provide an evolutionary overview of sarcopenia research since 1989. This includes the creation of an operational definition of sarcopenia; consideration of the impacts of sarcopenia on physical function, chronic disease, and mortality risk; the distinction between the process of sarcopenia and the process of age-related loss of muscle strength, a phenomenon that has recently been termed dynapenia; a comparison of the independent effects of sarcopenia and dynapenia on physical function, chronic disease, and mortality risk; and consideration of the combined influence of sarcopenia and dynapenia with obesity (i.e., sarcopenic-obesity and dynapenic-obesity) on physical function, chronic disease, and mortality risk.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000ceb","authors":["Janssen I"],"doi":"10.1139\/h10-067","first_seen_on":"2014-07-22T19:59:19+00:00","issns":["1715-5312","1715-5320"],"issue":"5","journal":"Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1465324965,"links":["http:\/\/www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1139\/H10-067","http:\/\/www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1139\/H10-067"],"pmid":"20962927","pubdate":"2010-10-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology","metabolism","sportsmedicine","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Evolution of sarcopenia research.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evolution-sarcopenia-research"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.914,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.914},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7866440,"mean":6.6628832942016,"rank":909215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":6957230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7866440,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179040,"mean":7.4727619792338,"rank":23329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":155708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179040,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1104,"mean":13.686977334542,"rank":312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":792,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1104,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":35.79336,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
