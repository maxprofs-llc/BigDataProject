In the present study, we have employed three-dimensional graphene foams as culture substrates for human mesenchymal stem cells and provide evidence that these materials can maintain stem cell viability and promote osteogenic differentiation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000823d","authors":["Spencer W.
