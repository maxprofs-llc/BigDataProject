However, it is difficult to find a suitable solvent and solution process for most semiconductors. For example, metal phthalocyanines (MPcs) are only soluble in non-volatile solvents, which prevent their applications from solution process. For the first time, vectorial diffusion is utilized for solution processing of MPcs. The obtained large F16 CuPc and \u03b1-phase CuPc crystals and the efficient phase separation of them suggest the vectorial diffusion process is as slow as a self-assembly process, which is helpful to yield large crystals and purify the semiconductors. This method, which only uses common commercial solvents without any complex and expensive instruments and high-temperature operation, provides a facile approach for purification of organic semiconductors and growth of their crystals in large quantities.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Chengliang Wang","Yaoguo Fang","Liaoyong Wen","Min Zhou","Yang Xu","Huaping Zhao","Luisa De Cola","Wenping Hu","Yong Lei","Wang, Chengliang","Fang, Yaoguo","Wen, Liaoyong","Zhou, Min","Xu, Yang","Zhao, Huaping","De\u2005Cola, Luisa","Hu, Wenping","Lei, Yong"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201403702","endpage":"10995","first_seen_on":"2014-07-25T10:26:58+00:00","issns":["1521-3765","0947-6539"],"issue":"35","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1408750531,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25056403?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201403702\/abstract;jsessionid=432C03F43068C0545B6ACAF8544DDE04.f01t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201403702\/pdf","pmid":"25056403","pubdate":"2014-07-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"10990","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Vectorial Diffusion for Facile Solution\u2010Processed Self\u2010Assembly of Insoluble Semiconductors: A Case Study on Metal Phthalocyanines","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vectorial-diffusion-facile-solutionprocessed-selfassembly-insoluble-semiconductors-case-study-metal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6314681,"mean":5.9745133992544,"rank":4437408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1649064,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6314681,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145752,"mean":8.0017356724827,"rank":90430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":49148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145752,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2515,"mean":3.8277939538584,"rank":1409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2515,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":3.516112,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Der_Maze\/status\/502962299926093824","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2538700],"posted_on":"2014-08-22T23:35:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Der Maze","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"Der_Maze","tweeter_id":"1143898112","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":10},"tweet_id":"502962299926093824"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/assembly_papers\/status\/492616720578650112","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2538700],"posted_on":"2014-07-25T10:25:53+00:00","author":{"name":"assemblypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439371508528320512\/TDJfUNti_normal.png","description":"Papers on directed and self assembly","id_on_source":"assembly_papers","tweeter_id":"2364079946","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":332},"tweet_id":"492616720578650112"}]}}
