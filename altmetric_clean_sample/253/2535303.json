The dental remains were found in a sedimentary layer representing a calm depositional environment within a freshwater spring system. The corresponding archaeological context comprises a Middle Palaeolithic faunal and lithic assemblage that represents the last documented evidence of human occupation at the site, dating to between 47.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.4 and 45.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4\u00a0ka (thousands of years ago). This evidence is overlain by an archaeologically sterile deposit dated to 44.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\u00a0ka. Results show that the teeth belong to a single juvenile or young adult individual with morphological and metric features falling within the Neanderthal range of variability, although the considered traits are not taxonomically highly discriminant. The reported fossils are representative of the latest Middle Palaeolithic groups in the region and may be considered in the ongoing debate on the disappearance of Neanderthals and the end of the Middle Palaeolithic.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002de3","doi":"10.1016\/j.jhevol.2014.02.019","first_seen_on":"2014-07-24T11:16:02+00:00","issns":["00472484"],"journal":"Journal of Human Evolution","last_mentioned_on":1425206580,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0047248414001043"],"pmid":"25063566","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Anthropology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Archaeology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Neanderthals from El Salt (Alcoy, Spain) in the context of the latest Middle Palaeolithic populations from the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neanderthals-el-salt-alcoy-spain-context-latest-middle-palaeolithic-populations-southeast-iberian-pe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.33,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.33},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4818502,"mean":5.7547643846114,"rank":494053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":4324340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4818502,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118817,"mean":8.3669418428496,"rank":15925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":102891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118817,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":956,"mean":11.485907853403,"rank":272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":956,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":5.065,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
