To assess the accuracy of \"morphine\" and \"codeine\" listings on death certificates for unintentional overdose deaths in Allegheny County, PA, investigative and laboratory reports were reviewed. Deaths were reclassified as heroin-related if documentation showed 6-monoacetylmorphine in blood or urine, \"stamp bags\" or drug paraphernalia at scene, history of heroin use, or track marks. Deaths were considered morphine-related if notes indicated morphine use, prescription, or morphine at scene, or codeine-related if the codeine blood level exceeded morphine. Of 112 deaths with morphine but not heroin listed on the death certificate, 74 met heroin criteria and 21 morphine criteria. Of 20 deaths with both morphine and heroin listed, only one met morphine criteria. Of 34 deaths with codeine listed, only five were attributed to codeine. Consideration of patient history, death scene evidence, and expanded toxicology testing may improve the accuracy of death certificate drug listings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db2","authors":["Mertz KJ","Janssen JK","Williams KE"],"doi":"10.1111\/1556-4029.12541","first_seen_on":"2014-07-25T12:05:16+00:00","issns":["0022-1198"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Forensic Sciences (Blackwell Publishing Limited)","last_mentioned_on":1408320622,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25041514"],"pmid":"25041514","pubdate":"2014-07-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["jurisprudence"],"title":"Underrepresentation of Heroin Involvement in Unintentional Drug Overdose Deaths in Allegheny County, PA.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/underrepresentation-heroin-involvement-unintentional-drug-overdose-deaths-allegheny-county-pa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2317391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2591914,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125980,"mean":8.3095472261252,"rank":52042,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":69876,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125980,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1216,"mean":3.8863917695473,"rank":545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1216,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":4.496875,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
