Thirty-four men with primary or secondary hypogonadism were enrolled in the study; 31 men were included in the pharmacokinetics (PKs) population. Testosterone 2% gel (40\u2009mg) was applied once daily in the morning to the front and inner thighs for 14 days. Median gel drying time was 2.4\u2009min (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7-3.4\u2009min; n=31). Serum TT concentrations reached the target eugonadal range with a median time of 2.9\u2009h (95% CI, 1.9-4.3\u2009h; n=24). Median time to steady-state serum TT concentration was 1.1 days (95% CI, 0.7-3.4 days; n=31). Six patients (17.6%; n=34) reported treatment-related adverse events; all were mild. The results from this 14-day PK study in men with hypogonadism suggest that testosterone 2% gel dries, on average, in <3\u2009min after application and that testosterone 2% gel rapidly reaches the target eugonadal range and attains steady-state serum TT concentrations in about 1 day.International Journal of Impotence Research advance online publication, 24 July 2014; doi:10.1038\/ijir.2014.28.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b60","authors":["A Morgentaler","J McGettigan","Q Xiang","T M Danoff","E M Gould"],"doi":"10.1038\/ijir.2014.28","first_seen_on":"2014-07-25T10:03:12+00:00","issns":["0955-9930","1476-5489"],"journal":"International Journal of Impotence Research","last_mentioned_on":1406282576,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ijir\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/ijir201428a.html"],"pmid":"25056809","pubdate":"2014-07-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Pharmacokinetics and drying time of testosterone 2|[percnt]| gel in men with hypogonadism: a multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacokinetics-drying-time-testosterone-2-gel-men-hypogonadism-multicenter-openlabel-singlearm-tri"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4075440,"mean":5.0834589676396,"rank":3089860,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":813844,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4075440,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101523,"mean":7.9851825023148,"rank":76558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":20598,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101523,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246,"mean":5.2247265306122,"rank":198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":4.0333333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
