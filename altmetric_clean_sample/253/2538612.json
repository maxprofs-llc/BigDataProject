The necessity of initiating anticoagulant therapy in a patient with an epidural catheter requires a careful weighing up between thromboembolic complications and epidural hematoma. The case presented here of a 47-year-old female patient who was operated on for mastectomy with a latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap demonstrates a possible solution to this dilemma. The patient sustained a perioperative ST elevation myocardial infarction treated with drug-eluting stents while undergoing epidural pain therapy. By using the short-acting antiplatelet drug tirofiban over a time period of 7 days the gap for dual antiplatelet therapy was reduced with the help of specific platelet aggregation assays to a time frame of a few hours to minimize the risk of stent thrombosis. The epidural catheter was removed without complications under consideration of the current recommendations for regional anesthesia and antithrombotic agents.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cc3cf058f610000481","authors":["H B\u00f6hle","J Fr\u00f6hlich","R Laufenberg-Feldmann"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00101-014-2358-z","first_seen_on":"2014-07-25T10:16:17+00:00","issns":["1432-055X"],"journal":"Anaesthesist","last_mentioned_on":1406282652,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25056411?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25056411","pubdate":"2014-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"[Risk consideration for peridural catheter removal in acute coronary syndrome : Epidural hematoma versus stent thrombosis.]","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risikoabw%C3%A4gung-vor-periduralkatheterentfernung-bei-akutem-koronarsyndrom"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4075440,"mean":5.0834589676396,"rank":3261754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":101047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4075440,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101529,"mean":7.9817475573242,"rank":80927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101529,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258,"mean":1.2893929961089,"rank":131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.79545454545455,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/status\/492611265634643968","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2538612],"posted_on":"2014-07-25T10:04:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
