A total of 529 preadolescents (247 boys, 46.69%) were recruited from an Italian middle school (Mage=12 years and 7 months; SD=1 year and 2 months). The participants primarily consisted of Italian children (91.12%). A series of binary logistic regression analyses parted by gender were conducted to examine the main and interactive effects of self-reported emotion-related variables and peer-reported social standing in the prediction of self-reported cyberbullying behaviors, while controlling for cyber victimization and grade effects. In girls, an uncaring disposition was directly associated with cyberbullying behaviors, whereas in boys this association only emerged for those with low perceived popularity. Our results indicated that, in developing anti(cyber)bullying programs, school researchers and practitioners should jointly consider individual and contextual factors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c1","authors":["Enrica Ciucci","Andrea Baroncelli"],"doi":"10.1089\/cyber.2014.0020","first_seen_on":"2014-07-24T18:02:06+00:00","issns":["2152-2723"],"journal":"CyberPsychology, Behavior & Social Networking","last_mentioned_on":1431224914,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25055248?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25055248","pubdate":"2014-07-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","psychology"],"title":"Emotion-Related Personality Traits and Peer Social Standing: Unique and Interactive Effects in Cyberbullying Behaviors.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emotionrelated-personality-traits-peer-social-standing-unique-interactive-effects-cyberbullying-beha"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5076526,"mean":6.0149281329265,"rank":2681561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1732640,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5076526,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128098,"mean":8.274614503072,"rank":63937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":48957,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128098,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":594,"mean":21.592779089376,"rank":433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":594,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":29.944111111111,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
