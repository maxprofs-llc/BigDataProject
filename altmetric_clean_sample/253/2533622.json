Hand rubbing with an alcohol-based handrub, is the most efficient and popular method. We found in several case studies that 3 minutes of dry hand rubbing without any disinfectant decreases the number of hand bacteria. In this study of 54 samples taken from 47 test subjects, we tried to determine how effectively this method decreases hand bacterial numbers. Except for 12 samples that were indeterminate, the number of hand bacteria in 36 (85.7%) out of 42 samples decreased. The average rate of decrease was 49.4% and the maximum rate was 98.3%. Although the most effective duration of dry hand rubbing varied among individuals, we estimated that 2 minutes is optimal. As dry hand rubbing without disinfectants decreases hand bacteria, we suggest that it can be an effective alternate method in emergency situations when water, soap or disinfectants are unavailable.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd10","authors":["Hira D","Ogawa M","Ishii T","Gono K","Sakamoto T","Yamamura S","Masumoto N","Yasutomi M","You C","Fukuda K","Taniguchi H"],"first_seen_on":"2014-07-23T21:13:04+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of UOEH","last_mentioned_on":1406149958,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24633181"],"pmid":"24633181","pubdate":"2014-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","occupationalmedicine"],"title":"A study of the bacterial reduction effects of dry hand rubbing without disinfectant.","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/study-bacterial-reduction-effects-dry-hand-rubbing-without-disinfectant"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4057236,"mean":5.0662145099224,"rank":2274323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1041841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4057236,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101216,"mean":7.9524884651485,"rank":54334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":26561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101216,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.846,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/roxroxhaha\/status\/492054705170706433","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2533622],"posted_on":"2014-07-23T21:12:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Roxanne Nottingham","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3576045782\/cb2a97f22ca77cb95006afcae4872122_normal.jpeg","description":"punctilious lab geek, rice connoisseur,  secret spice girl.","id_on_source":"roxroxhaha","tweeter_id":"1381269283","followers":10},"tweet_id":"492054705170706433"}]}}
