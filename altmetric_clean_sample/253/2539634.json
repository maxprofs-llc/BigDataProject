The number of patients that undergo radiation as a part of their therapy regimen is only increasing every year, but this does not come without cost. As this number increases, so too does the incidence of secondary, radiation-induced neoplasias, creating a need for therapeutic agents targeted specifically towards incidence reduction and treatment of these cancers. Development and efficacy testing of these agents requires not only extensive in vitro testing but also a set of reliable animal models to accurately recreate the complex situations of radiation-induced carcinogenesis. As radiation-induced leukemic progression often involves genomic changes such as rearrangements, deletions, and changes in methylation, the laboratory mouse Mus musculus, with its fully sequenced genome, is a powerful tool in cancer research. This fact, combined with the molecular and physiological similarities it shares with man and its small size and high rate of breeding in captivity, makes it the most relevant model to use in radiation-induced leukemia research. In this work, we review relevant M. musculus inbred and F1 hybrid animal models, as well as methods of induction of radiation-induced myeloid leukemia. Associated molecular pathologies are also included.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007679","doi":"10.1186\/1479-7364-8-13","first_seen_on":"2014-07-25T16:21:11+00:00","issns":["1479-7364"],"issue":"1","journal":"Human Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1406305219,"links":["http:\/\/www.humgenomics.com\/content\/pdf\/1479-7364-8-13.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.humgenomics.com\/content\/pdf\/1479-7364-8-13.pdf","pmid":"25062865","pubdate":"2014-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"13","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Radiation-induced myeloid leukemia in murine models","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/radiationinduced-myeloid-leukemia-murine-models"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":3551065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":838433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126029,"mean":8.3057899831786,"rank":84453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":24551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126029,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":4.3786728971963,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":6.57,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
