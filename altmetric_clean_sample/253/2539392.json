Indeed, the CCSD(T)-F12\/aug-cc-pVTZ 2D-PES for linear C3 and the CCSD(T)-F12\/aug-cc-pVTZ 4D-PES for bent C3 configurations gently approach those mapped at the CCSD(T)\/aug-cc-pVXZ (X = T,Q) + bond functions level, whereas a strong reduction of computational effort is observed. After exact dynamical computations, the pattern of the rovibrational levels of the intermediate C3-He complex and the rotational and rovibrational (de-) excitation of C3 by He derived using both sets of PESs agree quite well. Since C3 shows a floppy character, the interaction PES is defined in four dimensions to obtain realistic collisional parameters. The C-C-C bending mode, which fundamental lies at 63 cm(-1) and can be excited at very low temperatures is explicitly considered as independent coordinate. Our work suggests hence that CCSD(T)-F12\/aug-cc-pVTZ methodology is the key method for the generation of accurate polyatomic - He\/H2 multi-dimensional PESs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cee","authors":["M.
