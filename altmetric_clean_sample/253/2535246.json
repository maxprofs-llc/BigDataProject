In this chapter, we will describe two different types of assays that can be used to monitor Notch activation in Kc167 and S2 cells. One involves activating Notch in cultured cells and measuring the change in endogenous gene expression levels. The other uses luciferase reporters and measures their response to Notch, by co-transfecting with NICD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","aggregated_in":[],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Jinghua Li","Benjamin E Housden","Sarah J Bray","Li J","Housden BE","Bray SJ","Li, Jinghua","Housden, Benjamin E.","Bray, Sarah J."],"book":{"isbns":["9781493911387","9781493911394"]},"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-1139-4_10","first_seen_on":"2014-07-24T10:56:29+00:00","funders":["bbsrc","mrc"],"issns":["1940-6029","1064-3745"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1406224800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25053486?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25053486"],"pmid":"25053486","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Notch signaling assays in Drosophila cultured cell lines.","type":"chapter","volume":"1187","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/notch-signaling-assays-drosophila-cultured-cell-lines"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.43,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.43},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7387178,"mean":6.4186252688908,"rank":865160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":6521626,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7387178,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176187,"mean":7.3713055520872,"rank":23580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":152604,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176187,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5030,"mean":1.69973513621,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":4851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5030,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":0.56842105263158,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
