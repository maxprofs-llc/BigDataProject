To explore the context of incidence of and associated risk factors for pressure ulcers amongst the population of surgical patients. Methods. The initial study cohort was conducted with a total of 297 patients admitted to a teaching hospital for a surgical operation from November 14th to 27th 2006 in Taipei, Taiwan. The Braden scale, pressure ulcers record sheet, and perioperative patient outcomes free from signs and symptoms of injury related to positioning and related nursing interventions and activities were collected. Results. The incidence of immediate and thirty-minute-later pressure ulcers is 9.8% (29\/297) and 5.1% (15\/297), respectively. Using logistic regression model, the statistically significantly associated risk factors related to immediate and thirty-minute-later pressure ulcers include operation age, type of anesthesia, type of operation position, type of surgery, admission Braden score, and number of nursing intervention after adjustment for confounding factors. Conclusion. Admission Braden score and number of nursing intervention are well-established protected factors for the development of pressure ulcers. Our study shows that older operation age, type of anesthesia, type of operation position, and type of surgery are also associated with the development of pressure ulcers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Ling Fu Shaw","Pao-Chu Chang","Jung-Fen Lee","Huei-Yu Kung","Tao-Hsin Tung"],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/416896","first_seen_on":"2014-07-25T10:05:25+00:00","issns":["2314-6141"],"journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1444385945,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25057484?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25057484","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Incidence and predicted risk factors of pressure ulcers in surgical patients: experience at a medical center in taipei, taiwan.","type":"article","volume":"2014","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/incidence-predicted-risk-factors-pressure-ulcers-surgical-patients-experience-medical-center-taipei-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6243979,"mean":5.9569076207533,"rank":5306364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6243979,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135895,"mean":8.2960719384227,"rank":108604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135895,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3745,"mean":2.627733974359,"rank":2535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3745,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146,"mean":2.5207448275862,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
