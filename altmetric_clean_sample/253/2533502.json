They also decrease the synthesis of isoprenoid molecules, such as the side chain of ubiquinone and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. As a consequence, statins impair mitochondrial metabolism and the activation of small monomeric GTPases (such as Rho and Ras), causing toxic effects. To date, a successful strategy to prevent statin toxicity is lacking.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002450","authors":["Campia I","Lussiana C","Pescarmona G","Ghigo D","Bosia A","Riganti C"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1476-5381.2009.00465.x","first_seen_on":"2014-07-23T20:00:55+00:00","issns":["0007-1188"],"issue":"7","journal":"British Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1406146072,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19888963"],"pmcid":"PMC2801219","pmid":"19888963","pubdate":"2009-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Geranylgeraniol prevents the cytotoxic effects of mevastatin in THP-1 cells, without decreasing the beneficial effects on cholesterol synthesis.","type":"article","volume":"158","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/geranylgeraniol-prevents-cytotoxic-effects-mevastatin-thp1-cells-without-decreasing-beneficial-effec"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4057236,"mean":5.0662145099224,"rank":1896742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2130633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4057236,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101216,"mean":7.9524884651485,"rank":42452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":57859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101216,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1868,"mean":3.5337204070702,"rank":1046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1868,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":7.8217391304348,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
