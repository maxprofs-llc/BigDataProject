Therefore, an update was necessary, to provide healthcare professionals up-to-date guidelines and study therapeutic desescalation in particular.\nThe clinical practice guidelines development process is based on systematic literature review and critical appraisal by a multidisciplinary experts workgroup. The recommendations are thus based on the best available evidence and experts agreement. Prior to publication, the guidelines are also reviewed by more than 100\u00a0independent practitioners in cancer care delivery.\nThis article presents French guidelines about MRI and vacuum assisted breast biopsy indications for DCIS diagnosis and the management of low-grade DCIS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069f6","authors":["Cutuli, Bruno","Tunon De Lara, Christine","Arnaud, Antoine","Bertheau, Philippe","Boulanger, Lo\u00efc","Boute, V\u00e9ronique","Ceugnart, Luc","Chauvet, Marie-Pierre","Coutant, Charles","De Cremoux, Patricia","Fourquet, Alain","Hennequin, Christophe","Lesieur, Audrey","Lesur, Anne","L\u00e9vy, Laurent","Vincent-Salomon, Anne","Besnard, St\u00e9phanie","Belorgey, Chantal"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.annpat.2016.03.012","first_seen_on":"2016-05-30T10:31:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0242-6498","02426498"],"issue":"3","journal":"Annales de Pathologie (ScienceDirect)","last_mentioned_on":1464603614,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27236350?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27236350","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Diagnostic du carcinome canalaire in situ\u00a0: 3\u00a0recommandations nationales fran\u00e7aises","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diagnostic-du-carcinome-canalaire-situ-3-recommandations-nationales-fran%C3%A7aises"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7831397,"mean":6.6382928244153,"rank":6783192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7831397,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269127,"mean":11.359046810787,"rank":224189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269127,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":0.67784810126582,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.5625,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/737227108942893056","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8374038],"posted_on":"2016-05-30T10:20:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"737227108942893056"}]}}
