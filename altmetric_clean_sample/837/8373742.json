M morganii isolates were subjected to antibiotic resistance tests using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) technique and an antibiogram was produced. Molecular studies were conducted using the polymerase chain reaction technique.\nMinimum inhibitory concentration.\nFrom 395 gram-negative bacteria, only 17 isolates M morganii grew on MacConkey agar. M morganii isolates strongly resistant to several antibiotics were considered multidrug resistant. All M morganii isolates were ESBL producers. Four genes (CTX-M, SHV, TEM and OXA) encoding the b-lactamase enzyme were detected. Meropenem and imipenem were highly active against the M morganii isolates.\nAll isolates showed resistance to most common antibiotics, which limits options for treatment. This study provided useful information for selecting antibiotics to precisely target infections caused by M morganii.\nLimited to antibiotic susceptibility and genotype.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005729","authors":["Al-Muhanna, Abbas S","Al-Muhanna, Sddiq","Alzuhairi, Maytham A"],"doi":"10.5144\/0256-4947.2016.223","first_seen_on":"2016-05-30T10:28:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0975-4466"],"issue":"3","journal":"Annals of Saudi Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1464604825,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27236395?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27236395?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27236395","pubdate":"2016-05-30T22:00:18+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Molecular investigation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes and potential drug resistance in clinical isolates of Morganella morganii.","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-investigation-extended-spectrum-betalactamase-genes-potential-drug-resistance-clinical-iso"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7831397,"mean":6.6382928244153,"rank":6783194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7831397,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269127,"mean":11.35904773972,"rank":224189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269127,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286,"mean":3.0245684210526,"rank":232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
