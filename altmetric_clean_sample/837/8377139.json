Gene expression was statistically correlated according to the grade, the stage, tobacco consumption, the BCG response and disease severity.\nT-bet levels in patients with high-grade bladder cancer were significantly elevated compared to patients with low- or medium-grade bladder cancer (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). In invasive carcinoma (T2-T4), the T-bet levels were significantly higher than in superficial non-invasive bladder tumors (Tis, Ta, and T1) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). However, T-bet is predictive of the response to BCG. Its expression is high in good responders to BCG (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). In contrast, the expression of GATA-3 and Bcl-6 in non-invasive carcinoma (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.0003) and in patients with low- and medium-grade cancers (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) is significantly higher than in invasive bladder tumors and in patients with high-grade bladder carcinoma, respectively. In addition, heavy smokers, whose tumors express low levels of GATA-3 and Bcl-6, are poor responders to BCG (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Finally, better patient survival correlated with GATA-3 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and Bcl-6 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) but not T-bet expression.\nOur results suggest that T-bet expression in bladder tumors could be a positive prognostic indicator of BCG therapy, even if high levels are found in high-grade and stage of the disease. However, GATA-3 and Bcl-6 expression could be considered as predictive factors for good patient survival.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000865","authors":["Islem Ben Bahria-Sediki","Islem Ben Bahria-Sediki","Nadhir Yousfi","Catherine Paul","Mohamed Chebil","Mohamed Cherif","Rachida Zermani","Amel Ben Ammar El Gaaied","Ali Bettaieb"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12967-016-0891-z","first_seen_on":"2016-05-30T15:22:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1479-5876"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Translational Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1464621527,"links":["http:\/\/translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12967-016-0891-z?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed:%20JournalOfTranslationalMedicine-LatestArticles%20(Journal%20of%20Translational%20Medicine)"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12967-016-0891-z?site=http:\/\/translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC4885121","pmid":"27237631","pubdate":"2016-05-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Clinical significance of T-bet, GATA-3, and Bcl-6 transcription factor expression in bladder carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-significance-tbet-gata3-bcl6-transcription-factor-expression-bladder-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7831397,"mean":6.6382928244153,"rank":4100784,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2181973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7831397,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269128,"mean":11.358973949102,"rank":145850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269128,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1768,"mean":5.4445523486135,"rank":994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1768,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113,"mean":11.277017857143,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/evidknowlcentre\/statuses\/737302242085179397","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8377139],"posted_on":"2016-05-30T15:18:47+00:00","author":{"name":"ekc-nwcsu","url":"http:\/\/www.evidenceknowledgecentre.info","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/519868569585086465\/Ubj9_r3m_normal.png","description":"Evidence Services at North West CSU","id_on_source":"evidknowlcentre","tweeter_id":"1263882180","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":73},"tweet_id":"737302242085179397"}]}}
