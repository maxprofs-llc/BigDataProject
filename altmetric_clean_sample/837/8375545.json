At that time little evidence regarding epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic work-up, treatment strategies and follow-up was available. Consequently the criteria for the clinical entities were more experience than evidence based. In the past decade, new insights have been gained in the different FGIDs in these age groups. Based on those, further revisions have been made to the criteria. The description of infant colic has been expanded to include criteria for the general pediatrician and specific criteria for researchers. The greatest change was the addition of a paragraph regarding the neurobiology of pain in infants and toddlers, including the understanding of the neurodevelopment of nociception and of the wide array of factors that may impact the pain experience.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074fe","authors":["Marc A.
