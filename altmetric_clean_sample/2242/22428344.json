The pathways that drive the immune response involving neutrophils are unclear. This study shows that Wolbachia endobacteria (detectable by polyclonal antibodies against endobacterial heat shock protein 60 and catalase and by polymerase chain reaction being sensitive to doxycycline treatment) are direct and indirect sources of signals accounting for neutrophil accumulation around adult Onchocerca volvulus filariae. Worm nodules from untreated onchocerciasis patients displayed a strong neutrophil infiltrate adjacent to the live adult worms. In contrast, in patients treated with doxycycline to eliminate the endobacteria from O. volvulus and to render the worms sterile, the neutrophil accumulation around live adult filariae was drastically reduced. Neutrophils were absent in worm nodules from the deer filaria Onchocerca flexuosa, a species which does not contain endobacteria. Extracts of O. volvulus extirpated from untreated patients showed neutrophil chemotactic activity and in addition, induced strong TNF-alpha and IL-8 production in human monocytes, in contrast to filarial extracts obtained after doxycycline treatment. Thus, neutrophil chemotaxis and activation are induced directly by endobacterial products and also indirectly via chemokine induction by monocytes. These results show that the neutrophil response is a characteristic of endobacteria-containing filariae.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5043cf058f6100030c1","authors":["Norbert W. Brattig","Dietrich W.
