Video Interaction Guidance (VIG) is an intervention using positive video feedback to empower staff through reflection on practice. This qualitative study explored the implementation of VIG within an autism care organization in England, from the perspective of staff members undergoing training to deliver VIG.\nSemi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 7 participants working within the organization (5 staff undergoing training to deliver VIG; 2 senior managers influencing co-ordination of training). Participants were asked about their views of VIG and its implementation. The topic guide was informed by Normalization Process Theory (NPT). Data were analysed inductively and emerging issues were related to NPT.\nFive broad themes were identified: (1) participants reported that they and other staff did not understand VIG until they became involved, initially believing it would highlight negative rather than positive practice; (2) enthusiastic feedback from staff who had been involved seemed to encourage other staff to become involved; (3) key implementation challenges included demands of daily work and securing managers' support; (4) ideas for future practice arising from empowerment through VIG seemed difficult to realise within an organizational culture reportedly unreceptive to creative ideas from staff; (5) individuals' emotional responses to implementation seemed beyond the reach of NPT, which focused more upon collective processes.\nImplementation of VIG may require recognition that it is not a 'quick fix'. Peer advocacy may be a fruitful implementation strategy. Senior managers may need to experience VIG to develop their understanding so that they can provide appropriate implementation support. NPT may lack specificity to explain how individual agency weaves with collective processes and social systems to embed innovation in routine practice. This exploratory study has provided broad insights into facilitators and barriers to the implementation of an intervention to empower staff within an autism care organization. Further research is needed into similar interventions, including a focus upon staff members' emotional responses and resources, and how such interventions may relate to the culture of the organization in which implementation occurs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bb","authors":["Alex Hall","Tracy Finch","Niina Kolehmainen","Deborah James"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12913-016-1820-9","first_seen_on":"2016-10-21T19:13:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1472-6963"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Health Services Research","last_mentioned_on":1477389329,"links":["http:\/\/bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12913-016-1820-9","http:\/\/www.readcube.com\/articles\/10.1186%2Fs12913-016-1820-9?author_access_token=P9pm2kik2Uj4lwz97-e0U2_BpE1tBhCbnbw3BuzI2RMGGV9LgLtuB0E1wjr96OaClwJyhQsqrD27ZBM2Bf6c9AQCVwyy0M5QQACRktY5Hnk0Izsnb0b_8f4LpsZ9QF-h80-8RrekrWN0r4uybkQ2jw=="],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12913-016-1820-9?site=bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"27769225","pubdate":"2016-10-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"608","subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"Implementing a video-based intervention to empower staff members in an autism care organization: a qualitative study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12913-016-1820-9","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/implementing-videobased-intervention-empower-staff-members-autism-care-organization-qualitative-stud"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.85,"score_history":{"1y":6.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8267094,"mean":6.9779357203246,"rank":1284415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6979726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8267094,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248200,"mean":12.799489167966,"rank":57694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":190399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248200,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3074,"mean":5.4959329645298,"rank":574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":2497,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3074,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":5.1478382352941,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
