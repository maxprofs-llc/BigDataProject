The hexameric ring of Mcm subunits forms six essential ATPases whose contributions to replication initiation remain unclear. Mcm2-7 complexes containing ATPase-motif mutations showed Mcm2-7 ATP binding and hydrolysis are required for helicase loading. Loading-defective Mcm2-7 mutant complexes were defective in initial Mcm2-7 recruitment or Cdt1 release. Comparison with Cdc6 ATPase mutants showed that Cdc6 ATP\u00a0hydrolysis is not required for helicase loading but instead drives removal of Mcm2-7 complexes that cannot complete loading. A subset of Mcm2-7 ATPase-site mutants completed helicase loading but could not initiate replication. Individual mutants were defective in distinct events during helicase activation, including maintenance of DNA association, recruitment of the GINS helicase activator, and DNA\u00a0unwinding. Consistent with its heterohexameric structure, our findings show that the six Mcm2-7 ATPase active sites are specialized for different functions during helicase loading and activation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ba","doi":"10.1016\/j.molcel.2014.06.033","first_seen_on":"2014-07-31T22:06:02+00:00","funders":["nigms","nci"],"issns":["1097-2765"],"journal":"Molecular Cell","last_mentioned_on":1406844133,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/molecular-cell\/abstract\/S1097-2765%2814%2900567-X#.U9q4fcfIVBE.facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S109727651400567X\/pdf","pmid":"25087876","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Multiple Functions for Mcm2\u20137 ATPase Motifs during Replication Initiation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiple-functions-mcm27-atpase-motifs-during-replication-initiation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4093361,"mean":5.0977156158875,"rank":3276590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":101059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4093361,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101961,"mean":8.0391446645744,"rank":81311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101961,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3226,"mean":4.4123807751938,"rank":2728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3226,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":9.965724137931,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
