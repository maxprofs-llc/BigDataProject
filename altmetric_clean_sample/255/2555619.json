In this research a synthetic gene fragment encoding the binding domain of botulinum neurotoxin type E (BoNT\/E-Hcc) was highly expressed in Escherichia coli by pGEX4T-1 vector. After purification, the recombinant BoNT\/E-Hcc was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and western blot (immunoblot) analysis. Average yields obtained in this research were 3.7 mg recombinant BoNT\/E-Hcc per liter of bacterial culture. The recombinant protein was injected in mice for study of its protection ability against botulinum neurotoxin type E challenges. The challenge studies showed that, vaccinated mice were fully protected against 10\u2074 \u00d7 minimum lethal dose of botulinum neurotoxin type E.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003740","authors":["Ebrahim Valipour","Mir-Latif Moosavi","Jafar Amani","Shahram Nazarian"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11274-014-1609-0","first_seen_on":"2014-07-31T01:16:14+00:00","issns":["0959-3993","1573-0972"],"journal":"World Journal of Microbiology & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1406758557,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s11274-014-1609-0"],"pmid":"24469548","pubdate":"2014-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Kluwer Academic Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Engineering\/Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology"],"title":"High level expression, purification and immunogenicity analysis of a protective recombinant protein against botulinum neurotoxin type E","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-level-expression-purification-immunogenicity-analysis-protective-recombinant-protein-against-bo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4095521,"mean":5.0915018305422,"rank":789742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3278178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4095521,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101919,"mean":8.0339780215468,"rank":23487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":78005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101919,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262,"mean":1.3362068965517,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.80882352941176,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
