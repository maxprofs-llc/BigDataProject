By controlling the formation of the perovskite layer and careful choices of other materials, we suppressed carrier recombination in the absorber, facilitated carrier injection into the carrier transport layers, and maintained good carrier extraction at the electrodes. When measured via reverse bias scan, cell PCE is typically boosted to 16.6% on average, with the highest efficiency of ~19.3% in a planar geometry without antireflective coating. The fabrication of our perovskite solar cells was conducted in air and from solution at low temperatures, which should simplify manufacturing of large-area perovskite devices that are inexpensive and perform at high levels.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Huanping Zhou","Qi Chen","Gang Li","Song Luo","Tze-bing Song","Hsin-Sheng Duan","Ziruo Hong","Jingbi You","Yongsheng Liu","Yang Yang"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.1254050","first_seen_on":"2014-07-31T20:08:55+00:00","issns":["1095-9203"],"journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1454064300,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/345\/6196\/542","http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/345\/6196\/542.abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/345\/6196\/542.full","http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/345\/6196\/542.full?sid=9060dbc2-4f32-448f-95cc-6d4283f5c0ab","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1126\/science.1254050","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.1254050","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25082698","http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/345\/6196\/542.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/345\/6196\/542.full.pdf","pmid":"25082698","pubdate":"2014-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Interface engineering of highly efficient perovskite solar cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interface-engineering-highly-efficient-perovskite-solar-cells-9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":44.57,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":44.57},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8283039,"mean":6.9844835160656,"rank":205524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8077515,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8283039,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180909,"mean":7.659371536914,"rank":5794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":175115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180909,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41517,"mean":33.096122844205,"rank":6134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":35381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41517,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":815,"mean":60.547373464373,"rank":238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":815,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":28,"Researcher":135,"Student  > Doctoral Student":28,"Student  > Ph.
