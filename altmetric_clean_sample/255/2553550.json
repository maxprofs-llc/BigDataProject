Consequently, this study examined these relationships in European American, African American, Latina, and Asian American college women (N=816). As expected, univariate analyses of variance indicated that European American women scored lowest on ethnic identity and highest on eating and weight concerns, whereas African American women scored lowest on thin-ideal internalization. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that ethnic identity was negatively associated with eating and weight concerns, while body mass index and thin-ideal internalization were positively associated. Ethnic identity moderated the relationship between thin-ideal internalization and eating concerns such that the relationship was stronger for participants with lower ethnic identity. These results suggest ethnic identity may be a direct or interactive protective factor against eating concerns in ethnically diverse college women.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fe3cf058f610006120","authors":["Rakhkovskaya LM","Warren CS"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bodyim.2014.07.003","first_seen_on":"2014-07-30T13:15:04+00:00","issns":["17401445"],"issue":"4","journal":"Body Image","last_mentioned_on":1406855698,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1740144514000795","http:\/\/authors.elsevier.com\/a\/1PRXv6BgRtdMUR"],"pmid":"25079012","pubdate":"2014-07-27T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Ethnic identity, thin-ideal internalization, and eating pathology in ethnically diverse college women ","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ethnic-identity-thinideal-internalization-eating-pathology-ethnically-diverse-college-women"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5028115,"mean":5.9640561526634,"rank":1919061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3068442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5028115,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125997,"mean":8.2733390266362,"rank":39902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":85047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125997,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299,"mean":7.3364966442953,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":17.184857142857,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
