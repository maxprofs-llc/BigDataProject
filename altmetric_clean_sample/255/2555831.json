A liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate was used as sample preparation. The separation was carried out on a C18 reversed-phase HPLC column followed by analysis via ESI-MS\/MS. The multiple reaction monitoring mode was used for quantitative measurement. For the first time, indole-3-acetic acid, indole-3-propionic acid, indole-3-butyric acid and JA were identified and quantified in the ethyl acetate extracts from the biomass, after the separation of mycelium from supernatant. The fermentation broths showed significantly higher levels of JA in relation to the other phytohormones. This is the first report of the presence of gibberellic acid, abscisic acid, salicylic acid and the cytokinins zeatin, and zeatin riboside in fermentation broths of Botryodiplodia sp. The presence of JA-serine and JA-threonine conjugates in fermentation broth was confirmed using HPLC-ESI tandem mass spectrometry in negative ionization mode, while the occurrence of JA-glycine and JA-isoleucine conjugates was evidenced with the same technique but with positive ionization. The results demonstrated that the used HPLC-ESI-MS\/MS method was effective for analysing phytohormones in fermentation samples.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003740","authors":["Grolamys Castillo","Alejandro Torrecillas","Clara Nogueiras","Georgina Michelena","Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez-Bravo","Manuel Acosta"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11274-014-1612-5","first_seen_on":"2014-07-31T06:27:16+00:00","issns":["0959-3993","1573-0972"],"journal":"World Journal of Microbiology & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1406771848,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s11274-014-1612-5"],"pmid":"24510403","pubdate":"2014-02-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Kluwer Academic Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Engineering\/Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology"],"title":"Simultaneous quantification of phytohormones in fermentation extracts of Botryodiplodia theobromae by liquid chromatography\u2013electrospray tandem mass spectrometry","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simultaneous-quantification-phytohormones-fermentation-extracts-botryodiplodia-theobromae-liquid-chr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4093361,"mean":5.0977156158875,"rank":790829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3274714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4093361,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101961,"mean":8.040469850922,"rank":23515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":78020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101961,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262,"mean":1.3467432950192,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.80882352941176,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
