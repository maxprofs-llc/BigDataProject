Exact link orbitals are rigorously defined from the full QM solution, and their number is equal to the number of orbitals in the primary QM region. Truncating the exact set yields a smaller set of link orbitals optimal with respect to reproducing the primary region density matrix. We use the optimal link orbitals to obtain insight into the limits of QM\/MM boundary treatments. We further analyze the popular general hybrid orbital (GHO) QM\/MM boundary across a test suite of molecules. We find that GHOs are often good proxies for the most important optimal link orbital, although there is little detailed correlation between the detailed GHO composition and optimal link orbital valence weights. The optimal theory shows that anions and cations cannot be described by a single link orbital. However, expanding to include the second most important optimal link orbital in the boundary recovers an accurate description. The second optimal link orbital takes the chemically intuitive form of a donor or acceptor orbital for charge redistribution, suggesting that optimal link orbitals can be used as interpretative tools for electron transfer. We further find that two optimal link orbitals are also sufficient for boundaries that cut across double bonds. Finally, we suggest how to construct \"approximately\" optimal link orbitals for practical QM\/MM calculations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bcd","authors":["Qiming Sun","Garnet Kin-Lic Chan"],"doi":"10.1021\/ct500512f","first_seen_on":"2014-07-30T18:38:12+00:00","issns":["1549-9618","1549-9626"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation","last_mentioned_on":1410229124,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ct500512f"],"pmid":"26588523","pubdate":"2014-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"startpage":"140725133847001","title":"Exact and optimal QM\/MM boundaries","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exact-optimal-quantum-mechanicsmolecular-mechanics-boundaries"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":715977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3787863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109242,"mean":8.0126280608932,"rank":20476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":88635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109242,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2251,"mean":1.2046933333333,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":2158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2251,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141,"mean":1.3557714285714,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
