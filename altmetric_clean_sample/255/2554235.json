The potent antigen presenting properties of DCs makes them a valuable target for the delivery of immunogenic cargo. Recent clinical studies describing in situ DC targeting with antibody-mediated targeting of DC receptor through DEC-205 provide new opportunities for the clinical application of DC-targeted vaccines. Further advances with nanoparticle vectors which can encapsulate antigens and adjuvants within the same compartment and be targeted against diverse DC subsets also represent an attractive strategy for targeting DCs. This review provides a brief summary of the rationale behind targeting dendritic cells in situ, the existing pre-clinical and clinical data on these vaccines and challenges faced by the next generation DC-targeted vaccines.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a9b","authors":["Kartik Sehgal","Kavita M Dhodapkar","Madhav V Dhodapkar","Sehgal K","Dhodapkar KM","Dhodapkar MV"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.imlet.2014.07.004","endpage":"67","first_seen_on":"2014-07-30T16:47:14+00:00","funders":["nci","niaid"],"issns":["1879-0542","0165-2478","01652478"],"issue":"1","journal":"Immunology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1437749406,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25072116?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25072116?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25072116","pubdate":"2014-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"59","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Targeting human dendritic cells in situ to improve vaccines.","type":"article","volume":"162","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeting-human-dendritic-cells-situ-improve-vaccines"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5395531,"mean":6.2970988699921,"rank":2677941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2555232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5395531,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131549,"mean":8.422013804847,"rank":60555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":65997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131549,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":473,"mean":1.7963093220339,"rank":197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":473,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.1685185185185,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
