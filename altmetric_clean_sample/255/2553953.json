In Purkinje cells, both complex and simple spike network patterns are evident in sensorimotor behavior. However, task-related patterns of activity in the granule cell layer (GCL) have been less studied. We recorded local field potential (LFP) activity simultaneously in pairs of GCL sites in monkeys performing an active expectancy (lever-press) task, in passive expectancy, and at rest. LFP sites were selected when they showed strong 10-25 Hz oscillations; pair orientation was in stereotaxic sagittal and coronal (mainly), and diagonal. As shown previously, LFP oscillations at each site were modulated during the lever-press task. Synchronization across LFP pairs showed an evident basic anisotropy at rest: sagittal pairs of LFPs were better synchronized (more than double the cross-correlation coefficients) than coronal pairs, and more than diagonal pairs. On the other hand, this basic anisotropy was modifiable: during the active expectancy condition, where sagittal and coronal orientations were tested, synchronization of LFP pairs would increase just preceding movement, most notably for the coronal pairs. This lateral extension of synchronization was not observed in passive expectancy. The basic pattern of synchronization at rest, favoring sagittal synchrony, thus seemed to adapt in a dynamic fashion, potentially extending laterally to include more cerebellar cortex elements. This dynamic anisotropy in LFP synchronization could underlie GCL network organization in the context of sensorimotor tasks.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc0a","authors":["Richard Courtemanche","Pascal Chabaud","Yves Lamarre"],"doi":"10.3389\/neuro.03.006.2009","first_seen_on":"2014-07-30T15:29:22+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1406734112,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2718782\/pdf\/fncel-03-006.pdf"],"pmid":"19649170","pubdate":"2014-07-30T20:09:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers Media SA","title":"Synchronization in Primate Cerebellar Granule Cell Layer Local Field Potentials: Basic Anisotropy and Dynamic Changes During Active Expectancy","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synchronization-primate-cerebellar-granule-cell-layer-local-field-potentials-basic-anisotropy-dynami"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4095521,"mean":5.0915018305422,"rank":2303096,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1047493,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4095521,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101547,"mean":8.0097215055247,"rank":54885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":26520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101547,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":666,"mean":2.6292661654135,"rank":368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":666,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.8620740740741,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
