Automated alerts that identify emergency patients promptly may improve trial performance. The main purposes of this project were to develop an automated real-time text messaging system to immediately inform physicians of patients with suspected stroke and to test its feasibility in the emergency setting.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008a6","doi":"10.1186\/1745-6215-15-304","first_seen_on":"2014-07-31T10:15:41+00:00","issns":["1745-6215"],"issue":"1","journal":"Trials","last_mentioned_on":1407148793,"links":["http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/15\/1\/304\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/pdf\/1745-6215-15-304.pdf","pmid":"25073719","pubdate":"2014-07-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"304","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Automated real-time text messaging as a means for rapidly identifying acute stroke patients for clinical trials","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/automated-realtime-text-messaging-means-rapidly-identifying-acute-stroke-patients-clinical-trials"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":1606299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2887152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109740,"mean":8.0777781463293,"rank":31784,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":77459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109740,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1428,"mean":4.1807960756833,"rank":516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1428,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":3.3231136363636,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
