Here we show that several selenoprotein mRNAs are not recognized efficiently by translation initiation factor eIF4E because they bear a hypermethylated cap. This cap modification is acquired via a 5'-end maturation pathway similar to that of the small nucle(ol)ar RNAs (sn- and snoRNAs). Our findings also establish that the trimethylguanosine synthase 1 (Tgs1) interacts with selenoprotein mRNAs for cap hypermethylation and that assembly chaperones and core proteins devoted to sn- and snoRNP maturation contribute to recruiting Tgs1 to selenoprotein mRNPs. We further demonstrate that the hypermethylated-capped selenoprotein mRNAs localize to the cytoplasm, are associated with polysomes and thus translated. Moreover, we found that the activity of Tgs1, but not of eIF4E, is required for the synthesis of the GPx1 selenoprotein in vivo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["Laurence Wurth","Anne-Sophie Gribling-Burrer","C\u00e9line Verheggen","Michael Leichter","Akiko Takeuchi","St\u00e9phanie Baudrey","Franck Martin","Alain Krol","Edouard Bertrand","Christine Allmang","Wurth, Laurence","Gribling-Burrer, Anne-Sophie","Verheggen, C\u00e9line","Leichter, Michael","Takeuchi, Akiko","Baudrey, St\u00e9phanie","Martin, Franck","Krol, Alain","Bertrand, Edouard","Allmang, Christine"],"doi":"10.1093\/nar\/gku580","first_seen_on":"2014-07-31T21:40:55+00:00","issns":["1362-4962","0305-1048"],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","last_mentioned_on":1413368467,"links":["http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/42\/13\/8663.short?rss=1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25013170?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/nar\/gku580"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/42\/13\/8663.full.pdf","pmid":"25013170","pubdate":"2014-07-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Hypermethylated-capped selenoprotein mRNAs in mammals.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypermethylatedcapped-selenoprotein-mrnas-mammals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4373405,"mean":4.8671827328057,"rank":3181138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":958476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4373405,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106954,"mean":7.5227704879714,"rank":75940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":24721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106954,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8701,"mean":3.029784137931,"rank":6276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":1892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8701,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":3.2225471698113,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
