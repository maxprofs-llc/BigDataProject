However, no convincing evidence has been found so far. Demonstrating that morphological evolution follows pendulum mechanics is important from a biomechanical point of view because during suspensory locomotion some morphological traits could be decoupled from gravity, thus allowing independent adaptive morphological evolution of these two traits when compared to animals that move standing on their legs; i.e., as inverted pendulums. If the evolution of body shape matches simple pendulum mechanics, animals that move suspending their bodies should evolve relatively longer legs which must confer high moving capabilities.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2008PLoSO...3.1841M","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Jordi Moya-Lara\u00f1o","Dejan Vinkovi\u0107","Eva De Mas","Guadalupe Corcobado","Eulalia Moreno"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0001841","first_seen_on":"2014-07-31T23:50:58+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1406817157,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0001841"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0001841.pdf","pmid":"18364999","pubdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Morphological Evolution of Spiders Predicted by Pendulum Mechanics","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/morphological-evolution-spiders-predicted-pendulum-mechanics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4093361,"mean":5.0977156158875,"rank":2300501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1047198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4093361,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101961,"mean":8.0405223224795,"rank":55115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":26634,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101961,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72372,"mean":8.3515208301668,"rank":41480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":20773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72372,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1957,"mean":15.995142126789,"rank":1258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1957,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
