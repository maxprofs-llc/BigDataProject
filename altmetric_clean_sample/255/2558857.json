However, no direct evidence has been shown for the possible common origin of these 2 diseases. Recent discovery of CARD15 mutations in BS families encouraged us to investigate similar CARD15 mutations in EOS patients. Among 10 EOS cases retrospectively collected in Japan, heterozygous missense mutations were found in 9 cases; 4 showed a 1000C>T (R334W in amino acid change) that has been reported in BS, 4 showed novel 1487A>T (H496L), 1538T>C (M513T), 1813A>C (T605P), and 2010C>A (N670K), and 1 case showed double 1146C>G (D382E)\/1834G>A (A612T) mutations on different alleles. All 6 of these variants of CARD15 showed increased basal nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity. These findings indicate that the majority of EOS and BS cases share the common genetic etiology of CARD15 mutations that cause constitutive NF-kappaB activation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Nobuo Kanazawa","Ikuo Okafuji","Naotomo Kambe","Ryuta Nishikomori","Mami Nakata-Hizume","Sonoko Nagai","Akihiko Fuji","Takenosuke Yuasa","Akira Manki","Yoshihiko Sakurai","Mitsuru Nakajima","Hiroko Kobayashi","Ikuma Fujiwara","Hiroyuki Tsutsumi","Atsushi Utani","Chikako Nishigori","Toshio Heike","Tatsutoshi Nakahata","Yoshiki Miyachi"],"doi":"10.1182\/blood-2004-07-2972","first_seen_on":"2014-07-31T19:26:25+00:00","issns":["1528-0020","0006-4971"],"issue":"3","journal":"Blood","last_mentioned_on":1325289600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1182\/blood-2004-07-2972"],"pmid":"15459013","pubdate":"2004-10-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Early-onset sarcoidosis and CARD15 mutations with constitutive nuclear factor-\u03baB activation: common genetic etiology with Blau syndrome","type":"article","volume":"105","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/earlyonset-sarcoidosis-card15-mutations-constitutive-nuclear-factor%CE%BAb-activation-common-genetic-etio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3788614,"mean":4.9961344153549,"rank":864565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2399898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3788614,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94769,"mean":7.7615855519326,"rank":25687,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":67953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94769,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7127,"mean":2.796144541117,"rank":1134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4501,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7127,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":3.4739152542373,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":99,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
