However, LSPR with narrow bandwidth (BW) is observed only in a select few noble metals, and ferromagnets are not among them. Here, we report the discovery of LSPR in ferromagnetic Co and CoFe alloy (8% Fe) in contact with Ag in the form of bimetallic nanoparticles prepared by pulsed laser dewetting. These plasmons in metal-ferromagnetic nanostructures, or ferroplasmons (FP) for short, are in the visible spectrum with comparable intensity and BW to those of the LSPRs from the Ag regions. This finding was enabled by electron energy-loss mapping across individual nanoparticles in a monochromated scanning transmission electron microscope. The appearance of the FP is likely due to plasmonic interaction between the contacting Ag and Co nanoparticles. Since there is no previous evidence for materials that simultaneously show ferromagnetism and such intense LSPRs, this discovery may lead to the design of improved plasmonic materials and applications. It also demonstrates that materials with interesting plasmonic properties can be synthesized using bimetallic nanostructures in contact with each other.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Ritesh Sachan","Abhinav Malasi","Jingxuan Ge","Sagar Yadavali","Hare Krishna","Anup Gangopadhyay","Hernando Garcia","Gerd Duscher","Ramki Kalyanaraman"],"doi":"10.1021\/nn5031719","first_seen_on":"2014-07-31T18:15:00+00:00","issns":["1936-0851","1936-086X"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1407349423,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/nn5031719"],"pmid":"25068441","pubdate":"2014-07-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"140730142242000","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Ferroplasmons: Intense Localized Surface Plasmons in Metal-Ferromagnetic Nanoparticles","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ferroplasmons-intense-localized-surface-plasmons-metalferromagnetic-nanoparticles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4113006,"mean":5.1054066695351,"rank":1971300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2065339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4113006,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102405,"mean":8.0470765204485,"rank":44714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":55408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102405,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3228,"mean":8.8866966222498,"rank":1770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3228,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213,"mean":8.0961698113208,"rank":99,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
