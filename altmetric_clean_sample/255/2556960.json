The anti ulcer activity of the root bark methanol extract of Cochlospermum planchonii was evaluated using different [ethanol, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), cold\/restraint stress and pyloric ligation\/histamine - induced ulcers and acid production] ulcerogenic models in rats at the doses of 250, 500, and 1000 mg\/kg body weight using cimetidine (100 mg\/kg) as a standard reference drug. The different doses of the extract and the reference drug significantly (p < 0.01) decreased all the ulcer parameters in a dose dependent manner in all the models used. The total number of ulcers were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased. The ulcer index was significantly (p < 0.004) reduced by the extract. Similarly, the percentage ulcer preventive index was also increased from 0% in the negative control up to 93.2% at the dose of 1000 mg\/kg, while the percentage ulcer severity was dose dependently reduced by the extract. Furthermore, the extract significantly (p < 0.02) decreased free gastric HCl and total gastric acid. In conclusion, Cochlospermum planchonii methanolic root bark extract showed significant antiulcer activity in this study which may be as a result of its cytoprotective, antioxidant or antisecretory properties.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa57a3cf058f610004da9","authors":["Ezeja MI","Anaga AO"],"first_seen_on":"2014-07-31T10:09:15+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"5","journal":"African Journal of Traditional, Complementary & Alternative Medicines","last_mentioned_on":1406801295,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24311856?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3847436","pmid":"24311856","pubdate":"2013-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Anti-Ulcerogenic Activity of the Methanol Root Bark Extract of Cochlospermum Planchonii (Hook f).","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiulcerogenic-activity-methanol-root-bark-extract-cochlospermum-planchonii-hook-f"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":3502085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109724,"mean":7.9891463959244,"rank":83054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":806,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109724,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157,"mean":1.4492051282051,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.75,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
