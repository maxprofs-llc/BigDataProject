The composition and characteristics of the tumor microenvironment vary widely and are important in determining the anti-tumor immune response. Successful immunization requires activation of both innate and adaptive immunity. Generally, immune system is compromised in patients with cancer due to immune suppression, loss of tumor antigen expression and dysfunction of antigen presenting cells (APC). Thus, therapeutic immunization leading to cancer regression remains a significant challenge. Certain cells of the immune system, including dendritic cells (DCs) and gamma delta (\u03b3\u03b4) T cells are capable of driving potent anti-tumor responses. The property of MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity, high potential of cytokine release, tissue tropism and early activation in infections and malignant disease makes \u03b3\u03b4 T cells as an emerging candidate for immunotherapy. Various strategies are being developed to enhance anti-tumor immune responses of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and DCs one of them is the use of novel adjuvants like toll like receptors (TLR) agonists, which enhance \u03b3\u03b4 T cell function directly or through DC activation, which has ability to prime \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. TLR agonists are being used clinically either alone or in combination with tumor antigens and has shown initial success in both enhancing immune responses and eliciting anti-tumor activity. TLR activated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and DCs nurture each other's activation. This provides a potent base for first line of defense and manipulation of the adaptive response against pathogens and cancer. The available data provides a strong rationale for initiating combinatorial therapy for the treatment of diseases and this review will summarize the application of adjuvants (TLRs) for boosting immune response of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells to treat cancer and infectious diseases and their use in combinatorial therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90c3cf058f61000cb02","authors":["Dar, Asif Amin","Patil, Rushikesh Sudam","Chiplunkar, Shubhada Vivek"],"doi":"10.3389\/fimmu.2014.00366","first_seen_on":"2014-07-31T15:28:57+00:00","issns":["1664-3224"],"journal":"Frontiers in immunology","last_mentioned_on":1408463685,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fimmu.2014.00366\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25132835?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fimmu.2014.00366\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4116803","pmid":"25132835","pubdate":"2014-07-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Insights into the Relationship between Toll Like Receptors and Gamma Delta T Cell Responses","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/insights-relationship-between-toll-like-receptors-gamma-delta-t-cell-responses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":1754783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2729564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109740,"mean":8.0881331705231,"rank":36718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":72170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109740,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1852,"mean":1.7330772555375,"rank":381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":1444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1852,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":2.2093643410853,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
