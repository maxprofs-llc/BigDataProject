Patients with chronic ocular inflammatory disease were included in the study.\nControl of inflammation, steroid-sparing effect, visual acuity, and adverse reactions were measured.\nA total of 54 patients were evaluated. Control of ocular inflammation with mycophenolate mofetil as monotherapy was achieved in 35 patients (65%) and in 67 eyes (62%), and a steroid-sparing effect was achieved in 29 (54%) patients. Visual acuity was maintained or improved in 51 patients (94%) and in 97 eyes (90%). Side effects requiring discontinuation of medication occurred in 10 patients (18%). There was neither long-term morbidity nor mortality due to mycophenolate mofetil.\nMycophenolate mofetil is effective in the treatment of patients with steroid-dependent or -resistant chronic ocular inflammatory disorders that fail to respond to conventional steroid treatment. It is a safe and effective steroid-sparing immunomodulatory agent and can be considered an important addition to our armamentarium in the care of patients with ocular inflammatory disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003250","authors":["Stefanos Baltatzis","Fehma Tufail","Ellen N Yu","Cindy M Vredeveld","C.Stephen Foster"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0161-6420(03)00092-7","endpage":"1065","first_seen_on":"2014-07-31T19:26:21+00:00","issns":["01616420","0161-6420"],"issue":"5","journal":"Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1325289600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0161-6420(03)00092-7"],"pmid":"12750115","pubdate":"2003-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1061","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Mycophenolate mofetil as an immunomodulatory agent in the treatment of chronic ocular inflammatory disorders","type":"article","volume":"110","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mycophenolate-mofetil-immunomodulatory-agent-treatment-chronic-ocular-inflammatory-disorders"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3788614,"mean":4.9961344153549,"rank":864565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2399898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3788614,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94769,"mean":7.7615855519326,"rank":25687,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":67953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94769,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1106,"mean":3.8426841628959,"rank":176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1106,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":3.0724137931034,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
