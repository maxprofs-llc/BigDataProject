Clinical trials have shown that the use of tumor antigen-loaded DCs in cancer patients is safe and that it has the potential to induce anti-tumor immunity which, in some cases, culminates in striking clinical responses. Unfortunately, in a considerable number of patients, DC vaccination is unable to mount effective anti-tumor immune responses and, if it does so, the resultant immunity is often insufficient to translate into tangible clinical benefit. This underscores the necessity to re-design and optimize the current procedures for DC vaccine manufacturing. A new generation of DC vaccines with improved potency has now become available for clinical use as a result of extensive pre-clinical research. One of the promising next-generation DC vaccine candidates are interleukin (IL)-15-differentiated DCs. In this commentary, we will compile the research data that have been obtained by our group and other groups with these so-called IL-15 DCs and summarize the evidence supporting the implementation of IL-15 DCs in DC-based cancer vaccination regimens.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9343cf058f61000dea9","authors":["Anguille S","Lion E","Van den Bergh J","Van Acker HH","Willemen Y","Smits EL","Van Tendeloo VF","Berneman ZN","S\u00e9bastien Anguille","Eva Lion","Johan Van den Bergh","Heleen H Van Acker","Yannick Willemen","Evelien L Smits","Viggo F Van Tendeloo","Zwi N Berneman"],"doi":"10.4161\/hv.25373","first_seen_on":"2014-07-30T10:12:29+00:00","issns":["2164-554X","2164-5515"],"issue":"9","journal":"Human vaccines immunotherapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1491370386,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23778748?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3906362\/pdf\/hvi-9-1956.pdf","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3906362\/pdf\/hvi-9-1956.pdf"],"pmcid":"PMC3906362","pmid":"23778748","pubdate":"2013-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Interleukin-15 dendritic cells as vaccine candi-dates for cancer immunotherapy.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interleukin15-dendritic-cells-vaccine-candidates-cancer-immunotherapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":4275187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3967815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180853,"mean":7.6789442969945,"rank":79908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":94437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180853,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1123,"mean":4.7560998217469,"rank":436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1123,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":3.6300659340659,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
