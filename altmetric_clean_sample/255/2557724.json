Data was derived from the 2009 Youth Risk Behavior Survey study of adolescent behaviors. The results of this study indicated that recreational physical activity, attending PE class, and participating in sports were independent protective factors for many cigarette use behaviors but not for smokeless tobacco use. Additionally, recreational physical activity and sports participation appears to be a protective factor for marijuana use among females but not males. On the other hand, recreational physical activity and sports participation appears to be a risk factor for alcohol use behaviors among males.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033db","authors":["Michael S Dunn"],"doi":"10.2466\/18.06.pr0.114k28w7","first_seen_on":"2014-07-31T13:19:29+00:00","issns":["0033-2941"],"issue":"3","journal":"Psychological Reports","last_mentioned_on":1406812702,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25074297"],"pmid":"25074297","pubdate":"2014-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Association between physical activity and substance use behaviors among high school students participating in the 2009 youth risk behavior survey.","type":"article","volume":"114","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-physical-activity-substance-behaviors-among-high-school-students-participating-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4093361,"mean":5.0977156158875,"rank":2300506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1047191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4093361,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101961,"mean":8.040469850922,"rank":55114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":26635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101961,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1001,"mean":3.342838,"rank":571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1001,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.8472,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
