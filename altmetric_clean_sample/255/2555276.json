A series of recent studies suggest that CaMKII dysfunction throughout the brain may underlie myriad neuropsychiatric disorders, including drug addiction, schizophrenia, depression, epilepsy, and multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, perhaps through maladaptations in glutamate signaling and neuroplasticity. I review here the structure, function, subcellular localization, and expression patterns of CaMKII isoforms, as well as recent advances demonstrating that disturbances in these properties may contribute to psychiatric disorders.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036b1","doi":"10.1016\/j.tins.2014.07.001","first_seen_on":"2014-07-30T23:51:53+00:00","issns":["0166-2236"],"journal":"Trends in Neurosciences","last_mentioned_on":1407198733,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Farticle%2FS0166-2236%252814%252900106-4%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes%253Frss%253Dyes&code=cell-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S0166223614001064\/pdf","pmid":"25087161","publisher":"Elsevier","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Emerging role of CaMKII in neuropsychiatric disease","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emerging-role-camkii-neuropsychiatric-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4108503,"mean":5.1033194562536,"rank":3289475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":101083,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4108503,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101943,"mean":8.0128358870731,"rank":81351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101943,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":857,"mean":5.0102009345794,"rank":747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":857,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":28,"Student  > Ph.
