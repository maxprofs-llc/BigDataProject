Surgery has historically involved an open cubital tunnel release with or without transposition of the nerve. A comparative study has demonstrated that endoscopic decompression is as effective as open decompression and has the advantages of being less invasive, utilizing a smaller incision, producing less local symptoms, causing less vascular insult to the nerve, and resulting in faster recovery for the patient. Ulnar nerve transposition is indicated with symptomatic ulnar nerve instability or if the ulnar nerve is located in a \"hostile bed\" (eg, osteophytes, scarring, ganglions, etc.). Transposition has previously been performed as an open procedure. The authors describe a technique of endoscopic ulnar nerve release and transposition. Extra portals are used to allow retractors to be inserted, the medial intermuscular septum to be excised, cautery to be used, and a tape to control the position of the nerve. In our experience this minimally invasive technique provides good early outcomes. This report details the indications, contraindications, surgical technique, and rehabilitation of the endoscopic ulnar nerve release and transposition.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008ae8","authors":["Levi P.
