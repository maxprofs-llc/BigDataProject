These stains often have a distinctive morphology that includes satellite stains, thought to be a highly sensitive feature that is a function of surface roughness. This study presents the findings of experimental studies conducted with proxy blood on two fabrics, similar in labeled composition, to assess the influence of fabric type on satellite stain generation. The morphology of proxy blood stains on the two fabric types were found to be statistically distinguishable from one another, with the volume of satellite stains generated being dependent upon the surface roughness of the fabric. These findings provide an initial step that illustrates the viability of providing an empirical evidence base for the interpretation of satellite stains in forensic blood pattern analysis (BPA).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5f53cf058f610005ead","authors":["Miles, H.F.","Morgan, R.M.","Millington, J.E."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.scijus.2014.04.002","first_seen_on":"2014-05-13T17:27:38+00:00","issns":["1355-0306"],"journal":"Science & Justice","last_mentioned_on":1414449891,"links":["http:\/\/www.scienceandjusticejournal.com\/article\/S1355-0306(14)00049-5\/abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1355030614000495"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.scienceandjusticejournal.com\/article\/S1355-0306(14)00049-5\/pdf","pmid":"25002043","pubdate":"2014-05-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["jurisprudence"],"title":"The influence of fabric surface characteristics on satellite bloodstain morphology","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-fabric-surface-characteristics-satellite-bloodstain-morphology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5363693,"mean":6.274797117734,"rank":2225189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3051938,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5363693,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129882,"mean":8.0403103302255,"rank":46374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":80954,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129882,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182,"mean":4.0522651933702,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
