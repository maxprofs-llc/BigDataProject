The presence of the newly described grapevine red blotch-associated virus (GRBaV) is highly correlated with the disease. To more effectively detect and monitor the presence of the virus, a sample processing strategy and multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay were developed. Forty-two of 113 vine samples collected in or received from seven of the United States were shown to harbor the virus, demonstrating the virus is widely distributed across North America. Phylogenetic analyses of a viral replication-associated protein (Rep) gene fragment from the 42 isolates of GRBaV demonstrated distinct clades of the virus (1 and 2), with clade 1 showing the greatest variability. The full-length genome of six virus isolates was sequenced, and phylogenetic analyses of 14 whole genomes recapitulated results seen for the Rep gene. A comparison of GRBaV genomes revealed evidence of recombination underlying some of the variation seen among GRBaV genomes within clade 1. Phylogenetic analyses of coat and replicase-associated protein sequences among single-stranded DNA viruses showed GRBaV to group within the family Geminiviridae. This grouping is distinct from members of the Nanoviridae and Circoviridae, with limited significant affinities to both recognized genera and novel plant-infecting, gemini-like viruses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003329","authors":["Bj\u00f6rn Krenz","Jeremy R Thompson","Heather McLane","Marc Fuchs","Keith L Perry"],"doi":"10.1094\/phyto-02-14-0053-r","first_seen_on":"2014-05-10T04:47:41+00:00","issns":["0031-949X"],"journal":"Phytopathology","last_mentioned_on":1473415387,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24805072?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24805072\/?i=7&from=fuchs%20m","http:\/\/apsjournals.apsnet.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1094\/PHYTO-02-14-0053-R"],"pmid":"24805072","pubdate":"2014-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Grapevine red blotch-associated virus is widespread in the United States.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/igrapevine-red-blotchassociated-virusi-widespread-united-states"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":1380152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6967882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179390,"mean":7.4915764511762,"rank":31657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":147607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179390,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":924,"mean":3.359022751896,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":924,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.99024,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CL":1,"US":4,"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/phy_papers\/status\/464990099935985666","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2340750],"posted_on":"2014-05-10T04:47:33+00:00","author":{"name":"phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/438115152294989824\/0M7ZG0xC_normal.jpeg","description":"Continuous feed for phylogenetics papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
