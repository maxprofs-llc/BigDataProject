This study examined the risk of male premature mortality associated with incarceration. Data came from the Izhevsk (Russia) Family Study, a large-scale population-based case-control design. Cases (n = 1,750) were male deaths aged 25 to 54 in Izhevsk between October 2003 and October 2005. Controls (n = 1,750) were selected at random from a city population register. The key independent variable was lifetime prevalence of incarceration. I used logistic regression to estimate mortality odds ratios, controlling for age, hazardous drinking, smoking status, marital status, and education. Seventeen percent of cases and 5 percent of controls had been incarcerated. Men who had been incarcerated were more than twice as likely as those who had not to experience premature mortality (odds ratio = 2.2, 95 percent confidence interval: 1.6-3.0). Relative to cases with no prior incarceration, cases who had been incarcerated were more likely to die from infectious diseases, respiratory diseases, non-alcohol-related accidental poisonings, and homicide. Taken together with other recent research, these results from a rigorous case-control design reveal not only that incarceration has durable effects on illness, but that its consequences extend to a greater risk of early death. I draw on the sociology of health literature on exposure, stress, and social integration to speculate about the reasons for this mortality penalty of incarceration.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd0","authors":["William Alex Pridemore","Pridemore WA"],"doi":"10.1177\/0022146514533119","endpage":"233","first_seen_on":"2014-05-13T17:07:45+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["2150-6000","0022-1465"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Health & Social Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1443382268,"links":["http:\/\/hsb.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2014\/05\/02\/0022146514533119.abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/0022146514533119","http:\/\/hsb.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2014\/05\/02\/0022146514533119.long","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24793163","http:\/\/hsb.sagepub.com\/content\/55\/2\/215.full?keytype=ref&siteid=sphsb&ijkey=.KiF3X28xvBGw","http:\/\/hsb.sagepub.com\/content\/55\/2\/215.full","http:\/\/hsb.sagepub.com\/content\/55\/2\/215.long","http:\/\/m.hsb.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2014\/05\/02\/0022146514533119.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hsb.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2014\/05\/02\/0022146514533119.full.pdf","pmid":"24793163","pubdate":"2014-05-01T23:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"215","subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"The Mortality Penalty of Incarceration: Evidence from a Population-based Case-control Study of Working-age Males.","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mortality-penalty-incarceration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":70,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":70},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6912763,"mean":6.2079349064794,"rank":93037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":6819555,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6912763,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172015,"mean":7.0154729731303,"rank":3171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":168840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172015,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":475,"mean":18.31505907173,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":448,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":475,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":43.155,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":13,"researcher":5,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":13,"Scientists":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":13,"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SAGEHealthInfo\/status\/481162991321100288","license":"datasift","rt":["JofHSB"],"citation_ids":[2348192],"posted_on":"2014-06-23T19:52:51+00:00","author":{"name":"SAGE Health Research","url":"http:\/\/www.sagepublications.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/718100077592510464\/zQZ3LXeN_normal.jpg","description":"Follow us for the latest research on SAGE Publishing public health and health services, as well as general news items of interest.","id_on_source":"SAGEHealthInfo","tweeter_id":"338930010","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3462},"tweet_id":"481162991321100288"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VolkanTopalli\/status\/466397843239227392","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2348192],"posted_on":"2014-05-14T02:01:25+00:00","author":{"name":"Volkan Topalli","url":"http:\/\/aysps.gsu.edu\/profile\/volkan-topalli\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3287948695\/02e8f0376d4f72ca8442a864486ad48f_normal.jpeg","description":"Criminologist | Georgia State University | Into Urban Crime, Cybercrime, Future Crime, Cities, Cashless Economy, Offender Psychology, Crime Policy","id_on_source":"VolkanTopalli","tweeter_id":"473682279","geo":{"lt":33.749,"ln":-84.38798,"country":"US"},"followers":1261},"tweet_id":"466397843239227392"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MPEriksen\/status\/466585671189405697","license":"datasift","rt":["VolkanTopalli"],"citation_ids":[2348192],"posted_on":"2014-05-14T14:27:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Michael Eriksen","url":"http:\/\/publichealth.gsu.edu\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/755137280159916033\/sMzVDpTw_normal.jpg","description":"Dean and Regents' Professor, Georgia State School of Public Health.
