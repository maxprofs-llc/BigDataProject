Previous investigations identified four sulphonium sulphates, that is, salacinol (1), kotalanol (3), ponkoranol (5) and salaprinol (7), as the compounds responsible for the anti-diabetic activity. Their desulphonates (2, 4, 6 and 8) were also isolated as active constituents. Two separate quantitative analytical protocols, that is, for 1 and 3 and for 2 and 4, have been developed recently.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008534","authors":["Junji Akaki","Toshio Morikawa","Sohachiro Miyake","Kiyofumi Ninomiya","Mayumi Okada","Genzoh Tanabe","Yutana Pongpiriyadacha","Masayuki Yoshikawa","Osamu Muraoka"],"doi":"10.1002\/pca.2525","first_seen_on":"2014-05-13T12:31:54+00:00","issns":["1099-1565"],"journal":"Phytochemical Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1399984280,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24816820?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24816820","pubdate":"2014-05-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","botany"],"title":"Evaluation of Salacia Species as Anti-diabetic Natural Resources Based on Quantitative Analysis of Eight Sulphonium Constituents: A New Class of \u03b1-Glucosidase Inhibitors.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-isalaciai-species-antidiabetic-natural-resources-based-quantitative-analysis-eight-sulpho"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3568589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107795,"mean":7.7074015622394,"rank":83974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":860,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107795,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131,"mean":1.8897230769231,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
