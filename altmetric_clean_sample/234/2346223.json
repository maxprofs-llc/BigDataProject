To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed. Methods and results: Studies were identified in English-language articles by search of PubMed and Embase database (inception to July 2013). A total of 32 prospective clinical trials involving 5005 patients were identified and included for analysis. Overall, the weighted mean maintenance dosage of warfarin in patients with the -1639AA genotype decreased 2.62\u2009mg\/d compared with that in the -1639GG genotype patients (95% CI -3.10 to -2.14; P\u2009<\u20090.00001) when 24 eligible studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. Furthermore, significantly lower warfarin dose requirement was found in patients with GA genotype versus GG genotype (WMD, -1.32; 95% CI -1.67 to -0.96; P\u2009<\u20090.00001). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, statistically significant lower maintenance dosage of warfarin in patients with the AA genotype versus GG genotype were found in both Caucasians (WMD, -2.47; 95% CI -2.92 to -2.03; P\u2009<\u20090.00001) and Asians (WMD, -2.84; 95% CI -4.57 to -1.11; P\u2009=\u20090.001). Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicated that the VKORC1-1639G\u2009>\u2009A genetic polymorphism is associated with the variation of interindividual warfarin dose requirement in different ethnic populations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002692","authors":[" Bo Jin","Bo Jin","Jin B","Hong Y","Zhu J","Li Y","Shi HM"],"doi":"10.1185\/03007995.2014.912982","first_seen_on":"2014-05-13T01:36:29+00:00","issns":["0300-7995","1473-4877"],"issue":"8","journal":"Current Medical Research & Opinion","last_mentioned_on":1399944962,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1185\/03007995.2014.912982","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1185\/03007995.2014.912982"],"pmid":"24708259","pubdate":"2014-04-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Economics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The impact of VKORC1 -1639G&gt;A genetic polymorphism upon warfarin dose requirement in different ethnic populations.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-vkorc11639ggta-genetic-polymorphism-upon-warfarin-dose-requirement-different-ethnic-populatio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3059391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107795,"mean":7.7074692840049,"rank":72700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":23821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107795,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1123,"mean":2.0321033868093,"rank":698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1123,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":1.71725,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CMRO_Journal\/status\/466029068186423296","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2346223,2346223],"posted_on":"2014-05-13T01:36:02+00:00","author":{"name":"CMRO Medical Journal","url":"http:\/\/www.cmrojournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/474492886721896449\/Ja86fSwn_normal.jpeg","description":"Current Medical Research & Opinion - \nMEDLINE-indexed journal for rapid publication of clinical evidence","id_on_source":"CMRO_Journal","tweeter_id":"27037879","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":3540},"tweet_id":"466029068186423296"}]}}
