Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have emerged as promising alternatives to VKAs, although there are some particular considerations and challenges to their introduction in developing countries. This review summarises the current state of antithrombotic management of AF in the developing world, explores the early evidence for the NOACs and describes some of the special considerations that must be taken into account when considering the role of the NOACs within developing countries' health care systems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000282a","authors":["Durga Bista","Leanne Chalmers","Luke Bereznicki","Gregory Peterson"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00228-014-1693-y","first_seen_on":"2014-05-14T08:26:34+00:00","issns":["1432-1041","0031-6970"],"journal":"European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1405324137,"links":["http:\/\/rd.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00228-014-1693-y","http:\/\/rd.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00228-014-1693-y"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00228-014-1693-y.pdf","pmid":"24817486","pubdate":"2014-05-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Potential use of NOACs in developing countries: pros and cons","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s00228-014-1693-y","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-noacs-developing-countries-pros-cons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3039198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108065,"mean":7.7170269284871,"rank":71383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":23353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108065,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":709,"mean":2.8664378531073,"rank":514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":709,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":5.53,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
