The use of molecular epidemiology to document RSV transmission in the outpatient setting has not been well described. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 2 nosocomial outbreaks of RSV at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Subjects included patients seen at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance with RSV detected in 2 outbreaks in 2007-2008 and 2012 and all employees with respiratory viruses detected in the 2007-2008 outbreak. A subset of samples was sequenced using semi-nested PCR targeting the RSV attachment glycoprotein coding region. Fifty-one cases of RSV were identified in 2007-2008. Clustering of identical viral strains was detected in 10 of 15 patients (67%) with RSV sequenced from 2007 to 2008. As part of a multimodal infection control strategy implemented as a response to the outbreak, symptomatic employees had nasal washes collected. Of 254 employee samples, 91 (34%) tested positive for a respiratory virus, including 14 with RSV. In another RSV outbreak in 2012, 24 cases of RSV were identified; 9 of 10 patients (90%) had the same viral strain, and 1 (10%) had another viral strain. We document spread of clonal strains within an outpatient cancer care setting. Infection control interventions should be implemented in outpatient, as well as inpatient, settings to reduce person-to-person transmission and limit progression of RSV outbreaks.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e3","authors":["Chu, Helen Y.","Englund, Janet A.","Podczervinski, Sara","Kuypers, Jane","Campbell, Angela P.","Boeckh, Michael","Pergam, Steven A.","Casper, Corey","Chu HY","Englund JA","Podczervinski S","Kuypers J","Campbell AP","Boeckh M","Pergam SA","Casper C"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbmt.2014.02.024","endpage":"851","first_seen_on":"2014-05-13T00:23:19+00:00","funders":["niaid","nci","nhlbi"],"issns":["1083-8791","10838791"],"issue":"6","journal":"Biology of Blood & Marrow Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1399946972,"links":["http:\/\/www.bbmt.org\/article\/S1083-8791(14)00147-5\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.bbmt.org\/article\/S1083-8791(14)00147-5\/pdf","pmid":"24607551","pubdate":"2014-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"844","subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Nosocomial Transmission of Respiratory Syncytial Virus in an Outpatient Cancer Center","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nosocomial-transmission-respiratory-syncytial-virus-outpatient-cancer-center"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2087801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2382123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107796,"mean":7.7074010297326,"rank":46036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":60575,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107796,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":805,"mean":2.2536293532338,"rank":325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":805,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":3.9660625,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ldandersonjr\/status\/466037497189761024","license":"datasift","rt":["ASBMT"],"citation_ids":[2345777],"posted_on":"2014-05-13T02:09:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Larry Anderson,MDPhD","url":"http:\/\/profiles.utsouthwestern.edu\/profile\/102991\/larry-anderson.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/854184925733498880\/gnMPcdu5_normal.jpg","description":"Multiple Myeloma, Waldenstroms, Amyloidosis, and Stem Cell Transplant Specialist at UT Southwestern Medical Center, LLS 2015 Man of the Year (tweets are my own)","id_on_source":"ldandersonjr","tweeter_id":"2418271298","geo":{"lt":32.78306,"ln":-96.80667,"country":"US"},"followers":909},"tweet_id":"466037497189761024"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ASBMT\/status\/466010712368615424","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2345777],"posted_on":"2014-05-13T00:23:06+00:00","author":{"name":"ASBMT","url":"http:\/\/www.asbmt.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3573119426\/6c0ab4c188f068e442be31b85989f724_normal.jpeg","description":"American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation is an association for professionals in the field of blood and marrow transplantation and cellular therapy","id_on_source":"ASBMT","tweeter_id":"1379457751","geo":{"lt":41.85003,"ln":-87.65005,"country":"US"},"followers":2243},"tweet_id":"466010712368615424"}]}}
