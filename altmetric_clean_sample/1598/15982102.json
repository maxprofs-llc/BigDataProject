To study the temperature and humidity field in the new structure tobacco curing barn, a 3D transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed using porous medium, species transport, \u03ba-\u03b5 turbulence and discrete phase models. The CFD results demonstrated that (1) the temperature and relative humidity predictions were validated by the experimental results, and comparison of simulation results with experimental data showed a fairly close agreement; (2) the temperature of the bottom and inlet area was higher than the top and outlet area, and water vapor concentrated on the top and outlet area in the barn; (3) tobacco loading density and thickness of tobacco leaves had an explicit effect on the temperature distributions in the barn.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Zhipeng Bai","Duoduo Guo","Shoucang Li","Yaohua Hu"],"doi":"10.3390\/s17020279","first_seen_on":"2017-01-31T11:42:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"2","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1485862950,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/2\/279?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/2\/279?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/2\/279\/pdf","pmid":"28146128","pubdate":"2017-01-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Analysis of Temperature and Humidity Field in a New Bulk Tobacco Curing Barn Based on CFD","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/2\/279","volume":"17"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8156965,"mean":6.8933631772734,"rank":4330503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2257971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8156965,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262600,"mean":12.836847017696,"rank":149727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":86917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262600,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3351,"mean":1.9365426865672,"rank":1058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3351,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":576,"mean":1.6905843478261,"rank":157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":576,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PhiLifeSciences\/statuses\/826395205993582593","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15982102],"posted_on":"2017-01-31T11:42:25+00:00","author":{"name":"Phi Life Sciences","url":"http:\/\/www.philifesciences.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/785955844135407617\/tIqFI_Li_normal.jpg","description":"Phi Life Sciences is a Molecular  Diagnostic and Laboratory Service company.","id_on_source":"PhiLifeSciences","tweeter_id":"785955501959819265","geo":{"lt":32.77657,"ln":-79.93092,"country":"US"},"followers":175},"tweet_id":"826395205993582593"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/826395213941714944","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15982102],"posted_on":"2017-01-31T11:42:27+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/891043583511470080\/FfBKDjay_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
