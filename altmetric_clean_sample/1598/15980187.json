Since DNA replication is relevant to a wide range of other chromosomal activities, these may all be directly or indirectly affected when dNTP concentrations deviate from a physiologically normal range. The importance of understanding these consequences is relevant to genetic disorders that disturb dNTP levels, and strategies that inhibit dNTP synthesis in cancer chemotherapy and for treatment of other disorders. We review here how abnormal dNTP levels affect DNA replication and discuss the consequences for genome stability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90f3cf058f61000cc1b","authors":["Chen\u2010Chun Pai","Stephen Kearsey"],"doi":"10.3390\/genes8020057","first_seen_on":"2017-01-31T10:32:20+00:00","funders":["niehs","mrc"],"issns":["2073-4425"],"issue":"2","journal":"Genes","last_mentioned_on":1498770113,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2073-4425\/8\/2\/57?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28146119","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2073-4425\/8\/2\/57?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2073-4425\/8\/2\/57"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2073-4425\/8\/2\/57\/pdf","pmid":"28146119","pubdate":"2017-01-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"A Critical Balance: dNTPs and the Maintenance of Genome Stability","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2073-4425\/8\/2\/57","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/critical-balance-dntps-maintenance-genome-stability"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":3.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":2014419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6387554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281788,"mean":12.554296649596,"rank":90927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":190027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281788,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":509,"mean":2.8692992125984,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":509,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":2.6833009708738,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
