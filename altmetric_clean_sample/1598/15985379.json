Furthermore, artificial hybridization procedures between different ploidy species are explained. Amphiploids can be produced by rescuing aborted embryos and treating the F1 hybrids with colchicine to overcome sterility between interspecific plants. Furthermore, I present the cytological methods for observing somatic and meiotic chromosomes in the treated hybrids.","aggregated_in":[16247539],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Morikawa, Toshinobu","Toshinobu Morikawa"],"book":{"title":"Oat","isbns":["9781493966806","9781493966820"],"uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/book\/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-6682-0"},"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-6682-0_4","editors":["Sebastian Gasparis"],"first_seen_on":"2017-01-31T13:05:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1064-3745","1940-6029"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1485867918,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28132142"],"ordinal_number":4,"pmid":"28132142","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"series":{"title":"Methods in Molecular Biology","issn":"1064-3745"},"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Protocol for Producing Synthetic Polyploid Oats","type":"chapter","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/protocol\/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-6682-0_4","volume":"1536","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protocol-producing-synthetic-polyploid-oats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8156965,"mean":6.8933631772734,"rank":7063194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8156965,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262600,"mean":12.836853681849,"rank":217502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262600,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5827,"mean":1.9435338139375,"rank":4058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5827,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":911,"mean":2.2689362637363,"rank":648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":911,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/meiosis_papers\/statuses\/826416062744768512","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15985379,16247539],"posted_on":"2017-01-31T13:05:18+00:00","author":{"name":"meiosispapers","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/pmcarlton\/pubmed-rss-twitter","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/694039532400832512\/SSjYg2IY_normal.png","description":"Recent meiosis papers from pubmed RSS and bioR\u03c7iv.
