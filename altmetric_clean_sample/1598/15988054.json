The variation in the biomass, abundance and diversity of mobile invertebrates in eelgrass beds has been examined in relation to various abiotic and biotic factors, such as water temperature, salinity, eelgrass biomass and epiphytic microalgae presence. However, the importance of sessile epibionts, such as macroalgae and calcific spirorbid polychaetes attached to eelgrass blades, has not been the focus of previous studies. In the present study, we examined the effects of three different sessile epibionts, namely, branched red algae, filamentous green algae, and calcific spirorbid polychaetes, on the biomass and diversity of mobile invertebrates in the eelgrass beds of Akkeshi in northeastern Japan. The relationships between seven abiotic and biotic variables including three types of epibionts, and biomass of 11 dominant mobile invertebrate species as well as three community-level variables (the total biomass of mobile invertebrates, species richness and the Shannon-Wiener species diversity index) were analyzed using a linear mixed model. Our results show that branched red algae are correlated with Pontogeneia rostrata, Lacuna spp., Nereis sp., Syllis sp. and the total biomass of mobile invertebrates, filamentous green algae with P. rostrata, Ansola angustata and the species diversity of mobile invertebrates, and spirorbid polychaetes with A. angustata, Lacuna spp., Siphonacmea oblongata, Syllis sp., the species richness and diversity of mobile invertebrates. The effect size of the epibionts was similar or even higher than that of abiotic and eelgrass factors on the total biomass of mobile invertebrates, species richness, species diversity and most of dominant invertebrate populations across the taxonomic groups. Consequently, epibiotic macroalgae and spirorbid polychaetes can be good predictors of the variation in the total biomass, species richness and species diversity of mobile invertebrates and the biomass of major dominant species, especially for species that have a relatively high dependency on eelgrass blades. These results suggest that the different functional groups of sessile epibionts have significant roles in determining the biomass and diversity of mobile invertebrates in eelgrass beds.","altmetric_jid":"521f51273cf0582f62000000","authors":["Kyosuke Momota","Masahiro Nakaoka"],"doi":"10.7717\/peerj.2952","first_seen_on":"2017-01-31T14:06:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2167-8359"],"journal":"PeerJ","last_mentioned_on":1485897591,"links":["https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/2952\/","https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/2952.pdf"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/2952.pdf","pmid":"28168116","pubdate":"2017-01-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"PeerJ Inc.","title":"Influence of different types of sessile epibionts on the community structure of mobile invertebrates in an eelgrass bed","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-different-types-sessile-epibionts-community-structure-mobile-invertebrates-eelgrass-bed"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8156965,"mean":6.8933631772734,"rank":3819190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4305335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8156965,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262600,"mean":12.836871008648,"rank":126059,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":134689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262600,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3543,"mean":21.26628458498,"rank":2583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3543,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":298,"mean":31.549380471381,"rank":189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":298,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
