Subsequently, we investigated the role of combinations of antigen-specific and anti-idiotype antibodies in a variety of animal models of clinical diseases.\nAntigen-specific antibodies were produced by conventional immunization of mice (eg, with tetanus toxoid or by skin allografting). Subsequent anti-idiotypic antibodies were derived by exhaustive absorption of antigen-specific antibody, with confirmation of anti-idiotypic specificity by binding to relevant target antigen-specific antibodies in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Antigen-specific plus anti-idiotypic antibodies were then used to modulate skin allograft survival, dextran sulfate sodium\u00a0(DSS)-induced colitis, ovalbumin (OVA)-induced IgE production, and breast cancer growth in mice.\nInfusions of anti-BL\/6 antibodies together with BL\/6 anti-anti-BL\/6 antibodies specifically suppressed (>85%) an immune response to BL\/6 lymphocytes in C3H mice. The two kinds of antibodies with complementary specificity are hypothesized to stimulate 2 populations of T lymphocytes. Coselection of these 2 populations leads to a new stable steady state of the system with diminished reactivity to BL\/6 tissue. A combination of anti-C3H and C3H\u00a0anti\u2011anti-C3H IgG antibodies down-regulated inflammation in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (>75%) and attenuated anti-IgE production and sensitization to produce IL4 cytokines (>70%) in an OVA-allergy model. Combination of C3H anti\u2011BL\/6 and BL\/6 anti-anti-BL\/6 antibodies decreased tumor growth and metastases (>705) in an EMT6 transplantable breast cancer model.\nUse of a combination of antigen-specific and anti-idiotypic antibodies has potential as a new class of vaccines.","altmetric_jid":"521dffa83cf0582819000000","authors":["Reginald Gorczynski"],"doi":"10.2196\/ijmr.7612","first_seen_on":"2017-07-05T17:01:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1929-073X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Interact J Med Res","last_mentioned_on":1499274191,"links":["https:\/\/www.i-jmr.org\/2017\/2\/e8\/"],"pmid":"28679488","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"JMIR Publications Inc., Toronto, Canada","title":"Toward a New Kind of Vaccine: A Logical Extension of the Symmetrical Immune Network Theory","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/toward-new-kind-vaccine-logical-extension-symmetrical-immune-network-theory-corresponding-author"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166903,"mean":6.9134132553505,"rank":6202418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1098787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166903,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176399,"mean":11.578378587059,"rank":123534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":33320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176399,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":4.1861320754717,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JMedInternetRes\/statuses\/882645660109033472","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21531288],"posted_on":"2017-07-05T17:01:38+00:00","author":{"name":"J Med Internet Res","url":"http:\/\/www.jmirpublications.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/573596706631106561\/qFzI03Du_normal.png","description":"JMIR=leading publisher of peer-reviewed, open access #ehealth, #mhealth, #digitalhealth research journals, eg J Med Internet Res.
