Action of cisplatin on endothelial cells is mediated by protein kinase C (PKC-\u03b1), which further activates nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and induces canonical transient receptor potential channel (TRPC1) and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) expression. Increased ICAM-1 contributes to hyperadhesion of monocytes and endothelial dysfunction. PKC-\u03b1 is also involved in phosphorylation of TRPC1, resulting in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and further activation of NF-\u03baB. Although the role of altered intracellular zinc status is not known in cisplatin-induced vascular dysfunction, because of the ability of zinc to modulate PKC-\u03b1, NF-\u03baB activity, we hypothesized that zinc can ameliorate the extent of endothelial dysfunction induced by cisplatin. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with cisplatin (8.0\u03bcg\/ml) showed lowered intracellular free zinc, concomitant with enhanced activation of PKC-\u03b1, NF-\u03ba\u0392 activation, TRPC1, SOCE and ICAM-1 levels. Zinc deficiency per se induced using membrane permeable chelator (TPEN) mimicked the cisplatin-induced PKC-\u03b1, NF-\u03baB activation and ICAM-1 expression, but also activated Activator Protein-1 (AP-1). Zinc supplementation (2.0-10.0\u03bcM) to the endothelial cells during cisplatin treatment or TPEN-induced zinc deficiency suppressed PKC-\u03b1, NF-\u03baB, TRPC1, SOCE activation and lowered the ICAM-1 expression. Zinc supplementation thereby effectively decreased the cisplatin-induced endothelial permeability and adherence of the activated endothelial cells to U937 monocytes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000284e","authors":["Bodiga, Vijaya Lakshmi","Inapurapu, Santhipriya","Vemuri, Praveen Kumar","Kudle, Madhukar Rao","Bodiga, Sreedhar"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejphar.2016.09.013","first_seen_on":"2016-09-11T10:13:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0712","00142999"],"journal":"European Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1473588785,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27614131?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27614131","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Intracellular zinc status influences cisplatin-induced endothelial permeability through modulation of PKC\u03b1, NF- \u03baB and ICAM-1 expression","type":"article","volume":"791","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intracellular-zinc-status-influences-cisplatininduced-endothelial-permeability-through-modulation-pk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":7226970,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252645,"mean":12.433031997593,"rank":210120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252645,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2542,"mean":2.884658008658,"rank":2028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2542,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.75825,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/trp_papers\/statuses\/774913646312816640","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11946546],"posted_on":"2016-09-11T10:13:05+00:00","author":{"name":"trppapers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"trp_papers","tweeter_id":"4731026308","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":47},"tweet_id":"774913646312816640"}]}}
