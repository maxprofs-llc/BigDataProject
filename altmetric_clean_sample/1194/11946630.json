The divergence times was estimated to be 1.5-2.5 Mya. It is consistent with the hypothesis that the split of four clades is the consequence of vicariance resulting from both the intensive uplift of QTP and Tien Shan as well as the resultant expansion of the Taklimakan Desert. Several lines of evidences indicate dynamic demographic histories for the populations, with late Pleistocene and Holocene population bottlenecks and expansions except the Indus River.\nOur results clearly depicted the phylogenetic relationship of D. maculatus from Indus River, Tarim River and Ili River. The analyses implicated the relationship among the distribution of D. maculatus, paleo-drainages and geographic events, and implied the existence of the South Tarim River in history.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b5","authors":["Li, Guogang","Tang, Yongtao","Zhang, Renyi","Zhao, Kai"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12862-016-0756-3","first_seen_on":"2016-09-11T10:17:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2148"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Evolutionary Biology","last_mentioned_on":1473597488,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27613240?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27613240","pubdate":"2016-09-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Systematics\/Taxonomy\/ Biogeography","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Entomology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics and Population Dynamics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Phylogeography of Diptychus maculatus (Cyprinidae) endemic to the northern margin of the QTP and Tien Shan region","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phylogeography-idiptychus-maculatusi-cyprinidae-endemic-northern-margin-qtp-tien-shan-region"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":6045357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2015909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252646,"mean":12.432865427774,"rank":164061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":74429,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252646,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2015,"mean":9.2809851042701,"rank":1695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2015,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":10.818435897436,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":5,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1},"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/phylogeo_papers\/statuses\/774914699649396736","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11946630],"posted_on":"2016-09-11T10:17:16+00:00","author":{"name":"phylogeopapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/438368741533822976\/LcQ62cH9_normal.png","description":"RSS feed from arXiv, bioRxiv, Pubmed, and PeerJ maintained by @michaelgharvey","id_on_source":"phylogeo_papers","tweeter_id":"2361303974","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":248},"tweet_id":"774914699649396736"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mitopapers\/statuses\/774917945868767232","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11946630],"posted_on":"2016-09-11T10:30:10+00:00","author":{"name":"IamMitochondria","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/720525920327573504\/12ixravl_normal.jpg","description":"I came into eukaryotes few million years ago and now I am making them realise that I am a thing!!
