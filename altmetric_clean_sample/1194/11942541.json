The study group and control group were well matched for age and gender. Age, gender, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) with reference to the international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), and 25(OH)D 3, parathormone (PTH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and phosphorus (P) values were recorded for each participant.\nSerum 25(OH) D values were found to be statistically significantly (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03) lower in children with primary epistaxis than in the healthy control group. Our study also revealed that 25(OH) D values were considerably (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) lower in the group with primary epistaxis and upper respiratory tract infections (RTI) than in the group with primary epistaxis without upper RTI. Univariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that 25(OH)D 3\u00a0<\u00a020\u00a0ng\/ml [odds ratio (OR) 1.117, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.019-1.225); P\u00a0=\u00a00.019] and serum albumin level [OR 3.499, 95% CI (1072-11,426); P\u00a0=\u00a00.038] ratio were significantly related to primary epistaxis. Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that 25(OH)D 3\u00a0<\u00a020\u00a0ng\/ml [OR 1.141, 95% CI (1047-1242); P\u00a0=\u00a00.003] and serum albumin level [OR 3.340, 95% CI (1068-10,446); P\u00a0=\u00a00.038] ratio were significantly related to primary epistaxis.\nMany studies have revealed that vitamin D is a preventive and therapeutic agent for inflammation and infection, thereby providing benefits for children with primary epistaxis. In line with this, our study suggested that a patient's vitamin D status could also be important for the prevention of childhood primary epistaxis, although further studies are required to validate our findings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b88","authors":["Habip Almis","Ibrahim Hakan Bucak","Muhammed Nebi Caliskan","Mehmet Turgut","Almis, Habip","Bucak, Ibrahim Hakan","Caliskan, Muhammed Nebi","Turgut, Mehmet"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijporl.2016.07.037","endpage":"101","first_seen_on":"2016-09-11T00:47:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-8464","01655876"],"journal":"International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology","last_mentioned_on":1474621011,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.ijporlonline.com\/article\/S0165-5876(16)30250-6\/fulltext?elsca1%3Detoc%26amp;elsca2%3Demail%26amp;elsca3%3D0165-5876_201610_89__%26amp;elsca4%3DOtolaryngology&rc=0&code=pedot-site","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0165587616302506&_version=1&md5=324ab63b5f01cc808bdd26efcf90ee08"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijporlonline.com\/article\/S0165587616302506\/pdf","pmid":"27619037","pubdate":"2016-08-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"97","subjects":["otolaryngology","pediatrics"],"title":"Evaluation of vitamin D levels in children with primary epistaxis","type":"article","volume":"89","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-vitamin-d-levels-children-primary-epistaxis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":4252454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3953081,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253236,"mean":12.466430280174,"rank":128246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":115131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253236,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1907,"mean":1.7548604407135,"rank":505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":1293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1907,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":0.94587628865979,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"VE":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/orl_hmc\/statuses\/774771253521580032","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11942541],"posted_on":"2016-09-11T00:47:16+00:00","author":{"name":"orl_hmc","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/708408079591809024\/Mpx5R306_normal.jpg","description":"Dpto de ORL Hospital Militar Dr Carlos Arvelo.
