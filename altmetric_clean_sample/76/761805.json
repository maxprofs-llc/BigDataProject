Various hypotheses have been put forward to explain the lack of \"optimality\", including missing physiological and structural constraints and\/or missing fundamental relationships. In this issue, Dewar et al. (2012) highlight important optimality constraints due to finite minimum leaf dry mass per unit area the plants can achieve, while Peltoniemi et al. (2012) proposes that limited acclimation of hydraulic conductance to within-canopy light conditions is a key missing factor in canopy optimality. This commentary advocates that future large-scale model exercises need to introduce more realism in model predictions both by including hydraulic controls as well as consider additional constraints shaping foliage structure, chemistry and physiological activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036a2","authors":["Niinemets, \u00dclo"],"doi":"10.1093\/treephys\/tps045","first_seen_on":"2012-05-25T13:23:33+00:00","issns":["1758-4469"],"journal":"Tree Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1337945269,"links":["http:\/\/treephys.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/32\/5\/505.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/treephys.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/32\/5\/505.full.pdf","pmid":"22619073","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Forestry Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Optimization of foliage photosynthetic capacity in tree canopies: towards identifying missing constraints","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optimization-foliage-photosynthetic-capacity-tree-canopies-towards-identifying-missing-constraints"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635015,"mean":4.9193540767705,"rank":2899093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635015,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72578,"mean":4.3860055389448,"rank":52435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72578,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":340,"mean":1.4122890855457,"rank":157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":340,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Ph.
