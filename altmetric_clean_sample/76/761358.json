Generalised fatigue has a major impact on walking ability, with moderately disabled PWMS experiencing difficulty in walking extended distances. Localised motor fatigue in the ankle dorsiflexors can lead to foot drop, further reducing functional ambulation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a simple dynamic dorsiflexion assist orthosis on walking-induced fatigue, gait, balance and functional mobility in PWMS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007cc","authors":["James McLoughlin","Christopher Barr","Daina Sturnieks","Stephen Lord","Maria Crotty","McLoughlin JV","Barr CJ","Sturnieks D","Lord SR","Crotty M"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2377-12-27","first_seen_on":"2012-05-25T08:49:15+00:00","issns":["","1471-2377"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1338002110,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2377\/12\/27\/abstract"],"pmid":"22625433","pubdate":"2012-05-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"27","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Effect of wearing a dorsiflexion assist orthosis on mobility, perceived fatigue and exertion during the six-minute walk test in people with multiple sclerosis: a randomised cross-over protocol","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-wearing-dorsiflexion-assist-orthosis-mobility-perceived-fatigue-exertion-during-sixminute-wal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4713038,"mean":5.686287777077,"rank":2176340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2417245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4713038,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76232,"mean":4.9714821266938,"rank":28377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":45331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76232,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":938,"mean":3.6422283884739,"rank":436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":938,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":4.4154838709677,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
