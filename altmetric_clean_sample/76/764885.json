Testosterone increases muscle mass, strength, and satellite cell number in humans; however, the effects of testosterone on the regenerative potential of skeletal muscle are unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of testosterone on the skeletal muscle regeneration of young (2-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) male mice. We show that testosterone increases the number of proliferating satellite cells in regenerating \"tibialis anterior\" muscle of young and aged castrated mice 2 and 4 days postinjury. Testosterone supplementation increases the number and the cross-sectional area of regenerating fibers in both classes of age 4 days postinjury. Testosterone increases satellite cell activation and proliferation and the regeneration of both young and aged mouse muscle. These data suggest prospective application of androgens to improve the regenerating potential of the aged human skeletal muscle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fab","authors":["Serra C","Tangherlini F","Rudy S","Lee D","Toraldo G","Sandor NL","Zhang A","Jasuja R","Bhasin S"],"doi":"10.1093\/gerona\/gls083","first_seen_on":"2012-05-28T09:53:03+00:00","issns":["1079-5006"],"issue":"","journal":"Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1353163116,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22499765"],"pmid":"22499765","pubdate":"2012-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Testosterone Improves the Regeneration of Old and Young Mouse Skeletal Muscle.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/testosterone-improves-regeneration-old-young-mouse-skeletal-muscle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8269641,"mean":6.9782388933431,"rank":3542323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4691266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8269641,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95010,"mean":5.6107647907041,"rank":33853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":60730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95010,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1678,"mean":9.6990852713178,"rank":951,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":709,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1678,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":8.3651111111111,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
