We report a simple, efficient method of generating adaptive cross-linked polymers via olefin metathesis. By introducing a very low level of the Grubbs' second-generation Ru metathesis catalyst, a chemically cross-linked polybutadiene network becomes malleable at room temperature while retaining its insolubility. The stress relaxation capability increases with increasing level of catalyst loading. In sharp contrast, catalyst-free control samples with identical network topology and cross-linking density do not show any adaptive properties. This chemistry should offer a possibility to combine the dimensional stability and solvent resistance of cross-linked polymers and the processability\/adaptibility of thermoplastics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Yi-Xuan Lu","Fran\u00e7ois Tournilhac","Ludwik Leibler","Zhibin Guan"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja303356z","endpage":"8427","first_seen_on":"2012-05-25T15:36:00+00:00","issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"issue":"20","journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1403530027,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja303356z?ref=tw","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/ja303356z"],"pmid":"22568481","pubdate":"2012-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"8424","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Making Insoluble Polymer Networks Malleable via Olefin Metathesis.","type":"article","volume":"134","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/making-insoluble-polymer-networks-malleable-via-olefin-metathesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":19.646,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":19.646},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":239298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":4797350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77923,"mean":5.0001108031108,"rank":3418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":74505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77923,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15516,"mean":4.5749131807928,"rank":449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":15066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15516,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":482,"mean":3.9019417879418,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":482,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
