The results show that in rhesus macaques only the sequential intranasal and intramuscular administration of HIV-VLPs, and not the intranasal alone, is able to elicit humoral immune response at the systemic as well as the vaginal level.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ef8","authors":["L.
