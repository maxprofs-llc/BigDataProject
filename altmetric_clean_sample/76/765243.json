Hence, the collection of studies in this special issue on civic engagement in adolescence is not only timely and enlightening, but it also has the potentials to contribute to research in different disciplines on various dimensions, mechanisms and normative models of civic engagement. The studies reveal some promising attempts to bring civil themes into the field of adolescent development. However, to overcome some conceptual, methodological and empirical shortcomings, future developmental studies in the area need to be substantially improved by considering cultural and institutional conditions, by focussing on processes across various everyday life contexts, by merging theories from different disciplinary fields, by conceptualizing adolescents as changeable subjects, and by delineating untested and unwarranted normative assumptions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4de3cf058f610001ca5","authors":["Erik Amn\u00e5"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.adolescence.2012.04.011","endpage":"627","first_seen_on":"2012-05-28T15:17:22+00:00","issns":["01401971"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Adolescence","last_mentioned_on":1338217991,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0140197112000607"],"pmid":"22613043","pubdate":"2012-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"611","title":"How is civic engagement developed over time?
