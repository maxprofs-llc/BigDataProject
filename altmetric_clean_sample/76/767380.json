Therefore, understanding how therapeutic genotoxins such as ionizing radiation (IR) can elicit DNA damage responses in a p53-independent manner is of clinical importance. Drosophila has been a good model to study the effects of IR because DNA damage responses as well as underlying genes are conserved in this model, and because streamlined gene families make loss-of-function analyses feasible. Indeed, Drosophila is the only genetically tractable model for IR-induced, p53-independent apoptosis and for tissue regeneration and homeostasis after radiation damage. While these phenomenon occur only in the larvae, all genome-wide gene expression analyses after irradiation to date have been in embryos. We report here the first analysis of IR-induced, genome-wide gene expression changes in wild type and p53 mutant Drosophila larvae. Key data from microarrays were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. The results solidify the central role of p53 in IR-induced transcriptome changes, but also show that nearly all changes are made of both p53-dependent and p53-independent components. p53 is found to be necessary not just for the induction of but also for the repression of transcript levels for many genes in response to IR. Furthermore, Functional analysis of one of the top-changing genes, EF1a-100E, implicates it in repression of IR-induced p53-independent apoptosis. These and other results support the emerging notion that there is not a single dominant mechanism but that both positive and negative inputs collaborate to induce p53-independent apoptosis in response to IR in Drosophila larvae.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E6539V","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Petra van Bergeijk","Joseph Heimiller","Lyle Uyetake","Tin Tin Su","van Bergeijk P","Heimiller J","Uyetake L","Su TT"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0036539","first_seen_on":"2012-05-29T21:10:02+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1356437404,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0036539"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0036539.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3362589","pmid":"22666323","pubdate":"2012-05-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e36539","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Genome-Wide Expression Analysis Identifies a Modulator of Ionizing Radiation-Induced p53-Independent Apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomewide-expression-analysis-identifies-modulator-ionizing-radiationinduced-p53independent-apoptos"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2123043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2225893,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75677,"mean":4.8228927004598,"rank":30520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":42068,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75677,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80037,"mean":8.3222478884503,"rank":37804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":37706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80037,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3034,"mean":6.3359307616222,"rank":1440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3034,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
