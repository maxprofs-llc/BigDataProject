As a consequence, POLG mutations can cause disease through impaired replication of mitochondrial DNA. To date, over 150 different mutations have been identified, with a growing number of associated phenotypes described. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of POLG mutations in an adult population of Australian patients with mitochondrial disease, displaying symptoms commonly associated with POLG-related diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002afe","authors":["Woodbridge, P.","Liang, C.","Davis, R.
