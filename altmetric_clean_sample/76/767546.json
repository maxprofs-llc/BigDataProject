To quantify the contributions of different quenching mechanisms to NPQ, we have devised a technique to measure the changes in chlorophyll fluorescence lifetime as photosynthetic organisms adapt to varying light conditions. We applied this technique to measure the fluorescence lifetimes responsible for the predominant, rapidly reversible component of NPQ, qE, in living cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Application of high light to dark-adapted cells of C. reinhardtii led to an increase in the amplitudes of 65\u00a0ps and 305\u00a0ps chlorophyll fluorescence lifetime components that was reversed after the high light was turned off. Removal of the pH gradient across the thylakoid membrane linked the changes in the amplitudes of the two components to qE quenching. The rise times of the amplitudes of the two components were significantly different, suggesting that the changes are due to two different qE mechanisms. We tentatively suggest that the changes in the 65\u00a0ps component are due to charge-transfer quenching in the minor light-harvesting complexes and that the changes in the 305\u00a0ps component are due to aggregated light-harvesting complex II trimers that have detached from PSII. We anticipate that this technique will be useful for resolving the various mechanisms of NPQ and for quantifying the timescales associated with these mechanisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PNAS..109.8405A","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Kapil Amarnath","Julia Zaks","Samuel D.
