Yet, despite the recent focus on the transfers of care between resident physicians in inpatient settings, there has been minimal attention given to patient care transfers in academic ambulatory clinics. We sought to elicit the views of pediatric residents regarding year-end patient handoffs in a pediatric resident continuity clinic.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041d9","doi":"10.3402\/meo.v17i0.17815","first_seen_on":"2012-05-28T09:28:41+00:00","issns":["1087-2981"],"journal":"Medical Education Online","last_mentioned_on":1348489242,"links":["http:\/\/www.med-ed-online.net\/index.php\/meo\/article\/view\/17815"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/med-ed-online.net\/index.php\/meo\/article\/view\/17815\/pdf_1","pmid":"22670087","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["education"],"title":"Improving year-end transfers of care in academic ambulatory clinics: a survey of pediatric resident physician perceptions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improving-yearend-transfers-care-academic-ambulatory-clinics-survey-pediatric-resident-physician-per"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":1990143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2420581,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75718,"mean":4.7968865380297,"rank":27251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":46182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75718,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245,"mean":3.3456721311475,"rank":135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.675,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
