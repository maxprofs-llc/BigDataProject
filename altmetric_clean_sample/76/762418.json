In contrast to a prior study in which amnesic patients showed impaired performance (Verfaellie et al., Cognitive, Affective, and Behavioral Neuroscience, 2006, 6, 91-101), the current study employed a task that required active processing of the context word at test. In this version of the task, amnesic patients, like control participants, showed enhanced category exemplar priming when the context word associated with the target at study was reinstated at test. The finding of intact implicit memory for novel associations following hippocampal lesions in a task that requires flexible use of retrieval cues is inconsistent with a relational memory view that suggests that the hippocampus is critical for all forms of relational memory, regardless of awareness. Instead, it suggests that unaware memory for within-domain associations does not require MTL mediation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a5","authors":["Verfaelllie M","Larocque KF","Keane MM"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuropsychologia.2012.05.011","first_seen_on":"2012-05-25T20:12:00+00:00","funders":["phs"],"issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Neuropsychologia","last_mentioned_on":1337976711,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22609574"],"pmid":"22609574","pubdate":"2012-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychology","neurology"],"title":"Intact implicit verbal relational memory in medial temporal lobe amnesia.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intact-implicit-verbal-relational-memory-medial-temporal-lobe-amnesia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":3111340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1007921,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75478,"mean":4.6912452535209,"rank":48356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":18934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75478,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1735,"mean":4.4993448673587,"rank":1327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1735,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":3.2494418604651,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
