Retrospective review. Data were collected on all FB and a random sample of 5\u00a0% of USB pts in an HIV clinic in Colorado, USA. Comparisons were made between FB pts and USB pts and among FB pts by global region of origin and sex. Among 150 FB and 59 USB pts, FB pts were younger (40 vs. 45 years), proportionately more female (39 vs. 17\u00a0%), with heterosexual sex as HIV risk factor (69 vs. 23\u00a0%) and reported substance use less (6 vs. 38\u00a0%) (All p \u2264 0.001) compared to USB pts. Age and substance differences persisted between FB and USB women. Significant differences also existed between FB and USB pts in reason for HIV test, tuberculosis and mental health diagnoses, and diagnosis of >1 co-morbidity, but not in mean CD4 cell count (502 vs. 569), antiretroviral therapy (ART) (92 vs. 90\u00a0%), or alcohol use (29 vs. 37\u00a0%). Compared to FB women, FB men were more commonly men that have sex with men, from Latin America\/Caribbean, have HIV testing for illness, and have had a concomitant HIV and AIDS diagnosis while FB women were more commonly refugees, heterosexual and from Africa. Differences exist between FB and USB HIV-infected pts, and among FB pts themselves. HIV care and prevention programs must recognize and address these dissimilarities in order to maximize clinical outcomes, improve linkage to and continuity in care and optimize resource allocation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dee","authors":["Monica L.
