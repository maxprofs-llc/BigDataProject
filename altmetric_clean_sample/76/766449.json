However, we now face the issue of drug resistance due to deregulation in the quality control of both DNA and protein. BCR-ABL is basically a misfolded protein with intrinsically disordered regions, which not only produces endoplasmic reticulum stress followed by unfolded protein response in some settings, but also conformational plasticity that may affect the structure of the whole molecule. The intercellular signaling derived from the leukemic cell microenvironment may influence the intracellular responses that take place in a manner both dependent on and independent of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd7","authors":["Maru, Yoshiro"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1349-7006.2012.02346.x","endpage":"1610","first_seen_on":"2012-05-29T12:15:18+00:00","issns":["1349-7006","1347-9032"],"issue":"9","journal":"Cancer Science","last_mentioned_on":1348280959,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1349-7006.2012.02346.x\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1349-7006.2012.02346.x\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1349-7006.2012.02346.x\/pdf","pmid":"22632137","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1601","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"The molecular biology of chronic myeloid leukemia","type":"article","volume":"103","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-biology-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-18"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630815,"mean":4.9285062716012,"rank":2899087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630815,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72745,"mean":4.4630511932255,"rank":52800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72745,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":508,"mean":2.1919289940828,"rank":373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":508,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.9375,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
