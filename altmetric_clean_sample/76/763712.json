We herein report NMR- and modelling-based data on glycomimetics containing \u03b1-glycosidic linkages. The bioactivity of \u03b1-Gal-containing glycopeptides has been documented by revealing binding to two plant lectins, i.e. a potent \u03b2-trefoil toxin (Viscum album agglutinin) and \u03b2-sandwich lectin (Erythrina corallodendron agglutinin), by NMR protocols. Docking provided insights into the 3D structures of the resulting complexes. These results provide the basis to introduce \u03b1-substituted neoglycopeptides to the toolbox of scaffold for the design of potent lectin inhibitors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083f3","authors":["Filipa Marcelo","Francisco Javier Ca\u00f1ada","Sabine Andr\u00e9","Cinzia Colombo","Fabio Doro","Hans-Joachim Gabius","Anna Bernardi","Jes\u00fas Jim\u00e9nez-Barbero"],"doi":"10.1039\/c2ob07135e","first_seen_on":"2012-05-26T22:27:10+00:00","issns":["1477-0520","1477-0539"],"journal":"Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1330798716,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.rsc.org\/~r\/rss\/OB\/~3\/fhp5LYjQ5og\/C2OB07135E"],"pmid":"22441147","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"\u03b1-N-Linked glycopeptides: conformational analysis and bioactivity as lectin ligands","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/%CE%B1nlinked-glycopeptides-conformational-analysis-bioactivity-lectin-ligands"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627879,"mean":4.9457436126612,"rank":2017967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":933725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627879,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72509,"mean":4.4296786837314,"rank":32728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":26844,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72509,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":996,"mean":3.1218592964824,"rank":521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":996,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
