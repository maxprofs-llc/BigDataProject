The 4,5-diaza-fluorene fragment is approximately planar, with r.m.s. deviations of 0.0448 and 0.0198\u2005\u00c5 in the two mol-ecules. The dihedral angles between the 4,5-diaza-fluorene planes and the phenyl ring are 80.49\u2005(6) and 76.57\u2005(7)\u00b0. The crystal packing features O-H\u22efN and O-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds involving the bridging solvent water mol-ecules, which link the mol-ecules into a three-dimensional network.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ea","authors":["Wang, S.-M."],"doi":"10.1107\/s1600536812021940","first_seen_on":"2012-05-24T15:47:01+00:00","issns":["1600-5368"],"journal":"Acta Crystallographica: Section E (International Union of Crystallography - IUCr)","last_mentioned_on":1337874267,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S1600536812021940"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/e\/issues\/2012\/06\/00\/ez2292\/ez2292.pdf","pmid":"22719589","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"title":"9-Phenyl-4,5-diaza-9H-fluoren-9-ol monohydrate","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fluoren9ol-monohydrate"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":3557841,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":831076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77688,"mean":5.0095340275722,"rank":50016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":13665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77688,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1630,"mean":0.44660773480663,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":1047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1630,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.358,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/ActaCrystE\/status\/205685701633777664","citation_ids":[760009],"posted_on":"2012-05-24T15:44:27+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"ActaCrystE","tweeter_id":"587565184","geo":{"lt":53.1905,"ln":-2.89189,"country":"GB"}},"tweet_id":"205685701633777664"}]}}
