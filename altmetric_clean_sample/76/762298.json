However, it remains unclear whether irregular ventricular response patterns induced by AF increase sympathetic nerve activity. We measured resting multi- and single-unit muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in 21 age-matched HF patients with chronic AF (n = 11) rhythm or sinus rhythm (SR, n = 10). The multi-unit MSNA, which was expressed as total activity, was similar between HF + AF patients and HF + SR patients. However, the single-unit MSNA in HF + AF patients was significantly greater than that in HF + SR patients (62 \u00b1 9 spikes min(-1) vs. 42 \u00b1 4 spikes min(-1), P < 0.05). Moreover, the incidence of multiple firing of single-unit MSNA within a given burst was augmented in HF + AF patients as compared with HF + SR patients (48 \u00b1 8% vs. 26 \u00b1 3%, P < 0.01). A significant negative relationship was observed between the reduced diastolic pressure induced by a prolonged cardiac interval in AF subjects and single-unit MSNA frequency within one cardiac interval in each HF + AF subject. The firing characteristics of single-unit MSNA were different between HF patients with AF and HF patients with SR; particularly, those with a prolonged long RR interval showed multiple firings of single-unit MSNA. These findings suggest that AF per se leads to the instantaneous augmentation of single-unit MSNA induced by decreased diastolic pressure, which might partially contribute to disease progression in HF patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007df5","authors":["Ikeda T","Murai H","Kaneko S","Usui S","Kobayashi D","Nakano M","Ikeda K","Takashima SI","Kato T","Okajima M","Furusho H","Takamura M"],"doi":"10.1113\/jphysiol.2011.223842","first_seen_on":"2012-05-25T19:06:58+00:00","issns":["0022-3751"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1337731200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22144576","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1113\/jphysiol.2011.223842"],"pmid":"22144576","pubdate":"2011-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Augmented single-unit muscle sympathetic nerve activity in heart failure with chronic atrial fibrillation.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/augmented-singleunit-muscle-sympathetic-nerve-activity-heart-failure-chronic-atrial-fibrillation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628077,"mean":4.9442940120368,"rank":2017750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":934533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628077,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72546,"mean":4.4213729960713,"rank":32743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":26900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72546,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2247,"mean":5.0895458593054,"rank":1200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2247,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":6.5456428571429,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"LT":1}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/715647823","license":"public","citation_ids":[762298],"posted_on":"2012-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["confirmation","new_finding"],"f1000_score":"1"}]}}
