However, it is unclear if loss of DCC is the specific underlying cause of these cancers. The Drosophila imaginal discs are excellent systems in which to study DCC function, as it is possible to model human tumors through the generation of somatic clones of cells bearing multiple genetic lesions. Here, these attributes of the fly system were utilized to investigate the potential tumor suppressing functions of the Drosophila DCC homologue frazzled (fra) during eye-antennal disc development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b2","authors":["Adrienne VanZomeren-Dohm","Adrienne VanZomeren-Dohm","Joseph Sarro","Ellen Flannery","Molly Duman-Scheel"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-213x-11-41","first_seen_on":"2012-05-29T12:00:45+00:00","issns":["1471-213X"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Developmental Biology","last_mentioned_on":1338292803,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-213X\/11\/41"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/bmcdevbiol\/content\/pdf\/1471-213X-11-41.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3144007","pmid":"21672235","pubdate":"2011-06-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"41","subjects":["embryology"],"title":"The Drosophila Netrin receptor frazzled\/DCC functions as an invasive tumor suppressor","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/drosophila-netrin-receptor-frazzleddcc-functions-invasive-tumor-suppressor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":3111450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1008091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75676,"mean":4.7629332011892,"rank":48618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":18962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75676,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162,"mean":2.3125341614907,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":3.4766666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
