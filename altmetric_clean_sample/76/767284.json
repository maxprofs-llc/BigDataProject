The diene ligand was proved to be essential for the formation of the addition products, while the use of a bisphosphine ligand mainly gave the cine-substitution product.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Takahiro Nishimura","Yuka Takiguchi","Tamio Hayashi"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja303109q","first_seen_on":"2012-05-29T19:54:19+00:00","issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1338321242,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja303109q"],"pmid":"22616790","pubdate":"2012-05-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"120529104126008","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Effect of Chiral Diene Ligands in Rhodium-Catalyzed Asymmetric Addition of Arylboronic Acids to \u03b1,\u03b2-Unsaturated Sulfonyl Compounds","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-chiral-diene-ligands-rhodiumcatalyzed-asymmetric-addition-arylboronic-acids-%CE%B1%CE%B2unsaturated-sul"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":3497939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75675,"mean":4.7630238919576,"rank":56706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75675,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15477,"mean":4.1146077797881,"rank":12710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":1168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15477,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":483,"mean":4.1004854771784,"rank":432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":483,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
