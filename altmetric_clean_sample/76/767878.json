There are two crystallographically independent molecules in the asymmetric unit, related by a noncrystallographic inversion centre.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002149","authors":["Strassner, T."],"doi":"10.1107\/s0108270112020884","first_seen_on":"2012-05-30T03:24:11+00:00","issns":["0108-2701"],"journal":"Acta Crystallographica: Section C (International Union of Crystallography - IUCr)","last_mentioned_on":1338553255,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper_yard?eg3092&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/c\/issues\/2012\/06\/00\/eg3092\/eg3092.pdf","pmid":"22669189","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
