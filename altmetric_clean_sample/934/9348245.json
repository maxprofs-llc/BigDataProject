Accordingly, a new ground-state crystal structure WB2 (P63\/mmc, 2 fu\/cell) is uncovered. The experimental synthesized rhombohedral R3\u0305m and hexagonal AlB2, as well as theoretical predicted RuB2 structures, are no longer the most favorite structures. By analyzing the elastic constants, formation enthalpies, and phonon dispersion, we find that the WB2 phase is thermodynamically and mechanically stable. The high bulk modulus B, shear modulus G, low Poisson's ratio \u03bd, and small B\/G ratio are benefit to its low compressibility. When the pressure is 10 GPa, a phase transition is observed between the WB2-MoB2 and the rhombohedral R3\u0305m MoB2 phases. By analyzing the density of states and electron density, we find that the strong covalent is formed in MoB2 compounds, which contributes a great deal to its low compressibility. Furthermore, the low compressibility is also correlated with the local buckled structure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Li-Ping Ding"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b00899","first_seen_on":"2016-07-08T10:42:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"issue":"14","journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1468425522,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b00899"],"pmid":"27387577","pubdate":"2016-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"\n              Crystal Structures, Stabilities, Electronic Properties, and Hardness of MoB\n              2\n              : First-Principles Calculations\n            ","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystal-structures-stabilities-electronic-properties-hardness-mob-2-firstprinciples-calculations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072037,"mean":6.8520742736971,"rank":3425535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4633385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072037,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259588,"mean":11.583612784923,"rank":101237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":157786,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259588,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9033,"mean":1.1225279007972,"rank":1209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":7805,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9033,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":415,"mean":1.1164251207729,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":415,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":3,"Chemistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"IN":1},"mendeley":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/751152834805047296","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9348245],"posted_on":"2016-07-07T20:36:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"751152834805047296"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorgChem\/statuses\/751166625609646082","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9348245],"posted_on":"2016-07-07T21:30:54+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","url":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/IC","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2249495742\/ic-twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Editor-in-Chief Bill Tolman and IC staff on fundamental studies in all phases of inorganic chemistry, including bioinorganic chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorgChem","tweeter_id":"583802897","geo":{"lt":38.91706,"ln":-77.00025,"country":"US"},"followers":5718},"tweet_id":"751166625609646082"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/waynestatechem\/statuses\/751468832783466496","license":"gnip","rt":["InorgChem"],"citation_ids":[9348245],"posted_on":"2016-07-08T17:31:46+00:00","author":{"name":"waynestatechem","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/751086734071492612\/eMY5OsA1_normal.jpg","description":"Official Twitter account for the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University, Detroit, MI http:\/\/chem.wayne.edu","id_on_source":"waynestatechem","tweeter_id":"751077006557741056","geo":{"lt":42.33143,"ln":-83.04575,"country":"US"},"followers":198},"tweet_id":"751468832783466496"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dksau136\/statuses\/753257354850807809","license":"gnip","rt":["InorgChem"],"citation_ids":[9348245],"posted_on":"2016-07-13T15:58:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr. Dhiman Kumar Sau","url":"https:\/\/www.dhimansau.weebly.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/797441444361293824\/_dJ144Xc_normal.jpg","description":"Chemistry","id_on_source":"dksau136","tweeter_id":"2294791933","geo":{"lt":22.56263,"ln":88.36304,"country":"IN"},"followers":8},"tweet_id":"753257354850807809"}]}}
