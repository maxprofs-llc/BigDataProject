We define the nanoparticle formed when the 2 drugs are bound (AR160). The newly created nATC retains the cytotoxicity of ABX and CD20 affinity of rituximab in vitro. We describe the binding characteristics of the ABX and rituximab in AR160 using peptide mapping\/Biacore approach. Flow-based methods, including ImageStream and nanoparticle tracking, were used to characterize the AR160 particles in vitro. A mouse model of human B-cell lymphoma was utilized to test in vivo efficacy of AR160 therapy, which suggested improved tumor targeting (biodistribution) as the most likely mechanism of AR160 therapeutic superiority over ABX or rituximab alone. These data suggest a novel platform for nATC delivery using a slight modification of existing cancer drugs with significantly improved treatment efficacy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Wendy K.
