Interest in the cluster and its members has been increasing steadily and the number of publications has grown exponentially since its discovery with more than 1000 articles published in 2012 alone. Originally found to be involved in tumorigenesis, research work in recent years has uncovered unexpected roles for its members in a wide variety of settings that include normal development, immune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and aging. In light of its ever-increasing importance and ever-widening regulatory roles, we review here the latest body of knowledge on the cluster's involvement in health and disease as well as provide a novel perspective on the full spectrum of protein-coding and non-coding transcripts that are likely regulated by its members.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c4","authors":["E Mogilyansky","I Rigoutsos"],"doi":"10.1038\/cdd.2013.125","endpage":"1614","first_seen_on":"2014-06-04T11:23:51+00:00","issns":["1350-9047"," 1476-5403"],"issue":"12","journal":"Cell Death & Differentiation","last_mentioned_on":1432294850,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/cdd\/journal\/v20\/n12\/full\/cdd2013125a.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24212931"],"pmcid":"PMC3824591","pmid":"24212931","pubdate":"2013-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1603","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"The miR-17\/92 cluster: a comprehensive update on its genomics, genetics, functions and increasingly important and numerous roles in health and disease.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir1792-cluster-comprehensive-update-genomics-genetics-functions-increasingly-important-numerous-rol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5131088,"mean":6.0709888111441,"rank":349015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4777645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5131088,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126659,"mean":7.9070410396502,"rank":11802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":114690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126659,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":881,"mean":5.1631340909091,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":881,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":3.2,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":51,"Student  > Doctoral Student":19,"Student  > Ph.
