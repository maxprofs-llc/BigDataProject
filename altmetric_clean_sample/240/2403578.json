Although foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) high-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) variants with an attenuated phenotype have been isolated using mutagens, no FMDV mutant with a low-fidelity polymerase has been documented to date. Here, we describe the generation of several FMDV RdRp mutants using site-directed mutagenesis via a reverse genetic system. Mutation frequency assays confirmed that five rescued FMDV RdRp mutant populations had lower replication fidelity than the wild-type virus population, which allowed us to assess the effects of the change in replication fidelity on the virus phenotype. These low-fidelity FMDV RdRp mutants showed increased sensitivity to ribavirin or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment without a loss of growth capacity in cell cultures. In addition, decreased fitness and attenuated virulence were observed for the RdRp mutants with lower fidelity. Importantly, based on a quantitative analysis for fidelity and virulence, we concluded that lower replication fidelity is associated with a more attenuated virus phenotype. These results further contribute to our understanding of the replication fidelity of polymerases of RNA viruses and its relationship to virulence attenuation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000230f","authors":["Xiaochun Xie","Haiwei Wang","Jianxiong Zeng","Chen Li","Guohui Zhou","Decheng Yang","Li Yu"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00705-014-2126-z","first_seen_on":"2014-06-04T14:17:08+00:00","issns":["1432-8798"],"journal":"Archives of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1401891387,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24888311?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24888311","pubdate":"2014-06-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Virology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Foot-and-mouth disease virus low-fidelity polymerase mutants are attenuated.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/footandmouth-disease-virus-lowfidelity-polymerase-mutants-attenuated"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3082594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":964828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106990,"mean":7.6745043322212,"rank":72532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":24837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106990,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":802,"mean":1.85977278402,"rank":460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":802,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.0225806451613,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
