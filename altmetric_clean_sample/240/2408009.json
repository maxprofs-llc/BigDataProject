A number of the analogues displayed inhibitory activity against both mycobacterial species in minimal media. Several of the molecules displayed potent levels of inhibition against Mtb, with MIC values equal to or below those observed with the anti-tuberculosis drugs D-cycloserine and isoniazid. In contrast, two of the analogues that display the greatest activity against Mtb failed to inhibit E.\u2005coli growth under either set of conditions. Thus, the active molecules identified herein may provide the basis for the development of anti-mycobacterial agents against Mtb.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e5f","authors":["Sittiwong, Wantanee","Zinniel, Denise K.","Fenton, Robert J.","Marshall, Darrell D.","Story, Courtney B.","Kim, Bohkyung","Lee, Ji\u2010Young","Powers, Robert","Barletta, Ra\u00fal G.","Dussault, Patrick H."],"doi":"10.1002\/cmdc.201402067","endpage":"1849","first_seen_on":"2014-06-05T20:39:55+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1860-7187","1860-7179"],"issue":"8","journal":"ChemMedChem","last_mentioned_on":1402000784,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cmdc.201402067\/abstract;jsessionid=98AEA03CFC38A0152A23D0F0EE40A4F8.f03t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cmdc.201402067\/pdf","pmid":"24902951","pubdate":"2014-06-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1838","subjects":["chemistry","pharmacology"],"title":"Development of Cyclobutene\u2010 and Cyclobutane\u2010Functionalized Fatty Acids with Inhibitory Activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-cyclobutene-cyclobutanefunctionalized-fatty-acids-inhibitory-activity-against-mycobacter"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6308600,"mean":5.9758905421005,"rank":4661654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":941854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6308600,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142431,"mean":7.7208839429897,"rank":93972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":27200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142431,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":792,"mean":2.204819216182,"rank":346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":792,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.1688888888889,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemMedChem\/status\/474651808376569856","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2408009],"posted_on":"2014-06-05T20:39:44+00:00","author":{"name":"ChemMedChem","url":"http:\/\/chemmedchem.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/671669464182751237\/qvZKsaL2_normal.jpg","description":"ChemMedChem is a high-impact journal from @chempubsoc_euro for research at the interface of chemistry, biology, and medicine.","id_on_source":"ChemMedChem","tweeter_id":"1725410090","geo":{"lt":49.54887,"ln":8.66697,"country":"DE"},"followers":1350},"tweet_id":"474651808376569856"}]}}
