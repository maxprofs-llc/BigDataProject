And since its introduction in the late 1970's, this process has been widely used for pharmaceutical applications to obtain clinically applicable drug delivery systems. Many adjustments and adaptations of this technique have been made, attempting encapsulation of a wide variety of bioactive compounds. The advantages and drawbacks of the single-emulsion and especially double (multiple)-emulsion techniques are discussed in the present review article. It covers patent and patent applications literature, as well as peer reviewed research papers discussing pharmaceutical polymer-based nanoparticles obtained by the double emulsion-solvent evaporation technique using preformed polymers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5323cf058f61000447c","authors":["Segundoa EP","Arzaluzb MG","Ballesterosc DL"],"first_seen_on":"2014-06-04T20:57:37+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Recent Patents on Drug Delivery & Formulation","last_mentioned_on":1401891060,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22734870"],"pmid":"22734870","pubdate":"2012-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Pharmaceutical Polymeric Nanoparticles Prepared by the Double Emulsion- solvent Evaporation Technique.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmaceutical-polymeric-nanoparticles-prepared-double-emulsion-solvent-evaporation-technique"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3845280,"mean":5.0342975113595,"rank":650262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3178322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3845280,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95968,"mean":7.4388022132609,"rank":18477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":77172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95968,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.2255454545455,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"An ichthyosaur cementery found in Chile, the aerodynamic \u2018Brazuca\u2019 World Cup ball, and Mexico\u2019s huge new aquarium","url":"http:\/\/latinamericanscience.org\/2014\/06\/an-ichthyosaur-cementery-found-in-chile-the-aerodynamic-brazuca-world-cup-ball-and-mexicos-huge-new-aquarium\/","citation_ids":[659674,2388471,2404585,2404586],"posted_on":"2014-06-04T14:11:00+00:00","summary":"Chile \nPaleontologists in southern Chile have discovered an ichthyosaur cemetery with at least 46 complete ichthyosaurs.
