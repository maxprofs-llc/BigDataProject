The P2 receptors, including P2X and P2Y purinoceptor subtypes, have been proposed to play important roles in the musculoskeletal systems since the early 1990s. During the past five years, significant progress in this field has been made; this review will summarize these most recent developments and highlight the pharmaceutical potential from these findings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a7","authors":["Wang N","Gartland A","Ning Wang","Alison Gartland"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.coph.2014.05.004","endpage":"126","first_seen_on":"2014-06-03T15:03:56+00:00","issns":["14714892","1471-4892"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1401807799,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1471489214000459"],"pmid":"24880708","pubdate":"2014-05-27T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"122","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Targeting P2 receptors\u2014current progress in treating musculoskeletal diseases","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1471489214000459","volume":"16C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeting-p2-receptors-current-progress-treating-musculoskeletal-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4784826,"mean":5.7263367103317,"rank":3191735,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1583991,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4784826,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115312,"mean":8.0072373841179,"rank":72305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":42655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115312,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":361,"mean":2.7031333333333,"rank":229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":361,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.6111111111111,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
