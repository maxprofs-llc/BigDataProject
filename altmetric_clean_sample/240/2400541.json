Two radiologists independently evaluated all masses for microscopic lipid, hemorrhage, T2-hyperintensity, T2-homogeneity, cystic\/necrotic areas, hypervascularity, enhancement homogeneity, circumscribed margins, and predominantly exophytic location. These MRI features, as well as patient age, gender, and history of RCC, were compared with pathologic findings using Fisher's exact test, unpaired t-test, and multivariate logistic regression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002856","doi":"10.1016\/j.ejrad.2014.05.016","first_seen_on":"2014-06-03T16:32:12+00:00","issns":["0720-048X"],"journal":"European Journal of Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1404754261,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=5&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ejradiology.com%2Farticle%2FS0720-048X%252814%252900252-6%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes%3Frss%3Dyes&code=eurr-site","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0720048X14002526"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ejradiology.com\/article\/S0720048X14002526\/pdf","pmid":"24882784","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Renal masses measuring under 2\u2005cm: Pathologic outcomes and associations with MRI features","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/renal-masses-measuring-under-2-cm-pathologic-outcomes-associations-mri-features"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3058970,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938493,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106810,"mean":7.6968941943097,"rank":71723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106810,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":473,"mean":1.7497542372881,"rank":265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":473,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":0.83214285714286,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":11,"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SCBTMR1\/status\/473864521376100353","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2400541],"posted_on":"2014-06-03T16:31:20+00:00","author":{"name":"SCBT-MR","url":"http:\/\/www.scbtmr.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3002800972\/515f88c7bac62a1f29a4886c8a453c6c_normal.jpeg","description":"Society of Computed Assisted Tomography & Magnetic Resonance.
