One of these strategies is to avoid activities, especially meaningful activities, which reduces positive reinforcement. Commencing significant daily activities could enable chronic patients to experience a more fulfilling life. However, the main difficulty found in FMS patients is their willingness to start those activities. Promoting positive emotions could enhance activity management. The aim of this paper is to present a description of a system along with data regarding the acceptability, satisfaction, and preliminary efficacy of a virtual reality (VR) environment for the promotion of positive emotions. The VR environment was especially designed for chronic pain patients. Results showed significant increases in general mood state, positive emotions, motivation, and self-efficacy. These preliminary findings show the potential of VR as an adjunct to the psychological treatment of such an important health problem as chronic pain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c1","authors":["Rocio Herrero","Azucena Garc\u00eda-Palacios","Diana Castilla","Guadalupe Molinari","Cristina Botella","Herrero R","Garc\u00eda-Palacios A","Castilla D","Molinari G","Botella C"],"doi":"10.1089\/cyber.2014.0052","endpage":"384","first_seen_on":"2014-06-04T11:27:35+00:00","issns":["2152-2723","2152-2715"],"issue":"6","journal":"CyberPsychology, Behavior & Social Networking","last_mentioned_on":1473276679,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24892201?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1089\/cyber.2014.0052","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24892201","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24892201?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24892201","pubdate":"2014-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"379","subjects":["behavioralsciences","psychology"],"title":"Virtual Reality for the Induction of Positive Emotions in the Treatment of Fibromyalgia: A Pilot Study over Acceptability, Satisfaction, and the Effect of Virtual Reality on Mood","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/virtual-reality-induction-positive-emotions-treatment-fibromyalgia-pilot-study-acceptability-satisfa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":51.548,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":51.548},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":180958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8161752,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178667,"mean":7.4523289937652,"rank":4899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":173767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178667,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":735,"mean":24.825291553134,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":735,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":27.070857142857,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
