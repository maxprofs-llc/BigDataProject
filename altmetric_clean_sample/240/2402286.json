(Cusco Department) and P. inca sp. nov. (Pasco Department). These two species can be distinguished from each other, as well as from the type-species, P. sinverda DeLong, 1982, mainly by features of the style and aedeagus. A key to the three known species of Platypona is provided.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008daf","authors":["CLAYTON CORR\u00caA GON\u00c7ALVES","DANIELA MAEDA TAKIYA","DANIELA MAEDA TAKIYA","GABRIEL MEJDALANI"],"doi":"10.11646\/zootaxa.3811.3.6","first_seen_on":"2014-06-04T07:33:06+00:00","issns":["1175-5334"],"journal":"ZOOTAXA","last_mentioned_on":1401867074,"links":["http:\/\/biotaxa.org\/Zootaxa\/article\/view\/zootaxa.3811.3.6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/biotaxa.org\/Zootaxa\/article\/download\/zootaxa.3811.3.6\/8750","pmid":"24943173","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":" Two new species of  Platypona  DeLong (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Iassinae: Gyponini) from Peru and key to the species of the genus ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/strongtwo-new-species-emplatyponaem-delong-hemiptera-cicadellidae-iassinae-gyponini-peru-key-species"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3845160,"mean":5.0344128879116,"rank":2149708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":984275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3845160,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95966,"mean":7.4379917261502,"rank":50459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":25212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95966,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3402,"mean":2.0124316377536,"rank":739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3402,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":1.7052839506173,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NZ":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BiotaxaNews\/status\/474090988370030592","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2402286],"posted_on":"2014-06-04T07:31:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Biotaxa","url":"http:\/\/www.biotaxa.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733682859\/biotaxa8_normal.jpg","description":"Online Library for Biological Taxonomy","id_on_source":"BiotaxaNews","tweeter_id":"454670494","geo":{"lt":"-41.3116998","ln":"174.9746507","country":"NZ"},"followers":215},"tweet_id":"474090988370030592"}]}}
