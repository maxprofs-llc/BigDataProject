This is mainly because of poor stability, surface precipitation, and limited means for property engineering of the dyes. To overcome these challenges, we develop plasmonic metal nanoparticle analogues of dichroic guest-host liquid crystals. Nematic dispersions of aligned anisotropic gold nanoparticles are obtained by polymer passivation of their surfaces to impose weak tangential boundary conditions for orientation of anisotropic host molecules. Control of the ensuing surface interactions leads to long-range ordered colloidal dispersions, allowing for collective optical and electrical switching of rod- and platelet-like nanoparticles. This facile control of mesostructured plasmonic medium's optical properties in visible and infrared spectral ranges is of interest for many applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Qingkun Liu","Liu Q","Yuan Y","Smalyukh II","Ye Yuan","Ivan I.
