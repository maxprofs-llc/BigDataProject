Contemporary science has understood this phenomenon from one aspect and Indian philosophy gives its traditional reasons based on classical texts. Modern science has recently proposed a concept of perseverative cognition (PC) as an important reason for chronic stress. This has shown how constant rumination on an unpalatable event, object or person leads to various lifestyle disorders. Similarly classical yoga texts like the Taittiriya Upanishad, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Yoga Vashistha describe stress in their unique ways. We have here attempted a detailed classification, description, manifestation, and development of a disease and its management through these models. This paper in a nutshell projects these two models of stress and shows how they could be used in future for harmonious management of lifestyle disorders.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041f7","authors":["Rajesh SK","Ilavarasu JV","Srinivasan TM","Nagendra HR"],"doi":"10.4103\/0973-1229.130323","first_seen_on":"2014-06-06T08:49:33+00:00","issns":["0973-1229"],"issue":"1","journal":"Mens Sana Monographs","last_mentioned_on":1402044546,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24891803"],"pmcid":"PMC4037893","pmid":"24891803","pubdate":"2014-06-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Stress and its Expression According to Contemporary Science and Ancient Indian Wisdom: Perseverative Cognition and the Pa\u00f1ca ko\u015bas.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stress-expression-according-contemporary-science-ancient-indian-wisdom-perseverative-cognition-pa%C3%B1ca"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3082285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":964622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107322,"mean":7.6935849274608,"rank":72739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":24933,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107322,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":3.3242268041237,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
