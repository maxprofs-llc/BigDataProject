None of these recommendations were based on actual time measurements needed for specific radiotherapy procedures. The German Society of Radiation Oncology (DEGRO) was interested in substantiating these recommendations by prospective evaluations of all important core procedures of radiotherapy in the most frequent cancers treated by radiotherapy. The results of the examinations of radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in patients with different tumor entities are presented in this manuscript.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f610008a40","authors":["Vorwerk H","Zink K","Schiller R","Budach V","B\u00f6hmer D","Kampfer S","Popp W","Sack H","Engenhart-Cabillic R"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00066-014-0634-0","first_seen_on":"2014-06-04T12:32:56+00:00","issns":["0179-7158"],"issue":"","journal":"Strahlentherapie und Onkologie","last_mentioned_on":1401884774,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24595416?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24595416","pubdate":"2014-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Urban und Vogel GmbH","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Radiotherapy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","radiotherapy"],"title":"Protection of quality and innovation in radiation oncology: The prospective multicenter trial the German Society of Radiation Oncology (DEGRO-QUIRO study) : Evaluation of time, attendance of medical staff, and resources during radiotherapy with IMRT.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protection-quality-innovation-radiation-oncology-prospective-multicenter-trial-german-society-radiat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3845280,"mean":5.0342975113595,"rank":3083347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":73979,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3845280,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95968,"mean":7.4388022132609,"rank":76387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95968,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170,"mean":1.9383431952663,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.7874,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
