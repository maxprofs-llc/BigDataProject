Ten healthy adult male Wistar rats were administrated with gastric perfusion of Bailing capsule to obtain serum containing the tested drugs. Proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells proliferation was measured using cell counting kit-8 assay. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in rat PASMCs was determined through a fluorometric assay, whereas production of endothelin-1 (ET-1) was detected by ELISA and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), c-fos, and c-jun in PASMCs was also determined using immunohistochemistry staining and qRT-PCR.\u00a0\nWe observed that the medicated serum obviously inhibited hypoxia-induced cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the medicated serum significantly reduced hypoxia-induced production of ROS and ET-1, as well as expression of PCNA, c-fos, and c-jun, in PASMCs.\u00a0\nRESULTS demonstrated that Bailing capsule can inhibit hypoxia-induced PASMC proliferation possibly by suppressing ET-1 and ROS production and by inhibiting expression of PCNA, c-fos, and c-jun. These results suggest that Bailing possess antiproliferative property, which is probably one of the underlying mechanisms of Bailing capsule for the clinical treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f610008891","authors":["Li, Xiahui","Peng, Kejun","Zhou, Yutian","Deng, Fengmei","Ma, Jiao"],"doi":"10.15537\/smj.2016.5.14953","endpage":"505","first_seen_on":"2016-05-09T10:08:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0379-5284","03795284"],"issue":"5","journal":"Saudi Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1462579811,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27146611?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27146611","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"498","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Inhibitory effect of Bailing capsule on hypoxia-induced proliferation of rat pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibitory-effect-bailing-capsule-hypoxiainduced-proliferation-rat-pulmonary-arterial-smooth-muscle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7662843,"mean":6.5825569912527,"rank":6630733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7662843,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266690,"mean":11.417606410463,"rank":222915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266690,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":404,"mean":2.5783722084367,"rank":273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":404,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.12,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/728738663283089410","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7271832],"posted_on":"2016-05-07T00:10:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":407},"tweet_id":"728738663283089410"}]}}
