Absolute configurations were assigned by utilizing 1,10-bisaboladien-3-ol stereoisomers and two gas-chromatography columns: a 25 m Hydrodex-\u03b2-6TBDM and 60 m DB-5MS. The C-6 and C-7 absolute configurations in both zingiberenols match those of zingiberene present abundantly in ginger rhizomes. Interestingly, zingiberenol 2 has recently been identified as a male-produced sex pheromone of the rice stink bug, Oebalus poecilus, thus indicating that ginger plants may be a potential source of the sex pheromone of this bug.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d8b","authors":["Khrimian, Ashot","Shirali, Shyam","Guzman, Filadelfo"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jnatprod.5b00638","endpage":"3074","first_seen_on":"2016-05-09T12:47:52+00:00","issns":["1520-6025","0163-3864"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of Natural Products","last_mentioned_on":1462624208,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26606508?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26606508","pubdate":"2015-12-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"3071","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"\n              Absolute Configurations of Zingiberenols Isolated from Ginger (\n              Zingiber officinale\n              ) Rhizomes\n            ","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/absolute-configurations-zingiberenols-isolated-ginger-zingiber-officinale-rhizomes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7662843,"mean":6.5825569912527,"rank":6630733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7662843,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266691,"mean":11.417512415163,"rank":222915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266691,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1543,"mean":3.91735538262,"rank":1312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1543,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":5.6811186440678,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
