This study examined the interaction of sweet liker (SL) and supertaster (ST) (bitter taste test through phenylthiocarbamide [PTC]) status with incidence of metabolic syndrome. Participants (n = 196) as part of baseline testing in a behavioral weight loss study completed measures assessing SL and ST status, metabolic syndrome, and dietary intake. SLs were more likely to be African American. More women than men were STs. There was a significant interaction between ST and SL status as associated with metabolic syndrome, after adjustment for demographic characteristics. This interaction was also significantly associated with fiber and caloric beverage intake. Post hoc analyses showed that participants who were only an ST or SL appeared to have a decreased risk of having metabolic syndrome compared with those who have a combination or are neither taster groups (P = 0.047) and that SL + ST consumed less fiber than SL + non-ST (P = 0.04). Assessing genetic differences in taster preferences may be a useful strategy in the development of more tailored approaches to dietary interventions to prevent and treat metabolic syndrome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fe9","authors":["Turner\u2010McGrievy, Gabrielle","Tate, Deborah F.","Moore, Dominic","Popkin, Barry"],"doi":"10.1111\/1750-3841.12008","endpage":"S342","first_seen_on":"2013-02-04T07:24:19+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1750-3841","0022-1147"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Food Science","last_mentioned_on":1417728312,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1750-3841.12008\/full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4077474\/","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1750-3841.12008\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1750-3841.12008\/abstract;jsessionid=43D1785BEB9E831D3F98915CEC18C2BB.d03t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1750-3841.12008\/pdf","pmid":"23323969","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"S336","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Taking the bitter with the sweet: Relationship of supertasting and sweet preference with metabolic syndrome and dietary intake","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/taking-bitter-sweet-relationship-supertasting-sweet-preference-metabolic-syndrome-dietary-intake"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029393,"mean":6.8051641093086,"rank":499123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7529644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029393,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299475,"mean":6.8828564883763,"rank":22995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":276437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299475,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1706,"mean":6.6188692082111,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":1597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1706,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":7.7936610169492,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
