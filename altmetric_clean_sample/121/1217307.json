Rats were randomly divided into 3 treatment groups: control, hindlimb unloading for 2 weeks (HU), and HU plus electrical stimulation for 2 weeks. The animals in the electrical stimulation group received therapeutic stimulation of the left (PC) or right (IC) calf muscles twice a day during the unloading period. Animals undergoing HU for 2 weeks exhibited significant loss of muscle mass, decreased cross-sectional area (CSA) of muscle fibers, and increased expression of ubiquitinated proteins in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles compared with control animals. Stimulation with PC attenuated the effects on the muscle mass, fiber CSA, and ubiquitinated proteins in the gastrocnemius muscle. However, PC stimulation failed to prevent atrophy of the deep layer of the gastrocnemius muscle and the soleus muscle. In contrast, stimulation with IC inhibited atrophy of both the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. In addition, the IC protocol inhibited the HU-induced increase in ubiquitinated protein expression in both gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. These results suggest that electrical stimulation with IC is more effective than PC in preventing muscle atrophy in the deep layer of limb muscles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d6f","authors":["Hidemi Fujino","Minoru Tanaka","Yusuke Hirayama","Naoto Fujita"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10735-012-9473-4","first_seen_on":"2013-02-04T16:42:30+00:00","issns":["1567-2387","1567-2379"],"journal":"Journal of Molecular Histology","last_mentioned_on":1359995430,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10735-012-9473-4"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10735-012-9473-4","pmid":"23264109","pubdate":"2012-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Developmental Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["histocytochemistry"],"title":"Comparison of premodulated interferential and pulsed current electrical stimulation in prevention of deep muscle atrophy in rats","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-premodulated-interferential-pulsed-current-electrical-stimulation-prevention-deep-muscle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505915,"mean":5.1093654012801,"rank":3113770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1017250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505915,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285682,"mean":6.0364713299099,"rank":199267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":57088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285682,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":212,"mean":0.75286255924171,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":212,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.41666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
