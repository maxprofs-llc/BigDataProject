Twenty-five adolescents with late stage posttreatment Lyme disease (symptoms > 6 months) and 25 participants without Lyme disease (matched on gender, IQ, age, socioeconomic status) were assessed for neuropsychological functioning, depression, school functioning, and predisease academic achievement. The Lyme group had significant deficits in cognition (short-term visual memory, short-term and delayed verbal memory, all forms of recognition memory), as well as worse attendance, grades, and subjective reports of memory problems, without differing in predisease achievement or depression. Deficits in visual memory exceeded deficits in verbal memory-a striking difference from what is reported in adults. These results reveal that adolescents with a history of treated Lyme disease are at risk for long-term problems in cognition and school functioning.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d83cf058f61000134b","authors":[" Patrick   McAuliffe "],"doi":"10.1080\/09084280802324473","first_seen_on":"2013-02-01T09:02:34+00:00","issns":["0908-4282"],"issue":"3","journal":"Applied Neuropsychology","last_mentioned_on":1423312682,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/09084280802324473","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18726742\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18726742"],"pmid":"18726742","pubdate":"2008-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology","neurology"],"title":"Memory and Executive Functions in Adolescents with Posttreatment Lyme Disease","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/memory-executive-functions-adolescents-posttreatment-lyme-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4724370,"mean":5.6951417795719,"rank":2105795,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2567336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4724370,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286701,"mean":6.2306480502268,"rank":110001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":172106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286701,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":3.0080952380952,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":5.7,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
