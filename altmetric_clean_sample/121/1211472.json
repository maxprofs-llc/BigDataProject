Lectins are classically used for characterising, imaging or targeting glycoconjugates and, when printed on microarrays, they are very useful tools for profiling glycomes. Development of recombinant lectins gives access to reliable and reproducible material, while engineering of new binding sites on existing scaffolds allows tuning of specificity. From the accumulated knowledge on protein-carbohydrate interactions, it is now possible to use nucleotide and peptide (bio)synthesis for producing new carbohydrate-binding molecules. Such a biomimetic approach can also be addressed by boron chemistry and supra-molecular chemistry for the design of fully artificial glycosensors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ee","authors":["Julie Arnaud","Aymeric Audfray","Anne Imberty"],"doi":"10.1039\/c2cs35435g","first_seen_on":"2013-02-01T00:16:45+00:00","issns":["1460-4744","0306-0012"],"issue":"11","journal":"Chemical Society Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1359662179,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/CS\/c2cs35435g"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2013\/cs\/c2cs35435g","pmid":"23353569","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"4798","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Binding sugars: from natural lectins to synthetic receptors and engineered neolectins","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/binding-sugars-natural-lectins-synthetic-receptors-engineered-neolectins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629240,"mean":4.9358355666342,"rank":2901481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629240,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280801,"mean":5.8248022863247,"rank":224457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":788,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280801,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":801,"mean":2.465805,"rank":622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":801,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":1.8867286821705,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
