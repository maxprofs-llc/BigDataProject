Elevations in serum calcium and magnesium levels in particular required specific therapeutic intervention. The Dead Sea has a uniquely high concentration of calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and chloride. The unusual serum electrolyte elevation that was observed in the ND victims in the Dead Sea apparently reflected the large solute load to which they were exposed. Four patients died subsequent to ND. Near drowning in the Dead Sea therefore represents a clinical entity that is associated with a high fatality rate and in which unrecognized major electrolyte abnormalities, in addition to the known respiratory complications, may influence the outcome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002307","authors":["Yagil, Y","Stalnikowicz, R","Michaeli, J","Mogle, P"],"first_seen_on":"2013-02-05T04:54:42+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0003-9926"],"issue":"1","journal":"Archives of Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1494631025,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3970646","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3970646"],"pmid":"3970646","pubdate":"1985-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Near drowning in the dead sea.
