The scope of this study is to describe the trends in the incidence of congenital syphilis in Belo Horizonte between 2001 and 2008 and determine risk factors associated with disease diagnosis. Data on cases of congenital syphilis and on the population of live births were obtained from the National Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) and from the National Live Birth Information System (SINASC), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis used the population of live births as the reference group to identify independent risk factors for congenital syphilis. The annual incidence of congenital syphilis revealed a rising trend from 0.9 to 1.6 cases per 1,000 live births between 2001 and 2008. Independent risk factors for congenital syphilis included: maternal schooling <8 years (OR: 1,3; 95% CI: 1,2-1,4); black or mixed maternal race (2,1; 1,5-2,8) and lack of antenatal care (11,4; 8,5-15,4). The strong association between the lack of antenatal care and congenital syphilis indicates that universalization of antenatal care is critical for the control of congenital syphilis. The effective control of the disease in Brazil will depend on actions to reduce social inequities in health.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Lima MG","Santos RF","Barbosa GJ","Ribeiro Gde S"],"first_seen_on":"2013-02-01T21:15:46+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Ci\u00eancia & Sa\u00fade Coletiva","last_mentioned_on":1359753340,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23358775"],"pmid":"23358775","pubdate":"2013-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"[Incidence and risk factors for congenital syphilis in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, 2001-2008].","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/incidence-risk-factors-congenital-syphilis-belo-horizonte-minas-gerais-20012008-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633425,"mean":4.921826751301,"rank":2897819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":82176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633425,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280862,"mean":5.8084622357679,"rank":224038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280862,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":385,"mean":1.105640625,"rank":250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":0.93762962962963,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HIV_Insight\/statuses\/297453185151401986","license":"public","citation_ids":[1213649],"posted_on":"2013-02-01T21:15:40+00:00","author":{"name":"HIV Insight","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/587408973\/INSIGHT_ICON_normal.gif","description":"HIV, AIDS, STI, STD, HPV, Sexuality, LGBT, et al.
