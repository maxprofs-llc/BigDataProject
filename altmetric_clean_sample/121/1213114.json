Traditionally, ileocolonoscopy is considered the reference standard for assessment of IBD. However, the procedure is invasive and requires extensive bowel preparation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an important tool for determining the presence of disease activity. Unfortunately, only moderate interobserver agreement is reported for most of the radiological severity measures. There is a clear demand for automated evaluation of MR images in Crohn's disease (CD). This paper aims to introduce a preliminary suite of fundamental tools for assessment of CD severity. It involves procedures for image analysis, classification and visualization to predict the colonoscopy disease scores.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9253cf058f61000dc6b","doi":"10.1109\/embc.2012.6346837","first_seen_on":"2013-02-01T16:35:16+00:00","issns":["1557-170X"],"journal":"Conference proceedings Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","last_mentioned_on":1359736503,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23366798"],"pmid":"23366798","pubdate":"2012-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Computational modeling for assessment of IBD: To be or not to be?","type":"article","volume":"2012","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/computational-modeling-assessment-ibd-not-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3079853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":960436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285316,"mean":6.0366399172844,"rank":195864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":55986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285316,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":792,"mean":1.2196890012642,"rank":348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":792,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":1.0683908045977,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
