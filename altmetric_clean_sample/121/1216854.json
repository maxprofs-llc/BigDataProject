It prevents the selection bias and insures against the accidental bias. It produces the comparable groups and eliminates the source of bias in treatment assignments. Finally, it permits the use of probability theory to express the likelihood of chance as a source for the difference of end outcome. This paper discusses the different methods of randomization and use of online statistical computing web programming (www.graphpad.com\/quickcalcs or www.randomization.com) to generate the randomization schedule. Issues related to randomization are also discussed in this paper.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610004008","authors":["KP Suresh","Suresh"],"doi":"10.4103\/0974-1208.82352","first_seen_on":"2013-02-04T12:43:58+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0974-1208"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Human Reproductive Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1487014316,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3136079\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3136079\/?utm_content=buffer2b798&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3136079\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4103\/0974-1208.82352"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jhrsonline.org\/article.asp?issn=0974-1208;year=2011;volume=4;issue=1;spage=8;epage=11;aulast=Suresh;type=2","pmcid":"PMC3136079","pmid":"21772732","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"8","title":"An overview of randomization techniques: An unbiased assessment of outcome in clinical research","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/overview-randomization-techniques-unbiased-assessment-outcome-clinical-research"},"altmetric_score":{"score":23.24,"score_history":{"1y":11.04,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":23.24},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204367,"mean":6.945700472644,"rank":369063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7835412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204367,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300458,"mean":6.9622995902907,"rank":16215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":284243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300458,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":4.7125777777778,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":9,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":9,"Members of the public":8,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":15,"Researcher":39,"Student  > Doctoral Student":18,"Student  > Ph.
