Forty Ss were allocated at random to CVD information or control conditions. Ss rated 2 brands of yogurt and 2 cheese sandwiches, with 1 flavor of each food labeled full-fat and the other low-fat. In fact, fat levels were identical, and the label-flavor pairings were counterbalanced. Overall, Ss gave lower liking ratings to the low-fat labeled foods. However, Ss in the information condition tended to eat a smaller proportion of the full-fat sandwiches. The results supported the utility of a laboratory setting for evaluating the influence of health-relevant information on responses to food.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f610005925","authors":["Wardle, J","Solomons, W"],"first_seen_on":"2013-02-05T23:10:06+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0278-6133"],"issue":"2","journal":"Health Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1360076280,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8020461"],"pmid":"8020461","pubdate":"1994-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Naughty but nice: a laboratory study of health information and food preferences in a community sample.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/naughty-nice-laboratory-study-health-information-food-preferences-community-sample-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":328279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":3272001,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281189,"mean":5.8380254278276,"rank":33877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":246453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281189,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":571,"mean":7.8054070175439,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":448,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":571,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":12.651402597403,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
