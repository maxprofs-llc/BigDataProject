Thirteen rugby league players were assessed for salivary-free T and C concentrations across 5 training workouts performed 3-4 days before a competitive game. The game outcomes included wins and losses and game-ranked performance (1-5) based on the number of points scored, the points differential, and a coach rating. Data were pooled across the winning (n = 3) and losing (n = 2) outcomes. Pooled free T concentrations (absolute and relative changes) were significantly (p < 0.01) elevated across those workouts that preceded winning games, but not the losses, and the relative (percent) T changes were significantly (p < 0.05) higher before winning (30.9%) than before losing (3.4%). Both outcomes were associated with workout decreases in pooled free C concentrations and the relative C changes were not significantly different between wins (-22.9%) and losses (-25.6%). In conclusion, the free T responses to selected training workouts showed some association with subsequent winning (being elevated) and losing (no change) during a limited number of competitive games in professional rugby league. Speculatively, the free T responses to a midweek workout might provide an early sign of team readiness to compete or to recovery state, thereby providing a novel format for implementing training or management strategies to improve the competition outcomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040e2","doi":"10.1519\/jsc.0b013e3182577010","first_seen_on":"2013-02-05T21:50:03+00:00","issns":["1064-8011"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research","last_mentioned_on":1426971689,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Abstract\/2013\/02000\/The_Workout_Responses_of_Salivary_Free.25.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22505132","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22505132?utm_content=buffer77982&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/2013\/02000\/The_Workout_Responses_of_Salivary_Free.25.pdf","pmid":"22505132","pubdate":"2013-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"471","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"The workout responses of salivary free testosterone and cortisol concentrations and their association with the subsequent competition outcomes in professional rugby league.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/workout-responses-salivaryfree-testosterone-cortisol-concentrations-association-subsequent-competiti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":304678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4731017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289911,"mean":6.2780415991168,"rank":21402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":268426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289911,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3057,"mean":15.495170811518,"rank":817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":2237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3057,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":23.655396226415,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":15,"researcher":3,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":15,"Scientists":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
