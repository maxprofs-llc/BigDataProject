But research on the modelling for energy metabolism of organisms just began in recent years and research on metabolic weighted complex network are rare in literature. We have made three research based on the complete model of E. coli's energy metabolism. We first constructed a metabolic weighted network using the rates of free energy consumption within metabolic reactions as the weights. We then analyzed some structural characters of the metabolic weighted network that we constructed. We found that the distribution of the weight values was uneven, that most of the weight values were zero while reactions with abstract large weight values were rare and that the relationship between w (weight values) and v (flux values) was not of linear correlation. At last, we have done some research on the equilibrium of free energy for the energy metabolism system of E. coli. We found that E(out) (free energy rate input from the environment) can meet the demand of E(ch)(in) (free energy rate dissipated by chemical process) and that chemical process plays a great role in the dissipation of free energy in cells. By these research and to a certain extend, we can understand more about the energy metabolism of E. coli.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Zixiang Xu","Xiao Sun","Jibin Sun"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0055137","first_seen_on":"2013-01-31T19:22:45+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1359660157,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0055137"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0055137.pdf","pmid":"23383083","pubdate":"2013-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e55137","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Construction and Analysis of the Model of Energy Metabolism in E. coli","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/construction-analysis-model-energy-metabolism-e-coli-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3557876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137071,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285134,"mean":6.037127852616,"rank":231480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285134,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80037,"mean":8.3320977809987,"rank":64445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80037,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6491,"mean":7.1554493066256,"rank":4994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6491,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
