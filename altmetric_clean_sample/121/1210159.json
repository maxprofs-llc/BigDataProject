This article uses a case scenario to illustrate commonly reported somatic, visceral, and neurologic symptoms and their associated health and participation impact in a female with CPP. Differential diagnosis of pain generators requires an in-depth understanding of possible anatomic and physiologic contributors to this disorder. This article provides a detailed discussion of the relevant clinical anatomy with specific attention to complex interrelationships between anatomic structures potentially leading to the patient's pain. In addition, it describes the physical therapy management specific to this case, including examination, differential diagnosis, and progression of interventions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006eef","authors":["George, Susan E.","Clinton, Susan C.","Borello\u2010France, Diane F."],"doi":"10.1002\/ca.22187","endpage":"88","first_seen_on":"2013-01-31T13:12:20+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1098-2353","0897-3806"],"issue":"1","journal":"Clinical Anatomy","last_mentioned_on":1386572437,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ca.22187\/full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23168840","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ca.22187\/pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ca.22187\/pdf","pmid":"23168840","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"77","subjects":["anatomy"],"title":"Physical therapy management of female chronic pelvic pain: Anatomic considerations","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physical-therapy-management-female-chronic-pelvic-pain-anatomic-considerations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7204226,"mean":6.3436774203992,"rank":2702774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4479518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7204226,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":294401,"mean":6.5840027241847,"rank":93865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":199121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":294401,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":497,"mean":8.2099879032258,"rank":187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":497,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":2.875,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
