The key steps in the synthetic work included an asymmetric chelation-controlled vinylogous Mukaiyama aldol reaction for the stereoselective synthesis of the syn-aldol adduct 7b and an intramolecular SmI(2)-mediated Reformatsky reaction for the formation of the macrocyclic lactam 14.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Shouliang Yang","Yumeng Xi","Rong Zhu","Lin Wang","Jiahua Chen","Zhen Yang"],"doi":"10.1021\/ol400038h","first_seen_on":"2013-02-01T14:53:15+00:00","issns":["1523-7060","1523-7052"],"journal":"Organic Letters","last_mentioned_on":1359730388,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ol400038h"],"pmid":"23368957","pubdate":"2013-01-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"130131165041002","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Asymmetric Total Syntheses of Ansamacrolactams (+)-Q-1047H-A-A and (+)-Q-1047H-R-A","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/asymmetric-total-syntheses-ansamacrolactams-q1047haa-q1047hra"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505915,"mean":5.1093654012801,"rank":2987851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1390901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505915,"percentile":30},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285309,"mean":6.0161533360438,"rank":189395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":86148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285309,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2864,"mean":3.2812190010478,"rank":1966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2864,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153,"mean":3.8869078947368,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
