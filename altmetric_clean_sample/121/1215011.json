A generalized version of the SFED model, generalized-SFED (G-SFED), is proposed here to calculate molecular solvation free energies in virtually any solvent. G-SFED provides an accurate and fast generalized framework without a complicated description of a solution. In the model, the solvation free energy of a solute is represented as a linear combination of empirical functions of the solute properties representing the effects of solute on various solute-solvent interactions, and the complementary solvent effects on these interactions were reflected in the linear expansion coefficients with a few solvent properties. G-SFED works well for a wide range of sizes and polarities of solute molecules in various solvents as shown by a set of 5,753 solvation free energies of diverse combinations of 103 solvents and 890 solutes. Octanol-water partition coefficients of small organic compounds and peptides were calculated with G-SFED with accuracy within 0.4 log unit for each group. The G-SFED computation time depends linearly on the number of nonhydrogen atoms (n) in a molecule, O(n).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Sehan Lee","Kwang-Hwi Cho","Young-Mook Kang","Harold A.
