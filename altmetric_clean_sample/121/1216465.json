The disparity raises disturbing questions concerning EMDR's aggressive commercial promotion and its rapid acceptance among practitioners. In this article, we: (1) summarize the evidence concerning EMDR's efficacy; (2) describe the dissemination and promotion of EMDR; (3) delineate the features of pseudoscience and explicate their relevance to EMDR; (4) describe the pseudoscientific marketing practices used to promote EMDR; (5) analyze factors contributing to the acceptance of EMDR by professional psychologists; and (6) discuss practical considerations for professional psychologists regarding the adoption of EMDR into professional practice. We argue that EMDR provides an excellent vehicle for illustrating the differences between scientific and pseudoscientific therapeutic techniques. Such distinctions are of critical importance for clinical psychologists who intend to base their practice on the best available research.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002575","authors":["Herbert, J D","Lilienfeld, S O","Lohr, J M","Montgomery, R W","O'Donohue, W T","Rosen, G M","Tolin, D F"],"first_seen_on":"2013-02-04T09:32:48+00:00","issns":["0272-7358"],"issue":"8","journal":"Clinical Psychology Review","last_mentioned_on":1505401376,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/11098395\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11098395"],"pmid":"11098395","pubdate":"2000-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Science and pseudoscience in the development of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing: implications for clinical psychology.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/science-pseudoscience-development-eye-movement-desensitization-reprocessing-implications-clinical-ps-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15,"score_history":{"1y":8,"6m":8,"3m":8,"1m":8,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414430,"mean":7.0825007427048,"rank":582933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7825353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414430,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301876,"mean":7.0028966095237,"rank":25274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":276432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301876,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":908,"mean":12.017190738699,"rank":180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":908,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":12.717384615385,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
