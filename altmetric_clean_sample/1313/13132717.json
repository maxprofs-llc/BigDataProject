All participants were assessed for the serum level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal examination. Participants were given a linguistically validated Arabic version of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Demographic and other medical comorbidities were assessed.\nBased on the IPSS, a subdivision of men into three symptoms classes has been proposed, resulting in groups with mild (1265, 58.3%), moderate (505, 27.3%), and severe symptoms (81, 4.4%) and the prevalence of moderate to severe was 31.7%. There was a weak, but significant correlation between the total IPSS and age, total prostate volume, and PSA. Severity of symptoms is increasing with increased age. Multiple regression analysis reported that prostate volume and all individual items of IPSS except straining were significant predictors of QOL and patient satisfaction, where frequency and incomplete emptying had the heaviest impact on patient's QOL.\nLUTS were common among men in Saudi population over 40, the prevalence increases with age and most of them were unpleased because of their urinary symptoms, poor QOL was mainly determined by individual symptoms; mainly frequency and incomplete emptying.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53b3cf058f6100046e0","authors":["Arafa","Mostafa A Arafa","Karim Farhat","Saad Aqdas","Mohamed Al-Atawi","Danny M Rabah"],"doi":"10.4103\/0974-7796.150492","first_seen_on":"2016-10-29T13:37:54+00:00","issns":["0974-7796"],"issue":"2","journal":"Urology Annals","last_mentioned_on":1477747968,"links":["http:\/\/www.urologyannals.com\/article.asp?issn=0974-7796;year=2015;volume=7;issue=2;spage=221;epage=225;aulast=Arafa"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.urologyannals.com\/article.asp?issn=0974-7796;year=2015;volume=7;issue=2;spage=221;epage=225;aulast=Arafa;type=2","pmid":"25835352","pubdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"221","title":"Assessment of lower urinary tract symptoms in Saudi men using the International Prostate Symptoms Score","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessment-lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-saudi-men-using-international-prostate-symptoms-score"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7615205,"mean":6.556701012339,"rank":3938004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2135754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7615205,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234911,"mean":12.717686024435,"rank":128769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":83792,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234911,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":3.2266666666667,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.65,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"SA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/farhatscience1\/statuses\/792358527113236482","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13132717],"posted_on":"2016-10-29T13:32:48+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr. karim  Farhat","url":"http:\/\/www.researcherid.com\/rid\/C-4085-2011","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/787288796366794752\/6Zn1Z8Q__normal.jpg","description":"PhD, science of biology and biotechnology \nImmunology and genetic of cancer","id_on_source":"farhatscience1","tweeter_id":"3887603535","geo":{"lt":25,"ln":45,"country":"SA"},"followers":33},"tweet_id":"792358527113236482"}]}}
