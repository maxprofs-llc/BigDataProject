RBV is well known to promote significant adverse events (AE). The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of treatment with LED\/SOF, with or without RBV, in patients infected with HCV genotype 1.\nWe performed a systematic review followed by a pairwise meta-analysis including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported efficacy (rapid virological response (RVR), sustained virological response at 4 and 12\u2009weeks post-treatment (SVR4 and 12), and viral relapse)) and safety outcomes (any AE, serious AE, discontinuation owing to AE, anemia and rash)). It was performed a subgroup analysis evaluating the SVR12 including only cirrhotic patients. Results were reported as risk ratios (RR) and with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).\nSeven RCTs were analyzed. LED\/SOF with RBV showed a worse safety profile when compared to LED\/SOF without RBV for the following outcomes: any AE (RR 0.56 [95% CI 0.46-0.69]), anemia (RR 0.08 [95% CI 0.04-0.17]) and rash (RR 0.35 [95% CI 0.19-0.65]). No significant differences were observed regarding serious AE, RVR, SVR4, SVR12 or viral relapse. The subgroup analysis did not show significant differences between either treatment group.\nAdministration of LED\/SOF\u2009+\u2009RBV to treatment-na\u00efve patients with or without cirrhosis, and non-cirrhotic treatment-experienced patients, did not promote significant additional benefits. Furthermore, it is still unclear whether cirrhotic treatment-experienced patients could benefit from combined therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db7","authors":["Ferreira, Vinicius L","Assis Jarek, Nayara A","Tonin, Fernanda S","Borba, Helena H L","Wiens, Astrid","Muzzillo, Dominique Ara\u00fajo","Pontarolo, Roberto","Muzzillo, Dominique A"],"doi":"10.1111\/jgh.13620","endpage":"755","first_seen_on":"2016-10-29T11:28:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1440-1746","08159319"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1493805184,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgh.13620\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgh.13620\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgh.13620\/pdf","pmid":"27785825","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"749","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1: a pairwise meta-analysis","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ledipasvirsofosbuvir-without-ribavirin-treatment-chronic-hepatitis-c-genotype-1-pairwise-metaanalysi-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150286,"mean":6.9044882123689,"rank":4081832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3860657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150286,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242129,"mean":12.972820392519,"rank":124089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":109402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242129,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1212,"mean":4.3344293971924,"rank":642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1212,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":10.118545454545,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
