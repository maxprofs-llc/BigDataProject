Model parameters were then modified to generate 35 simulations of each word corresponding to 7 different durations and 5 movement magnitude settings. In addition, these simulations were repeated with vocal tract lengths representative of an adult male and an approximately 6-year-old child.\nOn the basis of univariate analysis, measures of frequency predicted changes in magnitude, and temporal measures predicted changes in speaking rate consistent with the hypothesis. The combined effects of duration and magnitude showed that F2 was more sensitive to changes in magnitude at shorter word durations compared with longer word durations. This finding held across words and vocal tract length.\nResults suggest that there is an interaction between duration and magnitude that affects the slope of the F2 trajectory. The next step is to relate kinematics to F2 trajectory output using real speakers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f2f","authors":["Kimberly D. Neely","Kate Bunton","Brad H.
