Logit and negative binomial multivariate regression analysis were used in conjunction with rank-and-replace methods to determine factors influencing utilization and black-white utilization disparities.\nAmong Part B beneficiaries, significant disparities exist for each studied service. Examining contributing factors, 12-19 percent of the black-white health-adjusted difference in the probability of use is explained by differences in SES, whereas differences in the distribution of SI accounts for 20 percent or more. For volume, SES is found to account for 2-11 percent of differences with SI making up another 9-10 percent.\nA substantial portion of the difference in black-white beneficiary use of outpatient services is due to SI. Policies aimed at increasing coverage are likely to increase the probability of visits with modest increases in volume.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029c5","authors":["Brunt, Christopher S."],"doi":"10.1111\/1475-6773.12599","first_seen_on":"2016-11-15T23:29:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1475-6773"],"journal":"Health Services Research","last_mentioned_on":1479252561,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1475-6773.12599\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1475-6773.12599\/pdf","pmid":"27859057","pubdate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"Supplemental Insurance and Racial Health Disparities under Medicare Part B","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/supplemental-insurance-racial-health-disparities-under-medicare-part-b"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7695823,"mean":6.6062009433119,"rank":3986032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2163118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7695823,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227339,"mean":12.872762556194,"rank":125084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":81478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227339,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1184,"mean":10.85260693153,"rank":976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1184,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":9.0575813953488,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/michelleko2d\/statuses\/798669244401479680","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13653175],"posted_on":"2016-11-15T23:29:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Michelle Ko","url":"http:\/\/michelleko.faculty.ucdavis.edu","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/540210209667305472\/tuDXHaE3_normal.jpeg","description":"UC Davis Public Health Sciences | healthcare policy, access to care, social determinants | MD-PhD aka fence straddler\/student for life","id_on_source":"michelleko2d","tweeter_id":"2556125370","geo":{"lt":38.54491,"ln":-121.74052,"country":"US"},"followers":22},"tweet_id":"798669244401479680"}]}}
