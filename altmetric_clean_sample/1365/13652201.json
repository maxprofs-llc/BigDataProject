Here, we report a novel functionalized reverse phase protein array (RPPA), termed polymer-based reverse phase glycoprotein array (polyGPA), to capture and profile glycoproteomes specifically, and validate glycoproteins. Nitrocellulose membrane functionalized with globular hydroxyaminodendrimers was used to covalently capture preoxidized glycans on glycoproteins from complex protein samples such as biofluids. The captured glycoproteins were subsequently detected using the same validated antibodies as in RPPA. We demonstrated the outstanding specificity, sensitivity, and quantitative capabilities of polyGPA by capturing and detecting purified as well as endogenous \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) in human plasma. We further applied quantitative N-glycoproteomics and the strategy to validate a panel of glycoproteins identified as potential biomarkers for bladder cancer by analyzing urine glycoproteins from bladder cancer patients or matched healthy individuals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Li Pan"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.6b10239","first_seen_on":"2016-11-15T23:05:13+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci","nigms"],"issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"issue":"47","journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1480960020,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/jacs.6b10239","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1021\/jacs.6b10239"],"pmid":"27933927","pubdate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Three-dimensionally Functionalized Reverse Phase Glycoprotein Array for Cancer Biomarker Discovery and Validation","type":"article","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/threedimensionally-functionalized-reverse-phase-glycoprotein-array-cancer-biomarker-discovery-valida"},"altmetric_score":{"score":113.58,"score_history":{"1y":113.58,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":113.58},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7849747,"mean":6.6509658923939,"rank":62827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":7786962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7849747,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228886,"mean":12.905710247504,"rank":4900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":223986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228886,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18483,"mean":5.1083553727952,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":18451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18483,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":415,"mean":6.6597632850242,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":415,"percentile":99}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
