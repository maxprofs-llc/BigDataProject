Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) has been suggested as a treatment by some for the treatment of refractory bupropion toxicity. This recommendation is based largely on published case reports and cases presented at scientific meetings. The objective of this study is to characterize the outcomes of patients with suspected bupropion toxicity in which ILE was administered and the indications for its use.\nElectronic records from one regional poison center were searched for intentional bupropion ingestions from 1 January 2009 through 31 December 2015. Cases in which ILE was administered or death was listed as the outcome were further analyzed.\nThere were 1274 cases of suspected bupropion ingestion reported during the study period with 14 reported deaths. Nine cases of ILE administration were identified. Of these, four patients expired and five survived. One of the survivors had neurologic sequelae necessitating placement in a long-term care facility. Patient complications after ILE administration were common and included continued hypotension in 7 cases, recurrent seizures in 3 patients, ARDS in two patients, and renal failure in one patient.\nThe high mortality and complication rate after ILE in this study sample does not reflect the positive outcome benefit seen in previous published case reports. Further characterization of the efficacy and complications of ILE in bupropion toxicity is needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5213cf058f610003aa4","authors":["Neeraj Chhabra","Carol DesLauriers","Michael Wahl","Sean M.
