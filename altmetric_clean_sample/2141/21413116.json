Thus, the exact location of frontal lesion responsible for a specific gait disturbance is not well defined.\nWe describe a 47-year-old man who experienced two episodes of paroxysmal freezing of gait of the right leg. During the attacks, he had no motor weakness, sensory change, or disequilibrium. He had past history of panic attacks. Recently, he had been under severe emotional stress. T2 and diffusion brain magnetic resonance imaging scans were normal. So far, the most likely clinical diagnosis might be functional freezing of gait. However, magnetic resonance angiography showed atherosclerosis in the proximal left anterior cerebral artery. Perfusion scans showed a delayed mean transit time in the left mesial frontal lobe. He developed two more attacks during the four months of follow up.\nThe presented case illustrates that the mesial frontal lobe may be important in the pathophysiology of freezing of gait. We speculate that the supplementary motor area may generate a neuronal command for the initiation of locomotion that in our case may have been inhibited by a transient ischemia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007cc","authors":["Hee Won Hwang","Seung Ha Lee","Chul Hyoung Lyoo","Myung Sik Lee"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12883-017-0901-7","first_seen_on":"2017-06-29T14:14:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1471-2377"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1499103063,"links":["https:\/\/bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12883-017-0901-7?platform=hootsuite","https:\/\/bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12883-017-0901-7"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12883-017-0901-7?site=bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC5490189","pmid":"28659126","pubdate":"2017-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"122","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Paroxysmal freezing of gait in a patient with mesial frontal transient ischemic attacks","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/paroxysmal-freezing-gait-patient-mesial-frontal-transient-ischemic-attacks"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":6113159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2040117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237389,"mean":12.999774799063,"rank":155046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":68185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237389,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1262,"mean":5.3908564631245,"rank":964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1262,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":18.3010625,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"KR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BMC_series\/statuses\/880425945575956480","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21413116],"posted_on":"2017-06-29T14:01:17+00:00","author":{"name":"BMC Series","url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/p\/the-bmc-series-journals","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/786933637484834816\/pskgLf-3_normal.jpg","description":"A group of open access, peer-reviewed journals spanning biological and clinical research.
