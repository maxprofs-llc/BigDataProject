The questionnaire was then improved by suggestions from a multidisciplinary group of experts. In its final form, the survey consisted of 19 multiple-choice questions. Space was left below each question for participants to add their personal comments. Members of Italian Society of Medical Radiology (SIRM) were given 2\u00a0weeks to perform the survey.\nA total of 1599 radiologists, corresponding to 17\u00a0% of all SIRM radiologists, participated into the online survey. As a result, 62\u00a0% of participants have a positive opinion on teleradiology, while 80\u00a0% including 18\u00a0% with a negative opinion believe that teleradiology will have a future. 55\u00a0% of responders (n\u00a0=\u00a0874) use teleradiology in their clinical practice. The majority of users adopt intra-mural teleradiology for coverage of emergencies (47\u00a0%), of night and weekend shifts (37\u00a0%) or to even out distribution workload (33\u00a0%). Most responders still show concern on the use of teleradiology. In particular, they think that teleradiology is too impersonal (40\u00a0%), and that it is responsible for insufficient communication with the referring clinician (39\u00a0%).\nThe majority of Italian radiologists are favorable to teleradiology. However, they have concerns that teleradiology may further reduce communication with the referring clinician ad patient.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f6100086de","authors":["Coppola, Francesca","Bibbolino, Corrado","Grassi, Roberto","Pierotti, Luisa","Silverio, Roberto","Lassandro, Francesco","Neri, Emanuele","Regge, Daniele"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11547-016-0640-7","first_seen_on":"2016-04-25T13:23:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1826-6983","0033-8362"],"journal":"La Radiologia Medica","last_mentioned_on":1461590165,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27108418?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27108418","pubdate":"2016-04-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Diagnostic Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Interventional Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neuroradiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ultrasound","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Results of an Italian survey on teleradiology","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/results-italian-survey-teleradiology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7601780,"mean":6.5482482934541,"rank":3930419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2130240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7601780,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266778,"mean":11.404599789337,"rank":144824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":95444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266778,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152,"mean":1.5133245033113,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.8857142857143,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Computer Science":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/swmolecular\/statuses\/724587788046213120","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6946924],"posted_on":"2016-04-25T13:16:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/swmolecular.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1262877781\/MeHoldingPtsHand2_normal.jpg","description":"Safe and reliable technology","id_on_source":"swmolecular","tweeter_id":"230630176","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":2505},"tweet_id":"724587788046213120"}]}}
