We examined data on autopsy and death scene investigation (DSI) components, including key information about the infant sleep environment. We calculated the percentage of components that were complete, incomplete, and missing\/unknown.\nMost cases (98%) had a DSI. The DSI components most frequently reported as done were the narrative description of the circumstances (90%; range, 85%-99%), and witness interviews (88%, range, 85%-98%). Critical information about 10 infant sleep environment components was available for 85% of cases for all states combined. All 770 cases had an autopsy performed. The autopsy components most frequently reported as done were histology, microbiology, and other pathology (98%; range, 94%-100%) and toxicology (97%; range, 94%-100%).\nThis study serves as a baseline to understand the scope of infant death investigations in selected states. Standardized and comprehensive DSI and autopsy practices across jurisdictions and states may increase knowledge about SUID etiology and also lead to an improved understanding of the cause-specific SUID risk and protective factors. Additionally, these results demonstrate practices in the field showing what is feasible in these select states. We encourage pediatricians, forensic pathologists, and other medicolegal experts to use these findings to inform system changes and improvements in DSI and autopsy practices and SUID prevention efforts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a88","authors":["Erck Lambert, Alexa B","Parks, Sharyn E","Camperlengo, Lena","Cottengim, Carri","Anderson, Rebecca L","Covington, Theresa M","Shapiro-Mendoza, Carrie K","Alexa B.
