It is necessary to develop some sensitive but convenient detection methods for telomerase activity determination. In this study, a label-free and ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor has been fabricated to detect the activity of telomerase extracted from HeLa cells. Thiolated telomerase substrate (TS) primer was immobilized on the gold electrode surface through gold-sulfur (Au-S) interaction and then elongated by telomerase specifically. Then, it was hybridized with complementary DNA to form double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragments on the electrode surface, and Ru(phen)3 (2+) has been intercalated into the dsDNA grooves to act as the ECL probe. The enhanced ECL intensity has a linear relationship with the number of HeLa cells in the range of 5\u223c5000 and with a detection limit of 2 HeLa cells. The proposed ECL biosensor has high specificity to telomerase in the presence of common interferents. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) were <5\u00a0% at 100 HeLa cells. The proposed method provides a convenient approach for telomerase-related cancer screening or diagnosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224a","authors":["Lin, Yue","Yang, Linlin","Yue, Guiyin","Chen, Lifen","Qiu, Bin","Guo, Longhua","Lin, Zhenyu","Chen, Guonan","Yue Lin","Linlin Yang","Guiyin Yue","Lifen Chen","Bin Qiu","Longhua Guo","Zhenyu Lin","Guonan Chen"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00216-016-9561-5","endpage":"7111","first_seen_on":"2016-04-25T10:10:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1618-2650","1618-2642"],"issue":"25","journal":"Analytical & Bioanalytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1474369721,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27108278?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00216-016-9561-5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00216-016-9561-5.pdf","pmid":"27108278","pubdate":"2016-04-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Characterization and Evaluation of Materials","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Monitoring\/Analysis","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Food Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Laboratory Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"7105","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Label-free electrochemiluminescence biosensor for ultrasensitive detection of telomerase activity in HeLa cells based on extension reaction and intercalation of Ru(phen)3 2+","type":"article","volume":"408","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/labelfree-electrochemiluminescence-biosensor-ultrasensitive-detection-telomerase-activity-hela-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":6080537,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2027492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272681,"mean":11.612175128355,"rank":174391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":82246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272681,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2722,"mean":2.0179059169423,"rank":1222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2722,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133,"mean":2.6210909090909,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/724540978002989060","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6943634],"posted_on":"2016-04-25T10:10:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":726},"tweet_id":"724540978002989060"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BiosensorPapers\/statuses\/724549026285117440","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6943634],"posted_on":"2016-04-25T10:42:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Biosensor Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/706647650213363712\/BpK5-z3e_normal.jpg","description":"Pubmed Twitterbot for #biosensor papers.
