X-ray crystal structures showed that the benzo[5]helicene derivatives had highly helical twisted structures, and could all create hierarchical packing architectures with alternating P-layer and M-layer in the solid states. Moreover, seven pairs of enantiomers based on the 1,16-diaryl substituted benzo[5]helicene derivatives were also obtained by the efficient resolution through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with semi-preparative chiral columns. The enantiomers all showed clear mirror image CD spectra and high specific optical rotations, and their absolute configurations were determined by X-ray crystal structure. Interestingly, a helical nanotubular structure was formed by the self-assembly of one enantiomer via halogen bonding. Furthermore, the enantiomers were found to have high racemization barrier and thermostability, which might be caused by the introduction of aryl substituents at C1(C16) position.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Lin, Wei\u2010Bin","Li, Meng","Fang, Lei","Shen, Yun","Chen, Chuan\u2010Feng"],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201601305","first_seen_on":"2016-11-25T14:34:03+00:00","issns":["1861-471X","18614728"],"journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1480123699,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201601305\/abstract;jsessionid=FA612D0F4FA8C023A1DAD91B8A50A292.f04t04?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+26th+November+2016+from+07%3A00-11%3A00+GMT+%2F+02%3A00-06%3A00+EST+%2F+15%3A00-19%3A00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/asia.201601305?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201601305\/pdf","pmid":"27735134","pubdate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis, Structures, Resolution, and Chiroptical Properties of 1,16-Diaryl-Substituted Benzo[5]helicene Derivatives","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-structures-resolution-chiroptical-properties-116diarylsubstituted-benzo5helicene-derivativ"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7757128,"mean":6.6329627680391,"rank":5869519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1045254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7757128,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249729,"mean":12.185668639479,"rank":172207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":47462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249729,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2388,"mean":1.3743007959782,"rank":883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2388,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132,"mean":1.6465648854962,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemAsianJ\/statuses\/802158355351531521","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14052154],"posted_on":"2016-11-25T14:33:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Chem.
