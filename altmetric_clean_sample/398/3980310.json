Studies have revealed its roles in various disease, however, whether SHP-2 involves in renal fibrosis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the roles of myeloid cells SHP-2 in renal interstitial fibrosis.\nMyeloid cells SHP-2 gene was conditionally knocked-out (CKO) in mice using loxP-Cre system, and renal interstitial fibrosis was induced by unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO). The total collagen deposition in the renal interstitium was assessed using picrosirius red stain. F4\/80 immunostaing was used to evaluate macrophage infiltration in renal tubular interstitium. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay were used to analyze the production of cytokines in the kidney. Transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling stain was used to assess the apoptotic renal tubular epithelial cells.\nSrc homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 gene CKO in myeloid cells significantly reduced collagen deposition in the renal interstitium after UUO. Macrophage infiltration was evidently decreased in renal tubular interstitium of SHP-2 CKO mice. Meanwhile, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was significantly suppressed in SHP-2 CKO mice. However, no significant difference was observed in the number of apoptotic renal tubular epithelial cells between wild-type and SHP-2 CKO mice.\nOur observations suggested that SHP-2 in myeloid cells plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis, and that silencing of SHP-2 gene in myeloid cells may protect renal from inflammatory damage and prevent renal fibrosis after renal injury.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e9d","authors":["Teng, Jing-Fei","Wang, Kai","Li, Yao","Qu, Fa-Jun","Yuan, Qing","Cui, Xin-Gang","Wang, Quan-Xing","Xu, Dan-Feng"],"doi":"10.4103\/0366-6999.156121","first_seen_on":"2015-05-09T01:28:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0366-6999"],"issue":"9","journal":"Chinese Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1431134893,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25947403?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25947403","pubdate":"2015-05-09T22:06:31+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Conditional Knockout of Src Homology 2 Domain-containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase-2 in Myeloid Cells Attenuates Renal Fibrosis after Unilateral Ureter Obstruction.","type":"article","volume":"128","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conditional-knockout-src-homology-2-domaincontaining-protein-tyrosine-phosphatase2-myeloid-cells-att"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5068387,"mean":6.0044174686005,"rank":4216350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5068387,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159600,"mean":9.3557774046205,"rank":132957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159600,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":688,"mean":1.3169985443959,"rank":439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":688,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.4218181818182,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/status\/596849117172670465","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3980310],"posted_on":"2015-05-09T01:28:13+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
