Global warming and expanded range of cultivation will expose grapes to more temperature stresses in future. Our study investigated protein level responses to abiotic stresses, with particular reference to proteomic changes induced by the impact of four different temperature stress regimes, including both hot and cold temperatures, on cultured grape cells. Cabernet Sauvignon cell suspension cultures grown at 26\u00b0C were subjected to 14 hours of exposure to 34\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C for heat stress, and 18\u00b0C and 10\u00b0C for cold stress. Cells from the five temperatures were harvested in biological triplicates and label-free quantitative shotgun proteomic analysis was performed. A total of 2042 non-redundant proteins were identified from the five temperature points (data available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD000977). Fifty-five proteins were only detected in extreme heat stress conditions (42\u00b0C) and fifty-three proteins were only detected at extreme cold stress conditions (10\u00b0C). Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of differentially expressed proteins provided insights into the metabolic pathways that are involved in temperature stress in grape cells. Sugar metabolism displayed switching between alternative and classical pathways during temperature stresses. Additionally, nine proteins involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway were greatly increased in abundance at extreme cold stress, and were thus found to be cold-responsive proteins.
