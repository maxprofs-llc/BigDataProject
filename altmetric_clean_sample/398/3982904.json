Educating patients with diabetes about foot care in a home-based setting could enable the home healthcare clinician to provide information that could help reduce the risk of ulcerations and amputations. The development of an algorithm to aid clinicians in providing recommended education would enable clinicians to practice using the best-available evidence.","altmetric_jid":"567418d42a83ee1a768b4569","authors":["Rice, Jennifer","Handley, Marilyn C","Jolley, Jenny"],"doi":"10.1097\/nhh.0000000000000237","first_seen_on":"2015-05-10T19:44:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2374-4537","2374-4529"],"issue":"5","journal":"Home Healthcare Now","last_mentioned_on":1432040463,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/homehealthcarenurseonline\/Fulltext\/2015\/05000\/Comprehensive_Foot_Care_Education_in_Home_Based.8.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/homehealthcarenurseonline\/Fulltext\/2015\/05000\/Comprehensive_Foot_Care_Education_in_Home_Based.8.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/homehealthcarenurseonline\/2015\/05000\/Comprehensive_Foot_Care_Education_in_Home_Based.8.pdf","pmid":"25943220","pubdate":"2015-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"275","title":"Comprehensive Foot Care Education in Home-Based Settings: A Tool for Clinicians","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comprehensive-foot-care-homebased-settings-tool-clinicians"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5119801,"mean":6.0594419789855,"rank":2108657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2927888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5119801,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161017,"mean":9.34999150395,"rank":68053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":89723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161017,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246,"mean":0.86714285714286,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.2575757575758,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
