Antimicrobial peptoids comprise one group of potential candidates for antimicrobial drug development. The present study highlights a library of 22 cationic, amphipathic peptoids designed to target bacteria. All peptoids share same overall net charge of +4 and are 8 and 9 residues long; however hydrophobicity and charge distribution along the abiotic backbone was varied thus allowing examination of structure-activity relationship within the library. In addition, the toxicity profiles of all peptoids were assessed in human red blood cells (hRBC) and HeLa cells, revealing low toxicity exerted by the majority of the peptoids. The structural optimization also identified two peptoid candidates, peptoid 3: and peptoid 4: with high selectivity ratios of 4-32 and 8-64, respectively, and a concentration dependent bactericidal mode of action against Gram-negative E. coli.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a6a","authors":["Biljana Mojsoska","Ronald N.
