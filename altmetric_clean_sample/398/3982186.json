The eight hour intervention, Team Awareness (TA), addressing behavioural risk among employees was administered to 168 employees in the intervention arm and the 157 employees in the control arm who received a one-hour wellness talk.\nThe results show that TA had the greatest impact on risky drinking practices and hangover effects. There was a significant group X time interaction (F (1, 117)\u2009=\u200925.16, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) with participants in the intervention condition reducing number of days on which they engaged in binge drinking. There was also a significant time effect with participants in the intervention condition reducing the likelihood of going to work with a hangover (F (1,117)\u2009=\u20094.10, p\u2009=\u20090.045). No reduction in HIV-related risk behaviours were found.\nThis intervention study was able to demonstrate a modest but significant reduction in risky drinking practices and hangover effects. This provides encouraging evidence for the effectiveness of interventions that address risky use of alcohol among employed persons, further providing a launch pad for strengthening and replicating future RCT studies on workplace prevention, especially in developing country settings.\nPan-African Control Trial Registry (201301000458308).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000089d","authors":["Burnhams, Nadine Harker","London, Leslie","Laubscher, Ria","Nel, Elmarie","Parry, Charles","Nadine Harker Burnhams","Leslie London","Ria Laubscher","Elmarie Nel","Charles Parry"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13011-015-0014-5","first_seen_on":"2015-05-10T02:38:32+00:00","funders":["niehs","mrc"],"issns":["1747-597X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy","last_mentioned_on":1473650732,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25951907?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/s13011-015-0014-5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/substanceabusepolicy.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13011-015-0014-5?site=substanceabusepolicy.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"25951907","pubdate":"2015-05-10T22:07:17+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Health Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Policy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Results of a cluster randomised controlled trial to reduce risky use of alcohol, alcohol-related HIV risks and improve help-seeking behaviour among safety and security employees in the Western Cape, South Africa.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/results-cluster-randomised-controlled-trial-reduce-risky-alcohol-alcoholrelated-hiv-risks-improve-he-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":3632625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4613519,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209776,"mean":8.9054890430224,"rank":84592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":121054,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209776,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319,"mean":6.9885660377358,"rank":224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":5.9,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
