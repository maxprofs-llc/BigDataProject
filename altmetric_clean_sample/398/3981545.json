The patient was in extremis upon arrival in the emergency department (ED), and resuscitation was begun immediately. While in the ED, the problem list generated included: acute alcohol intoxication, severe lactic acidosis, dehydration, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, acute renal insufficiency, and hepatic failure. Resuscitation continued in the intensive care unit with remarkable improvement and satisfactory outcome. In this patient, the severe lactic acidosis and associated abnormalities were all attributed to acute and chronic effects of ethanol. A brief summary of the proposed mechanism by which these metabolic derangements developed and an outline of her management follows.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d74","authors":["Lien, D","Mader, T J"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0736-4679(99)00093-1","first_seen_on":"2015-05-09T16:45:43+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0736-4679"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1431189903,"links":["http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0736467999000931"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jem-journal.com\/article\/S0736467999000931\/pdf","pmid":"10499700","pubdate":"1999-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Survival from profound alcohol-related lactic acidosis","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/survival-profound-alcoholrelated-lactic-acidosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7982743,"mean":6.7354291136998,"rank":6049754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1076862,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7982743,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207162,"mean":8.7182436269376,"rank":146729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":31186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207162,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1775,"mean":6.4289875986471,"rank":1413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1775,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":8.6218518518519,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
