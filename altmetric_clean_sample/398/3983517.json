A temporal lobe high-frequency (23-36\u00a0Hz) electrical asymmetry score was calculated for each subject by subtracting the average amplitude in the left temporal region from amplitude in the right temporal region, and dividing by the lesser of the two.\nDepressive and insomnia-related symptomatology exceeding clinical threshold levels were reported by 48% and 50% of subjects, respectively. Using a cutoff value of 5% or greater to define temporal high-frequency asymmetry, subjects with leftward compared to rightward asymmetry were more likely to report use of a sedative-hypnotic medication (42% vs. 22%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Among subjects with asymmetry of 5% or greater to 30% or greater, those with rightward compared to leftward temporal high-frequency asymmetry had higher resting heart rate (\u22655% asymmetry, 72.3 vs. 63.8, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004; \u226510%, 71.5 vs. 63.0, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01; \u226520%, 72.2 vs. 64.2, P\u00a0=\u00a00.05; \u226530%, 71.4 vs. 64.6, P\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Subjects with larger degrees of rightward compared to leftward temporal high-frequency asymmetry had lower baroreflex sensitivity (\u226540% asymmetry, 10.6 vs. 16.4, P\u00a0=\u00a00.03; \u226550% asymmetry, 10.4 vs. 16.7, P\u00a0=\u00a00.05).\nIn a heterogeneous population, individuals with rightward compared to leftward temporal high-frequency electrical asymmetry had higher resting heart rate and lower BRS. Two-channel recording of brain electrical activity from bilateral temporal regions appears to hold promise for further investigation as a means to assess cortical activity associated with autonomic cardiovascular regulation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbdf","authors":["Tegeler, Charles H.","Shaltout, Hossam A.","Tegeler, Catherine L.","Gerdes, Lee","Lee, Sung W."],"doi":"10.1002\/brb3.343","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2015-05-11T01:16:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2162-3279"],"issue":"6","journal":"Brain and Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1436579742,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/brb3.343\/abstract;jsessionid=E5CC76230A7F9420D24FD1BB18717FD4.f01t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/brb3.343\/abstract;jsessionid=A935EE5857BFDFE35C46B8B340BE2562.f02t01?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+11th+July+2015+at+10%3A00-16%3A00+BST+%2F+05%3A00-11%3A00+EDT+%2F+17%3A00-23%3A00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.+However+there+may+be+a+possible+delay+so+the+start+time+may+change.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/brb3.343\/pdf","pmid":"26085968","pubdate":"2015-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"n\/a","title":"Rightward dominance in temporal high\u2010frequency electrical asymmetry corresponds to higher resting heart rate and lower baroreflex sensitivity in a heterogeneous population","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rightward-dominance-temporal-highfrequency-electrical-asymmetry-corresponds-higher-resting-heart-rat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.584,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.584},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6401454,"mean":5.9840565143566,"rank":711787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":5689735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6401454,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173754,"mean":9.248058036408,"rank":30643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":143110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173754,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269,"mean":10.574052238806,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":11.505384615385,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
