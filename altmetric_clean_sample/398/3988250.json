The objective of these experiments is usually to find a reduced set of significant features, which can be used to differentiate the conditions assayed. In terms of development of novel feature selection computational methods, this task is challenging for the lack of fully annotated biological datasets to be used for benchmarking. A possible way to tackle this problem is generating appropriate synthetic datasets, whose composition and behaviour are fully controlled and known a priori.\nHere we propose a novel method centred on the generation of networks of interactions among different biological molecules, especially involved in regulating gene expression. Synthetic datasets are obtained from ordinary differential equations based models with known parameters. Our results show that the generated datasets are well mimicking the behaviour of real data, for popular data analysis methods are able to selectively identify existing interactions.\nThe proposed method can be used in conjunction to real biological datasets in the assessment of data mining techniques. The main strength of this method consists in the full control on the simulated data while retaining coherence with the real biological processes.
