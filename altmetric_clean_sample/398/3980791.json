Because the CS was extremely short compared with the experimental period, we observed responses primarily in the absence of the CS. In contrast, most studies in the literature have analyzed responses in the presence of the CS. Therefore, the characteristics of the fear and stress responses in the absence of the CS remain to be clarified. To clarify this, we compared the characteristics of the fear and stress responses elicited by a 3-s auditory CS with those observed during a 20-s auditory CS. The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA), but not the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), participated in the fear response elicited by the 3-s CS, whereas both the BLA and BNST were involved in the response observed during the 20-s CS. Additional analyses revealed that the BNST participated in the fear response during the 20-s CS when the CS was paired with a 0.75-mA, but not with a 0.9-mA, foot shock, and during the contextual CS. In addition, the fear response elicited by the 3-s CS was more resistant to extinction than that during the 20-s CS. Finally, the 3-s CS produced more intense freezing and corticosterone secretion than the 20-s CS. On the basis of these characteristics, we conclude that the 3-s auditory CS is a more effective stressor than the 20-s auditory CS. Our findings also suggest that foot shock intensity is an additional determinant in the type of fear response induced by the CS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031aa","authors":["Kiyokawa, Yasushi","Mikami, Kaori","Mikamura, Yuki","Ishii, Akiko","Takeuchi, Yukari","Mori, Yuji"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuroscience.2015.04.055","first_seen_on":"2015-05-09T08:04:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-7544","03064522"],"journal":"Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1431158658,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0306452215004066","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25934035?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25934035","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"The 3-second auditory conditioned stimulus is a more effective stressor than the 20-second auditory conditioned stimulus in male rats.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/3second-auditory-conditioned-stimulus-more-effective-stressor-20second-auditory-conditioned-stimulus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5068387,"mean":6.0044174686005,"rank":2500804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2415113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5068387,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159601,"mean":9.3557187844613,"rank":84240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":68548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159601,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2553,"mean":3.3793181818182,"rank":1181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":1244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2553,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":8.71965625,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
