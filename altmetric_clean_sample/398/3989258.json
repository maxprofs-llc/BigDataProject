The six sequenced Geobacillus strains described here have a range of GC contents from 43.9% to 52.5% and clade with named Geobacillus species throughout the entire genus. We have identified a ~200 kb unique super-cluster in all six strains, containing five to eight distinct carbohydrate degradation clusters in a single genomic region, a feature not seen in other genera. The Geobacillus strains rely on a small number of secreted enzymes located within distinct clusters for carbohydrate utilization, in contrast to most biomass-degrading organisms which contain numerous secreted enzymes located randomly throughout the genomes. All six strains are able to utilize fructose, arabinose, xylose, mannitol, gluconate, xylan, and \u03b1-1,6-glucosides. The gene clusters for utilization of these seven substrates have identical organization and the individual proteins have a high percent identity to their homologs. The strains show significant differences in their ability to utilize inositol, sucrose, lactose, \u03b1-mannosides, \u03b1-1,4-glucosides and arabinan.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc10","authors":["Brumm, Phillip J.","De Maayer, Pieter","Mead, David A.","Cowan, Don A."],"doi":"10.3389\/fmicb.2015.00430","first_seen_on":"2015-05-12T16:54:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-302X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1432011795,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fmicb.2015.00430\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fmicb.2015.00430\/pdf","pmid":"26029180","pubdate":"2015-05-12T20:15:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Genomic analysis of six new Geobacillus strains reveals highly conserved carbohydrate degradation architectures and strategies","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomic-analysis-six-new-geobacillus-strains-reveals-highly-conserved-carbohydrate-degradation-archi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5119197,"mean":6.0597847724544,"rank":3381354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1524335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5119197,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162474,"mean":9.3000424316657,"rank":109608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":45274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162474,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3673,"mean":3.2404809368192,"rank":2118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1290,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3673,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300,"mean":2.8172976588629,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
