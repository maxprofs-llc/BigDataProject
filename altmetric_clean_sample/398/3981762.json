We examined the association between the number of pre-hospitalization defibrillation shocks and 1-month survival in OHCA patients.\nWe conducted a prospective observational study using national registry data obtained from patients with OHCA between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2012 in Japan. The study subjects were \u2265 18-110 years of age, had suffered from an OHCA before arrival of EMS personnel, had a witnessed collapse, had an initial rhythm that was shockable [VF\/ventricular tachycardia (pulseless VT)], were not delivered a shock using a public automated external defibrillator (AED), received one or more shocks using a biphasic defibrillator by EMS personnel, and were transported to a medical institution between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2012. There were 20,851 OHCA cases which met the inclusion criteria during the study period. Signal detection analysis was used to identify the cutoff point in the number of prehospital defibrillation shocks most closely related to one-month survival. Variables related to the number of defibrillations or one-month survival in OHCA were identified using multiple logistic regression analysis.\nA cutoff point in the number of pre-hospital defibrillation shocks most closely associated with 1-month OHCA survival was between two and three (\u03c7 (2) = 209.61, p < 0.0001). Among those patients who received two shocks or less, 34.48% survived for at least 1 month, compared with 24.75% of those who received three shocks or more. The number of defibrillations (odds ratio [OR] = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.38), OHCA origin (OR = 2.81, 95% CI: 2.26, 3.49), use of ALS devices (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.79), use of epinephrine (OR = 0.33, 95% C: 0.28, 0.39), interval between first defibrillation and first ROSC (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.18, 1.78), and chest compression (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.38) were associated significantly with 1-month OCHA survival.\nThe cutoff point in the number of defibrillations of patients with OHCA most closely related to one-month survival was between 2 and 3, and the likelihood of non-survival 1 month after an OHCA was increased when \u22653 shocks were needed. Further studies are needed to verify this finding.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000895","authors":["Manabu Hasegawa","Takeru Abe","Takashi Nagata","Daisuke Onozuka","Akihito Hagihara"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13049-015-0112-4","first_seen_on":"2015-05-09T20:26:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1757-7241"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scandinavian Journal of Trauma, Resuscitation and Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1430746988,"links":["http:\/\/www.sjtrem.com\/content\/23\/1\/34"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sjtrem.com\/content\/pdf\/s13049-015-0112-4.pdf","pmid":"25928051","pubdate":"2015-04-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Emergency Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Traumatic Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"The number of prehospital defibrillation shocks and 1-month survival in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/number-prehospital-defibrillation-shocks-1month-survival-patients-outofhospital-cardiac-arrest"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5056368,"mean":5.9809452245076,"rank":4205919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5056368,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158722,"mean":9.3480460934597,"rank":132109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158722,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":437,"mean":4.6904816513761,"rank":386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":437,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":5.75,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
