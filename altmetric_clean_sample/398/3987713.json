MiRNA-146a rs2910164 is a functional polymorphism that showed association with several diseases. Metabolic syndrome is an aggregation of multiple risk factors including impaired glucose tolerance, increased highdensity lipoprotein, abdominal obesity, and high blood pressure. The aim of this study was to assess the relation of miRNA-146a rs2910164 with metabolic syndrome and its component traits in Egyptian women from the Suez Canal area. The study included 100 healthy female subjects and 100 metabolic syndrome patients. The component traits of metabolic syndrome were determined and the genotypes of the polymorphisms were assessed using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique using the restriction enzyme Hpy188I. The rare C allele had a significantly higher frequency in metabolic syndrome patients (P = 0.013). The heterozygote GC and the rare CC genotypes showed a significant increase in body mass index, waist circumference, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The GC genotype was associated with higher fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin and insulin resistance. The carriers of CC genotype had significantly lower HDL compared with the GG genotype carriers. In conclusion, The C allele of miRNA-146a rs2910164 showed positive association with increased susceptibility to metabolic syndrome and its phenotypes in the study population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f610007450","authors":["Mehanna, E T","Ghattas, M H","Mesbah, N M","Saleh, S M","Abo-Elmatty, D M"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-12T08:52:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0015-5500"],"issue":"1","journal":"Folia Biologica","last_mentioned_on":1431345364,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25958310?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25958310?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25958310","pubdate":"2015-05-12T22:04:39+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Association of MicroRNA-146a rs2910164 Gene Polymorphism with Metabolic Syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-microrna146a-rs2910164-gene-polymorphism-metabolic-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5085280,"mean":6.0241177972752,"rank":4230349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5085280,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161839,"mean":9.295322495335,"rank":134559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161839,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":1.773686746988,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
