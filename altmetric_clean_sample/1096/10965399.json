First, we compare the effect of varying pulse sequence parameters on the DODE and DDE signal. Then, we analyse the sensitivity of the two sequences to the microstructural parameters (pore diameter and length) which determine \u00b5A. Finally, we investigate specificity of measurements to particular substrate configurations.\nSimulations show that DODE sequences exhibit similar signal dependence on the relative angle between the two gradients as DDE sequences, however, the effect of varying the mixing time is less pronounced. The sensitivity analysis shows that in substrates with elongated pores and various orientations, DODE sequences increase the sensitivity to pore diameter, while DDE sequences are more sensitive to pore length. Moreover, DDE and DODE sequence parameters can be tailored to enhance\/suppress the signal from a particular range of substrates.\nA combination of DODE and DDE sequences maximize sensitivity to \u00b5A, compared to using just the DDE method.
