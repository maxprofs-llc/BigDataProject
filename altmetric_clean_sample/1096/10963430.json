Stomatin is a membrane protein that is absent from the erythrocyte plasma membrane in patients with congenital stomatocytosis and is the major component of the lipid raft.\nIn a total of 68 clinical cases of HER2-positive breast cancer, the absence of stomatin expression was associated with a decreased 5-year survival (65\u00a0% vs. 93\u00a0%, p\u2009=\u20090.005) by survival analysis. For stage I-III HER2-positive breast cancer, the absence of stomatin expression was associated with a decreased 5-year disease-free survival (57\u00a0% vs. 81\u00a0%, p\u2009=\u20090.016) and was an independent prognostic factor by multivariate analysis. Negative stomatin expression predicts distant metastases in a hazard ratio of 4.0 (95\u00a0% confidence interval from 1.3 to 12.5).\nThese results may suggest that stomatin is a new prognostic indicator for HER2-positive breast cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b0","authors":["Chen, Chin-Yau","Yang, Chih-Yung","Chen, Yen-Chung","Shih, Chia-Wen","Lo, Su-Shun","Lin, Chi-Hung"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12885-016-2681-7","first_seen_on":"2016-09-01T10:27:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2407"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1472747586,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27577936?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27577936","pubdate":"2016-08-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgical Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Decreased expression of stomatin predicts poor prognosis in HER2-positive breast cancer","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/decreased-expression-stomatin-predicts-poor-prognosis-her2positive-breast-cancer-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":6308513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1125458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251801,"mean":12.497539785544,"rank":178601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251801,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3493,"mean":3.5884278350515,"rank":2228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3493,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208,"mean":6.1964154589372,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/771287914969915392","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10963430],"posted_on":"2016-09-01T10:05:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":727},"tweet_id":"771287914969915392"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TumorImm_papers\/statuses\/771385403769106432","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10963430],"posted_on":"2016-09-01T16:33:06+00:00","author":{"name":"TumorImmunoPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/741322452093931520\/rQvFtFTA_normal.jpg","description":"A TwitterBot for Cancer Immunology and Tolerance papers on #PubMed.
