Valproic acid (VPA)-exposed rat offspring have demonstrated ASD phenotypes and amygdala excitatory\/inhibitory imbalance. However, the role of glutamatergic synapses in this imbalance remains unclear. In this study, we used a VPA-induced ASD-like model to assess glutamatergic synapse-dependent long-term depression (LTD) and depotentiation (DPT) in the amygdala. We first confirmed that the VPA-exposed offspring exhibited sociability deficits, anxiety, depression-like behavior, and abnormal nociception thresholds. Then, electrophysiological examination showed a significantly decreased paired-pulse ratio in the amygdala. In addition, both NMDA-dependent LTD and DPT were absent from the amygdala. Furthermore, we found that the levels of glycogen synthase kinase3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) phosphorylation and \u03b2-catenin were significantly higher in the amygdala of the experimental animals than in the controls. Local infusion of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin into the amygdala reversed the increased phosphorylation level and impaired social behavior. Taken together, the results suggested that NMDA receptor-related synaptic plasticity is dysfunctional in VPA-exposed offspring. In addition, GSK-3\u03b2 in the amygdala is critical for synaptic plasticity at the glutamatergic synapses and is related to social behavior. Its role in the underlying mechanism of ASD merits further investigation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ec5","authors":["Wu, Han-Fang","Chen, Po See","Chen, Yi-Ju","Lee, Chi-Wei","Chen, I-Tuan","Lin, Hui-Ching","Han-Fang Wu","Po See Chen","Yi-Ju Chen","Chi-Wei Lee","I-Tuan Chen","Hui-Ching Lin"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12035-016-0074-1","first_seen_on":"2016-09-01T09:53:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-1182","0893-7648"],"journal":"Molecular Neurobiology","last_mentioned_on":1504238584,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27578017","http:\/\/dx.doi.org.sci-hub.bz\/10.1007\/s12035-016-0074-1"],"pmid":"27578017","pubdate":"2016-08-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","neurology"],"title":"Alleviation of N-Methyl-d-Aspartate Receptor-Dependent Long-Term Depression via Regulation of the Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3\u03b2 Pathway in the Amygdala of a Valproic Acid-Induced Animal Model of Autism","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alleviation-nmethyldaspartate-receptordependent-longterm-depression-via-regulation-glycogen-synthase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":6416996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1149743,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253103,"mean":12.53239676494,"rank":178420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253103,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1474,"mean":4.3910767141887,"rank":989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1474,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":7.1447368421053,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
