However, the effectiveness of these strategies in improving patient outcome is related to the rate of patient adherence. The aims of this study were to explore physiotherapists' views on the importance and perceived rates of patient adherence to physiotherapist prescribed self-management strategies; the perceived importance of methods physiotherapists can employ to aid patient adherence and the barriers to employing these methods.\nA cross-sectional web-based survey was emailed to 808 physiotherapist members of the Australian Physiotherapy Association. To maximize response rates, two reminder emails were utilized.\nIn total, 352 physiotherapists completed the survey (response rate 44%). A majority of physiotherapists (89%) believed that patient self-management strategies were important in improving patient outcomes; however, the mean perceived rate of patient adherence across all strategies was only 67%. Physiotherapists reported that there were a number of important methods that can be employed to aid patient adherence such as providing patient education and allowing time for patient practice; with minimal perceived barriers to employing these methods.\nResults indicate that physiotherapists perceive that patient outcomes can be positively impacted by patient adherence to a range of self-management strategies. Physiotherapists should be encouraged to implement into their routine clinical practice evidence-based methods to aid patient adherence. Implications for Rehabilitation Physiotherapists believe that patient self-management strategies are important for improving patient outcomes, however, the perceived rates of patient adherence could be improved. Physiotherapists should adopt a collaborative approach with their patients to address any barriers to adherence to positively impact on patient outcome. Physiotherapists perceive that there are a number of modifiable characteristics which determine patient adherence including patient self-efficacy, physiotherapist communication skills and the complexity of the self-management strategy. Methods that physiotherapists can employ to positively influence patient adherence may include individualizing the strategy to the patient, education and supplementary written information.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5233cf058f610003b92","authors":["Kerry Peek","Mariko Carey","Robert Sanson-Fisher","Lisa Mackenzie"],"doi":"10.1080\/09638288.2016.1212281","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2016-09-01T09:48:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1464-5165","0963-8288"],"journal":"Disability & Rehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1499185960,"links":["https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/09638288.2016.1212281","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/09638288.2016.1212281#.WVAgT_Mxgl0.twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/09638288.2016.1212281?scroll=top&needAccess=true#.WVuTNw2itL8.twitter"],"pmid":"27558622","pubdate":"2016-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Physiotherapists\u2019 perceptions of patient adherence to prescribed self-management strategies: a cross-sectional survey of Australian physiotherapists","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physiotherapists-perceptions-patient-adherence-prescribed-selfmanagement-strategies-crosssectional-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.3,"score_history":{"1y":4.45,"6m":4.45,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":1376339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":7082010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253128,"mean":12.533822460662,"rank":59092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":193853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253128,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1648,"mean":3.7822525804493,"rank":230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":1415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1648,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":6.5713043478261,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
