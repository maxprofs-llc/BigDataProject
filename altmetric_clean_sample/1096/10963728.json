This study explored the role of microRNA-183 (miR-183) in the protective mechanism of iPoC.\nMicroarray analysis showed miR-183 was robustly expressed in rats' livers with iPoC. MiR-183 repressed the mRNA expression of Apaf-1 which is an apoptosis promoting factor. Using an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) injury model in Clone 9 cells, hypoxic postconditioning (HPoC) and an miR-183 mimetic significantly decreased cell death after OGD, but miR-183 inhibitors eliminated the protection of HPoC. The increased expression of Apaf-1 and the downstream activation of capsase-3\/9 after OGD were mitigated by HPoC or the addition of miR-183 mimetics, whereas miR-183 inhibitor diminished the effect of HPoC on Apaf-1-caspase signaling. In the in vivo experiment, ischemic postconditioning and agomiR-183 decreased the expression of serum ALT after liver IR in the mice, but antagomiR-183 mitigated the effect of iPoC. The results of H&E and TUNEL staining were compatible with the biochemical assay. Moreover, iPoC and agomiR-183 decreased the expression of Apaf-1 and 4-HNE after IR injury in mouse livers, whereas the antagomiR-mediated prevention of miR-183 expression led to increased protein expression of Apaf-1 and 4-HNE in the post-ischemic livers.\nOur experiment showed the first time that miR-183 was induced in protective postconditioning and reduced reperfusion injury of the livers via the targeting of apoptotic signaling.\nMiR-183 mediated the tolerance induced by ischemic postconditioning in livers via Apaf-1 repressing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022ba","authors":["Lin, Han-Chen","Liu, Shin-Yun","Yen, Er-Yen","Li, Tsai-Kun","Lai, I-Rue"],"doi":"10.1089\/ars.2016.6679","first_seen_on":"2016-09-01T10:32:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-7716","1523-0864"],"journal":"Antioxidants & Redox Signaling","last_mentioned_on":1472724974,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27580417?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27580417","pubdate":"2016-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"MicroRNA-183 mediates protective postconditioning of the liver by repressing Apaf-1","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna183-mediates-protective-postconditioning-liver-repressing-apaf1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":7188730,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251801,"mean":12.497832081016,"rank":211322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251801,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":831,"mean":3.3385397590361,"rank":615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":831,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":8.8821904761905,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/771290560896172032","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10963728],"posted_on":"2016-09-01T10:16:14+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
