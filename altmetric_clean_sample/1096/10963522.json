Specifically, we asked, whether the presence of the highly immunogenic NP-epitope in T-AgNP influences this response in comparison to the weakly immunogenic T-cell epitopes of T-Ag in WAP-T tumor mice. Treatment of WAP-TNP tumor mice with either anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies led to tumor regression, with anti-PD-L1 treatment being more effective. However, tumors had fully re-appeared after 21 days, indicating that CTL exhaustion had been rapidly re-established. Surprisingly, the same treatment applied to WAP-T tumor mice resulted in a significantly prolonged period of tumor regression. We provide evidence that in contrast to the weak antigenic stimuli exerted by T-cell epitopes of T-Ag, the strong antigenic stimulus of the NP-epitope in T-AgNP has a dual effect: (i) a rapid generation of active NP-specific CTLs, accompanied (ii) by accelerated CTL exhaustion. Our data support the hypothesis that the immunogenicity of tumor antigen T-cell epitopes strongly influences the success of immune checkpoint blockade therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Bruns, Michael","Wanger, Jara","Schumacher, Udo","Deppert, Wolfgang"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.11620","first_seen_on":"2016-09-01T10:29:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1472794405,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27579535?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27579535?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27579535","pubdate":"2014-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"T-cell epitope strength in WAP-T mouse mammary carcinomas is an important determinant in PD1\/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tcell-epitope-strength-wapt-mouse-mammary-carcinomas-important-determinant-pd1pdl1-immune-checkpoint"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":3939097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4193485,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251841,"mean":12.497377088627,"rank":117653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":126305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251841,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8829,"mean":3.1533944268237,"rank":1803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8829,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290,"mean":6.9638823529412,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/771288546984341504","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10963522],"posted_on":"2016-09-01T10:08:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":727},"tweet_id":"771288546984341504"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TumorImm_papers\/statuses\/771327016633180160","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10963522],"posted_on":"2016-09-01T12:41:05+00:00","author":{"name":"TumorImmunoPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/741322452093931520\/rQvFtFTA_normal.jpg","description":"A TwitterBot for Cancer Immunology and Tolerance papers on #PubMed.
