Endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification was detected by FISH, and its association with chromosome 7 abnormalities was analyzed. Mean PTEV of each group was compared by ANOVA to evaluate the relationship between PTEV and cytogenetic complexity.\nThe PTEV of patients in normal (n=6), NCK (n=8), and CK (n=13) groups were 24.52\u00b117.73, 34.26\u00b135.04, and 86.31\u00b148.7 cm\u00b3, respectively (P=0.005). Ten out of 11 patients with EGFR amplification showed abnormalities in chromosome 7. The mean PTEV of EGFR-amplified and non-amplified groups were 80.4\u00b153.7 and 41.3\u00b137.9 cm\u00b3, respectively (P=0.035). The average survival of patients with PTEV less than 90 cm\u00b3 was 30.52\u00b126.11 months, while in patients with PTEVs over or equal to 90 cm\u00b3, it was 10.83\u00b15.53 months (P=0.007).\nThe results show an association of complex karyotype with the PTEV of high-grade astrocytoma. EGFR amplification plays a significant role in the formation of peritumoral edema, causing PTEV to increase, which is related with survival. This implies that cytogenetic karyotype can be applied as a prognostic factor.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbcd","authors":["Jeong, Kyung Ho","Song, Young Jin","Han, Jin Yeong","Kim, Ki Uk"],"doi":"10.3343\/alm.2016.36.6.583","first_seen_on":"2016-09-01T11:09:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2234-3814","2234-3806"],"issue":"6","journal":"Annals of Laboratory Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1472727484,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27578512?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27578512?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27578512","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"583","subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Relationship Between Cytogenetic Complexity and Peritumoral Edema in High-Grade Astrocytoma","type":"article","volume":"36"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":6308546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1125403,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251802,"mean":12.497730819178,"rank":178618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251802,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149,"mean":1.2567297297297,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/librarian123456\/statuses\/771301088272146432","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10964249],"posted_on":"2016-09-01T10:58:04+00:00","author":{"name":"urmyuniverse","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_0_normal.png","id_on_source":"librarian123456","tweeter_id":"285939976","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":62},"tweet_id":"771301088272146432"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/librarian123456\/statuses\/771301091468152832","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10964249],"posted_on":"2016-09-01T10:58:04+00:00","author":{"name":"urmyuniverse","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_0_normal.png","id_on_source":"librarian123456","tweeter_id":"285939976","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":62},"tweet_id":"771301091468152832"}]}}
