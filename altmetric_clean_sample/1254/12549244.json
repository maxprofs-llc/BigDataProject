Transcatheter deployment of the MitraClip device may be considered for patients who are not suitable for conventional surgery. A total of 567 patients with significant mitral regurgitation (MR) underwent MitraClip therapy. Of those, 393 had functional MR (FMR) and were subdivided by preprocedural LVEF (A: 10% to 20%, B: >20% to 30%, C: >30% to 40%, D: >40%). Procedural safety and efficacy and treatment outcomes including MR grade, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, 6-minute walk test, and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire were analyzed at baseline, 30\u00a0days, and 12\u00a0months. Baseline mean logistic EuroSCORE was 25 \u00b1 19; 87% of patients were in NYHA classes III or IV (A: 96%, B: 83%, C: 90%, D: 86%). There was no incidence of death or stroke intraprocedurally. Eleven patients died within 30\u00a0days with no differences among subgroups. Kaplan-Meier survival at 12\u00a0months was 81.8% (A: 71%, B: 79%, C: 87%, D: 86%). There was a significant improvement in MR severity at 30\u00a0days and 12\u00a0months (p <0.0001). At 12\u00a0months, all subgroups experienced similar improvements in NYHA class, 6-minute walk test, and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. This real-world registry reports promising results of MitraClip therapy in patients with FMR. In conclusion, the low rates of hospital mortality and adverse events in patients with FMR-even in patients with severely reduced LVEF-provide additional evidence of substantial benefits after MitraClip implantation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f0","authors":["Sch\u00e4fer, Ulrich","Maisano, Francesco","Butter, Christian","Franzen, Olaf","Baldus, Stephan","Hausleiter, J\u00f6rg","Ussia, Gian Paolo","Sievert, Horst","Geist, Volker","Widder, Julian Daniel","Moccetti, Tiziano","Schillinger, Wolfgang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjcard.2016.06.036","endpage":"880","first_seen_on":"2016-10-10T22:22:03+00:00","issns":["1879-1913","00029149"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1476138046,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.amjcard.2016.06.036"],"pmid":"27575279","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"873","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Impact of Preprocedural Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction on 1-Year Outcomes After MitraClip Implantation (from the ACCESS-EU Phase I, a Prospective, Multicenter, Nonrandomized Postapproval Study of the MitraClip Therapy in Europe)","type":"article","volume":"118","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-preprocedural-left-ventricular-ejection-fraction-1year-outcomes-after-mitraclip-implantation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7520778,"mean":6.5030037002784,"rank":1027021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6427235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7520778,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239634,"mean":12.453232250984,"rank":50366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":185839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239634,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3825,"mean":4.6632180962343,"rank":546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3825,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":9.2621694915254,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
