The effect of lower REE after the procedure on long-term weight remains to be elucidated.\nTo evaluate the effects of RYGB on REE and body composition 6 months after RYGB and to find out whether postsurgery REE affects weight at 12 and 18 months SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital, southern Brazil METHOD: A prospective study involving 30 RYGB patients aged>18 years was performed. Body composition was evaluated by X-ray absorptiometry and REE by indirect calorimetry. All patients were assessed before RYGB and 6 months postoperatively. Further analysis of weight was carried out at 12 and 18 months.\nBaseline body mass index was 49\u00b19 kg\/m\u00b2 and mean weight was 128\u00b119 kg, half of which comprised fat mass (50\u00b15%). Baseline mean REE was 2297\u00b1182 kcal\/d. The percent total weight loss was 26\u00b17%, 32\u00b19%, and 34\u00b19% at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively. The percent excess weight loss gradually increased from 54 \u00b1 12% at 6 months, to 67 \u00b1 18% at 12 months, and 71 \u00b1 19% at 18 months. REE was significantly lower at follow-up (-405\u00b1108 kcal\/d; P<.001). Furthermore, an inverse correlation between REE at 6 months and percent excess weight loss at 18 months (r =-.612; P = .035) was observed in the subgroup of patients whose REE decreased>405 kcal\/d at 6 months.\nPatients undergoing RYGB who had a substantial drop in REE at 6 months may exhibit less long-term weight loss.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008a99","authors":["Moehlecke, Milene","Andriatta Blume, Carina","Rheinheimer, Jakeline","Maciel Trindade, Manoel Roberto","Crispim, Daisy","Bauermann Leit\u00e3o, Cristiane"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.soard.2016.08.027","first_seen_on":"2016-10-10T20:56:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-7533","15507289"],"journal":"Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1476132985,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27692914\/?i=4&from=surg%20obes%20relat%20dis%20aug%202016#fft"],"pmid":"27692914","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"Early reduction of resting energy expenditure and successful weight loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/early-reduction-resting-energy-expenditure-successful-weight-loss-after-rouxeny-gastric-bypass-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7520778,"mean":6.5030037002784,"rank":6514743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7520778,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239635,"mean":12.453214502116,"rank":197443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239635,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":658,"mean":2.7936438356164,"rank":445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":658,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":3.4409090909091,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/asmbs\/statuses\/785584795183095808","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12546903],"posted_on":"2016-10-10T20:56:25+00:00","author":{"name":"ASMBS","url":"http:\/\/www.asmbs.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/826155401708187648\/Np-cSpCC_normal.jpg","description":"Official Twitter account of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery","id_on_source":"asmbs","tweeter_id":"22690192","geo":{"lt":29.65163,"ln":-82.32483,"country":"US"},"followers":21274},"tweet_id":"785584795183095808"}]}}
