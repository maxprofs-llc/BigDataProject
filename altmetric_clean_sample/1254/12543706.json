The development of more sophisticated techniques for assessing and preventing protein synthesis has renewed interest in this long-standing question in recent years. In this issue of Journal of Bacteriology, Korza et al address this with a novel approach. We discuss their results in the context of recently published data.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cba","authors":["Tyler Boone","Adam Driks"],"doi":"10.1128\/jb.00721-16","first_seen_on":"2016-10-10T18:58:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-5530"],"journal":"Journal of Bacteriology","last_mentioned_on":1479486358,"links":["http:\/\/jb.asm.org\/content\/early\/2016\/10\/05\/JB.00721-16.abstract","http:\/\/jb.asm.org\/content\/198\/24\/3251.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jb.asm.org\/content\/early\/2016\/10\/05\/JB.00721-16.full.pdf","pmid":"27736794","pubdate":"2016-10-14T22:01:13+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"JB.00721-16","subjects":["bacteriology"],"title":"Protein synthesis during germination: shedding new light on a classical question","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protein-synthesis-during-germination-shedding-new-light-classical-question"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7711682,"mean":6.6148164461077,"rank":5831211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1040840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7711682,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243931,"mean":12.457148813184,"rank":170295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243931,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4143,"mean":3.306473201352,"rank":3496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4143,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":4.694262295082,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
