No doubt, data volume and diversity have dramatically increased by the advent of new technologies and open data initiatives. Big data are used across the whole drug discovery pipeline from target identification and mechanism of action to identification of novel leads and drug candidates. Such methods are depicted and discussed, with the aim to provide a general view of computational tools and databases available. We feel that big data leveraging needs to be cost-effective and focus on personalized medicine. For this, we propose the interplay of information technologies and (chemo)informatic tools on the basis of their synergy.","altmetric_jid":"537f30852a83eeb45a8b45a1","authors":["Theodora Katsila","Georgios A.
