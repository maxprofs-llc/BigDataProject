To maintain a stable percept of the world, visual representations must be updated with each saccade. Near the time of a saccade, neurons in several visual areas become sensitive to the regions of visual space that their receptive fields occupy after the saccade. This process, known as remapping, transfers information from one set of neurons to another, and may provide a mechanism for visual stability. However, it is not clear whether remapping transfers information about stimulus features in addition to information about stimulus location. To investigate this issue, we recorded blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses while human subjects viewed images of faces and houses (two visual categories with many feature differences). Immediately after some image presentations, subjects made a saccade that moved the previously stimulated location to the opposite side of the visual field. We then used a combination of univariate analyses and multivariate pattern analyses to test whether information about stimulus location and stimulus features were remapped to the ipsilateral hemisphere after the saccades. We found no reliable indication of stimulus feature remapping in any region. However, we also found no reliable indication of stimulus location remapping, despite the fact that our paradigm was highly similar to previous fMRI studies of remapping. The absence of location remapping in our study precludes strong conclusions regarding feature remapping. However, these results also suggest that measurement of location remapping with fMRI depends strongly on the details of the experimental paradigm used. We highlight differences in our approach from the original fMRI studies of remapping, discuss potential reasons for the failure to generalize prior location remapping results, and suggest directions for future research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc1d","authors":["Lescroart, Mark D.","Kanwisher, Nancy","Golomb, Julie D.","Lescroart, Mark D","Golomb, Julie D"],"doi":"10.3389\/fnsys.2016.00053","first_seen_on":"2016-06-13T08:29:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1662-5137"],"journal":"Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1473273715,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fnsys.2016.00053\/full?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fnsys.2016.00053\/full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27378866?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fnsys.2016.00053\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4904027","pmid":"27378866","pubdate":"2016-06-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"No Evidence for Automatic Remapping of Stimulus Features or Location Found with fMRI","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidence-automatic-remapping-stimulus-features-location-found-fmri"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":1806546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6525040,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271437,"mean":11.639470335548,"rank":74050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":196818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271437,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":757,"mean":8.7060978835979,"rank":223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":757,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":4.2752,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
