Despite the widely reported lower BMI and body weight in girls with AIS, the body composition of these patients was not thoroughly studied with sufficient sample size. Leptin is an important factor in regulating energy and bone metabolism, and has been postulated as one of the etiologic factors of AIS.\n148 AIS and 116 control girls aged 12 to 14 were recruited. Body composition was measured with bioelectrical impedance analysis. Caloric intake and physical activity level were assessed by food frequency and Baecke questionnaires respectively. Serum total leptin and sOB-R levels were measured with ELISA, and free leptin index was calculated.\nAIS girls had lower body weight and BMI, other anthropometric and sexual maturity parameters were comparable with controls. There were no difference in caloric intake and physical activity levels. After adjustment for physical activity level, AIS girls had lower skeletal muscle mass, lower body fat and %body fat. Higher sOB-R and lower free leptin index were found in AIS girls after adjusted for age and body weight. Weaker correlations between serum total leptin, FLI, and body composition parameters were observed in AIS girls.\nResults suggested that the lower body weight in AIS girls were contributed by both lower skeletal muscle mass and lower body fat. Altered leptin bioavailability also exist in AIS girls and could lead to lower body weight, lower BMI, and abnormal body composition that were manifested in AIS simultaneously.\n4.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a7","authors":["Tam, Elisa M.
