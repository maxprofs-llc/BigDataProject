Interestingly, two types of linkages, Ln-O-C and B-O-C bonds, exist in the structures, showing firstly novel linking modes between inorganic polyborate and organic dicarboxylate.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Guo-Yu Yang","Lei-Lei Li","Rui Pan","Junwei Zhao","Bai-Feng Yang","Jun-Wei Zhao"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6dt01909a","endpage":"11632","first_seen_on":"2016-06-13T10:49:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"29","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1465807752,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/DT\/C6DT01909A?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/dt\/c6dt01909a","pmid":"27332080","pubdate":"2016-06-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"11628","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Two novel pillared-layer lanthanide borates built by Ln@B12O28\/29 ring clusters and dicarboxylate linkers (Ln = Pr, Nd)","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/two-novel-pillaredlayer-lanthanide-borates-built-lnb-sub12sub-o-sub2829sub-ring-clusters-dicarboxyla"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7890722,"mean":6.6811441707233,"rank":6832593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7890722,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267818,"mean":11.457710227506,"rank":223369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267818,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11000,"mean":0.68793235748704,"rank":3102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11000,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":513,"mean":0.71552734375,"rank":152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":513,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Chemical Engineering":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/742277629068214273","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8699772],"posted_on":"2016-06-13T08:49:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"742277629068214273"}]}}
