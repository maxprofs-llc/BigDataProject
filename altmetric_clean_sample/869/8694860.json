Ninety-four participants volunteered and were categorized into perceived ankle instability (PI) alone (n\u00a0=\u00a013), recurrent ankle sprains (RAS) alone (n\u00a0=\u00a012), PI in combination with RAS (PI-RAS; n\u00a0=\u00a025), LAS-Copers (n\u00a0=\u00a018), and controls (n\u00a0=\u00a026). Participants completed self-assessed global, regional, and psychological health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) questionnaires and assessments of sensorimotor function and mechanical joint laxity. One-way ANOVAs were performed with the intention of reducing the number of original outcomes into a smaller number of predictor variables. Discriminant functional analysis was used to establish which specific measures best differentiate between groups. Eight outcome measures from neural excitability, postural control, static postural control, and HRQOL showed a significant differentiation between five groups (Wilk's \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a00.26, \u03c7(2) 32 \u00a0=\u00a0114\u00a045, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, canonical correlation\u00a0=\u00a00.80) and correctly determined only 58.1% of group membership, and the PI-RAS and control groups were the only fit in the\u00a0proposed model. A different model or other sensorimotor outcomes from more dynamic and complex tasks may be needed for the PI, RAS, and LAS-Coper groups.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034c5","authors":["Terada, M.","Bowker, S.","Hiller, C.
