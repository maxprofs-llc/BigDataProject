This sensor was used to analyze agonist-dependent internalization of \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptors. It was also used as a surrogate antigen to reveal direct surface-to-endosome antigen transfer between dendritic cells (not shown).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Grover, Anmol","Schmidt, Brigitte F.","Salter, Russell D.","Watkins, Simon C.","Waggoner, Alan S.","Bruchez, Marcel P.","Anmol Grover","Brigitte F.
