Recently it has been shown that both motor and cognitive functions can be influenced by tDCS. Here, we tested the effect of tDCS on the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal evoked by coherent visual motion using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003475","authors":["Antal A","Kov\u00e1cs G","Chaieb L","Cziraki C","Paulus W","Greenlee MW"],"doi":"10.3233\/rnn-2012-110208","first_seen_on":"2012-04-24T20:48:02+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Restorative Neurology & Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1335299805,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22475855?dopt=Citation"],"pmid":"22475855","pubdate":"2012-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Cathodal stimulation of human MT+ leads to elevated fMRI signal: A tDCS-fMRI study.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cathodal-stimulation-human-mt-leads-elevated-fmri-signal-tdcsfmri-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":2327087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1536401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75453,"mean":4.4346248475852,"rank":33072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":30919,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75453,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146,"mean":5.2948827586207,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":4.4166666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
