However, the precise role of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) in these processes is not well understood. We generated Cdk2 and Cdk4 double knockout (DKO) mice and found a striking ablation of the intermediate zone and cortical plate in mouse embryonic brain. When neural stem cells (NSCs) were isolated and analyzed, DKO NSCs proliferated comparable to wild type as Cdk1 now binds to cyclin D1 and E1 and assumes the role vacated by the loss of Cdk2 and Cdk4 in phosphorylating Rb. Although compensation was sufficient for the maintenance of self-renewal and multilineage potential, DKO NSCs displayed an altered cell cycle profile and were more prone to neuronal differentiation. This was manifested in vivo as a marked reduction in S-phase length and an increased tendency for neurogenic divisions that prevented proper expansion of the basal progenitor pool. Our data thus demonstrate the induction of neurogenic divisions in the absence of critical mediators of G1\/S transition-Cdk2 and Cdk4, and highlight their evolutionary importance in the determination of cortical thickness.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f610008a36","authors":["Lim, Shuhui","Kaldis, Philipp"],"doi":"10.1002\/stem.1114","endpage":"1520","first_seen_on":"2012-04-24T20:31:37+00:00","issns":["1549-4918","1066-5099"],"issue":"7","journal":"Stem Cells","last_mentioned_on":1335961694,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/stem.1114&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/stem.1114","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/stem.1114\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/stem.1114\/pdf","pmid":"22532528","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1509","subjects":["embryology","cellbiology"],"title":"Loss of Cdk2 and Cdk4 Induces a Switch from Proliferation to Differentiation in Neural Stem Cells","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/loss-cdk2-cdk4-induces-switch-proliferation-differentiation-neural-stem-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6387788,"mean":5.9823105998994,"rank":2617427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3627031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6387788,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82359,"mean":4.9381182155953,"rank":30541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":49197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82359,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1439,"mean":5.0719137691238,"rank":588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":784,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1439,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.1166666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
