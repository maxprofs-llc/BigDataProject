Here, we focused on the role of protein-tyrosine phosphatase signaling in convergence and extension cell movements. We identified Ptpn20 as a structural paralogue of PTP-BL and both phosphatases were required for normal gastrulation cell movements. Interestingly, knockdowns of PTP-BL and Ptpn20 evoked similar developmental defects as knockdown of RPTP\u03b1 and PTP\u03b5. Co-knockdown of RPTP\u03b1 and PTP-BL, but not Ptpn20, had synergistic effects and conversely, PTP\u03b5 and Ptpn20, but not PTP-BL, cooperated, demonstrating the specificity of our approach. RPTP\u03b1 and PTP\u03b5 knockdowns were rescued by constitutively active RhoA, whereas PTP-BL and Ptpn20 knockdowns were rescued by dominant negative RhoA. Consistently, RPTP\u03b1 and PTP-BL had opposite effects on RhoA activation, both in a PTP-dependent manner. Downstream of the PTPs, we identified NGEF and Arhgap29, regulating RhoA activation and inactivation, respectively, in convergence and extension cell movements. We propose a model in which two phosphatases activate RhoA and two phosphatases inhibit RhoA, resulting in proper cell polarization and normal convergence and extension cell movements.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E5913V","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Mark van Eekelen","Vincent Runtuwene","Wouter Masselink","Jeroen den Hertog","van Eekelen M","Runtuwene V","Masselink W","den Hertog J"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0035913","first_seen_on":"2012-04-26T20:49:20+00:00","issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1335472819,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035913"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0035913.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3335823","pmid":"22545146","pubdate":"2012-04-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e35913","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Pair-Wise Regulation of Convergence and Extension Cell Movements by Four Phosphatases via RhoA","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pairwise-regulation-convergence-extension-cell-movements-four-phosphatases-via-rhoa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6375759,"mean":5.9877677907471,"rank":4482936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1661555,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6375759,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82191,"mean":4.9594477673683,"rank":48978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":29536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82191,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98654,"mean":9.7927598957964,"rank":67384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":26638,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98654,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2928,"mean":7.5272456440041,"rank":2058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":728,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2928,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
