We determined the occurrence of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, using culture-based methods and PCRs targeting virulence-associated genes (VAGs) among children aged \u226414 years who were treated for diarrhoea at emergency rooms in northeastern Brazil. Genomic DNA was extracted directly from stool samples collected from 366 children. A questionnaire was also applied to qualify the clinical conditions presented by each child at the time of admission. C. jejuni and C. coli were detected in 16.4\u200a% (60\/366) and 1.4\u200a% (5\/366) of the diarrhoeal samples, respectively, by PCR, a much higher proportion than that detected by conventional methods. C. jejuni VAGs were detected in the following proportions of hipO-positive samples: ciaB, 95\u200a% (57\/60); dnaJ, 86.7\u200a% (52\/60); racR, 98.3\u200a% (59\/60); flaA, 80\u200a% (48\/60); pldA, 45\u200a% (27\/60); cdtABC, 95\u200a% (57\/60); and pVir 0\u200a% (0\/60). Particular symptoms, such as blood in faeces, vomiting, fever, and\/or abdominal pain, were not associated with detection of C. jejuni nor were they associated with any particular VAG or combination of VAGs (P>0.05). C. jejuni and its VAGs were detected in a substantial proportion of the children admitted. Further efforts shall be directed towards elucidating whether these genetic factors or their expressed proteins play a role in Campylobacter pathogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d51","authors":["Quetz JD","Lima IF","Havt A","Prata MD","Cavalcante PA","Medeiros PH","Cid DA","Moraes ML","Rey LC","Soares AM","Mota RM","Weigl BH","Guerrant RL","Lima AA"],"doi":"10.1099\/jmm.0.040600-0","first_seen_on":"2012-04-26T10:32:02+00:00","issns":["0022-2615"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Medical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1335435962,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22174372?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22174372","pubdate":"2011-12-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Campylobacter jejuni infection and its virulence associated genes among children with moderate to severe diarrhea attended at emergency rooms in Northeastern Brazil.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/campylobacter-jejuni-infection-virulenceassociated-genes-children-moderate-severe-diarrhoea-admitted"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3083670,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":967839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75630,"mean":4.456685213344,"rank":47108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":17414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75630,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":606,"mean":2.1597256198347,"rank":356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":606,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
