The deintercalation of oxide ions from the central MnO(1.5) layer of the starting phase is accompanied by a rearrangement of the anion lattice, resulting in a layer of composition MnO(0.5) in the reduced material, consisting of chains of MnO(4) tetrahedra connected by edge and corner sharing. Magnetization and low-temperature neutron diffraction data are consistent with antiferromagnetic coupling of manganese spins, but no long-range magnetic order is observed down to 5 K, presumably due to the large interlayer separation in the reduced phase. The influence of anion substitution on the structural selectivity of low-temperature reduction reactions is discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Fabio Denis Romero"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic300258f","first_seen_on":"2012-04-23T18:09:45+00:00","issns":["0020-1669"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1335204552,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/ic300258f?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pmid":"22524283","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Structure and Magnetism of the Topotactically Reduced Oxychloride Sr4Mn3O6.5Cl2","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structure-magnetism-topotactically-reduced-oxychloride-sr4mn3o65cl2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3561030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75492,"mean":4.5245845729954,"rank":60678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75492,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5999,"mean":1.4086585528509,"rank":3771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5999,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316,"mean":0.45285714285714,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
