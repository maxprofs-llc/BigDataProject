Using 17-day-old SkinEthic(\u00ae) reconstructed human epidermis, we investigated (at 34\u00b0C) the role of lemon EO in enhancing the penetration of \u03b1-tocopherol (E) and retinyl acetate (A), pyridoxine (B(6)) and ascorbic acid (C), released from O\/W or W\/O emulsions. D-limonene, \u03b1-pinene and p-cymene (65.9, 2.2 and 0.5%w\/w of the oil) had skin permeability coefficients Ps (10(-3) cm h(-1)) of 0.56 \u00b1 0.03 (or 0.73 \u00b1 0.02), 0.72 \u00b1 0.05 (or 0.98 \u00b1 0.05) and 0.84 \u00b1 0.04 (or 1.14 \u00b1 0.04), respectively, when incorporated in a W\/O (or O\/W) emulsion. Vitamins B6, C and A had Ps values of (3.0 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10(-3), (7.9 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10(-3) and (0.37 \u00b1 0.02) \u00d7 10(-5) cm h(-1), respectively, and their flux through the skin was enhanced by a factor of 4.1, 3.4 and 5.8, respectively, in the presence of lemon EO. The penetration of vitamin E was nine-fold enhanced. Lemon EO produced only reversible modification of TEWL, and it is a safe and effective penetration enhancer for topical administration of lipid- and water-soluble vitamins.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b38","authors":["Valgimigli L","Gabbanini S","Berlini E","Lucchi E","Beltramini C","Bertarelli YL"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1468-2494.2012.00725.x","endpage":"356","first_seen_on":"2012-04-29T07:16:52+00:00","issns":["0142-5463"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Cosmetic Science","last_mentioned_on":1484153675,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22515469","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22515469"],"pmid":"22515469","pubdate":"2012-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"347","subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Lemon (Citrus limon, Burm.f.) essential oil enhances the trans-epidermal release of lipid- (A, E) and water- (B(6) , C) soluble vitamins from topical emulsions in reconstructed human epidermis.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lemon-citrus-limon-burmf-essential-oil-enhances-transepidermal-release-lipid-e-water-b6-c-soluble-vi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.1,"score_history":{"1y":3.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8058252,"mean":6.8390091159945,"rank":1138423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6916990,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8058252,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94042,"mean":5.2903132250827,"rank":12694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":81307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94042,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":343,"mean":4.2379941520468,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":343,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.58333333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
