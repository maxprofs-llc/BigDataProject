Targeting IL-23\/Th17 pathway with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) has been successful in the reduction of skin and airway inflammation in animal models. However, the mAb has a short half-life, requiring repeated administrations. For the long-term suppression of IL-23\/Th17 pathway, we have previously developed an IL-23p40 peptide-based virus-like particle vaccine, which induces long-lasting autoantibodies to IL-23.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002545","authors":["Guan, Q.","Ma, Y.","Aboud, L.","Weiss, C.
