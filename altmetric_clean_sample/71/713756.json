Various risk factors, including vascular abnormalities, have been associated with this disease. Sleep-associated diseases, like sleep apnea syndrome, might also represent a risk factor. Sleep apnea syndrome is characterized by repetitive upper airway obstructions during sleep, inducing hypoxia and sleep disruption with the risk of cardiovascular and neurological sequelae. In this study, we determined the prevalence of sleep apnea syndrome in primary open-angle glaucoma patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f61000324f","authors":["Mojon, D S","Hess, C W","Goldblum, D","B\u00f6hnke, M","K\u00f6rner, F","Mathis, J"],"first_seen_on":"2012-04-25T14:37:50+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0030-3755"],"issue":"2","journal":"Ophthalmologica","last_mentioned_on":1337376145,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/10720914\/"],"pmid":"10720914","pubdate":"2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Primary open-angle glaucoma is associated with sleep apnea syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"214","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/primary-openangle-glaucoma-associated-sleep-apnea-syndrome-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230771,"mean":5.968061918834,"rank":973209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":5253897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230771,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81349,"mean":4.9553852829817,"rank":12495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":68796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81349,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173,"mean":1.1475697674419,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.3125,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":10}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1,"US":3,"EC":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/OFTALMOnoticias\/status\/195157199230738434","citation_ids":[713756],"posted_on":"2012-04-25T14:27:56+00:00","author":{"name":"OFTALMOnoticias","url":"http:\/\/oftalmonoticias.blogspot.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1850054803\/ojoverde_onn_normal.jpg","description":"Las \u00faltimas noticias del mundo de la Oftalmolog\u00eda #eyehealth","id_on_source":"OFTALMOnoticias","tweeter_id":"500650089","geo":{"lt":40,"ln":-4,"country":"ES"},"followers":4724},"tweet_id":"195157199230738434"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/AccessEyeCenter\/status\/202512490213548032","rt":["murphyod"],"citation_ids":[713756],"posted_on":"2012-05-15T21:35:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Access Eye Centers","url":"http:\/\/www.accesseye.com\/","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1328930608\/access.triangle_normal.png","description":"Our physicians understand how important your eyesight is and are committed to providing safe and effective eye care.
