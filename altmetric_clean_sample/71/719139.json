Deletion of CSP\u03b1 leads to neuronal dysfunction, synapse loss, and neurodegeneration. We utilized unbiased, systematic proteomics to identify putative CSP\u03b1 protein clients. We found 22 such proteins whose levels are selectively decreased in CSP\u03b1 knockout synapses. Of these putative CSP\u03b1 protein clients, two directly bind to the CSP\u03b1 chaperone complex and are bona fide clients. They are the t-SNARE SNAP-25 and the GTPase dynamin 1, which are necessary for synaptic vesicle fusion and fission, respectively. Using hippocampal cultures, we show that CSP\u03b1 regulates the stability of client proteins and synaptic vesicle number. Our analysis of CSP\u03b1-dynamin 1 interactions reveals unexpectedly that CSP\u03b1 regulates the polymerization of dynamin 1. CSP\u03b1, therefore, participates in synaptic vesicle endocytosis and may facilitate exo- and endocytic coupling. These findings advance the understanding of how synapses are functionally and structurally maintained.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319c","authors":["Zhang YQ","Henderson MX","Colangelo CM","Ginsberg SD","Bruce C","Wu T","Chandra SS"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuron.2012.01.029","first_seen_on":"2012-04-28T19:02:17+00:00","issns":["0896-6273"],"issue":"1","journal":"Neuron","last_mentioned_on":1335484800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22500636","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.neuron.2012.01.029"],"pmcid":"PMC3328141","pmid":"22500636","pubdate":"2012-04-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Identification of CSP\u03b1 Clients Reveals a Role in Dynamin 1 Regulation","type":"article","volume":"74","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-csp-clients-reveals-role-dynamin-1-regulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627649,"mean":4.9475528391989,"rank":2018221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":933060,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627649,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72833,"mean":4.1715048605008,"rank":32012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":27472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72833,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3775,"mean":10.089261791203,"rank":2370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3775,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":5.784375,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Ph.
