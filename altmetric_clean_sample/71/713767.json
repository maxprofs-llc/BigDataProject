Therefore, S1P levels need to be tightly controlled through the delicate interplay of its generating enzyme sphingosine kinase 1 and its functional antagonist S1P phosphohydrolase-1. The intracellular localization of S1P phosphohydrolase-1 necessitates the import of extracellular S1P into the intracellular compartment before its degradation. The present investigation proposes that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator transports extracellular S1P and hence modulates microvascular S1P signaling in health and disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057f2","doi":"10.1161\/circulationaha.111.047316","first_seen_on":"2012-04-25T14:42:43+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["1524-4539"],"journal":"Circulation","last_mentioned_on":1339027200,"links":["http:\/\/circ.ahajournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/04\/20\/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.047316.full.pdf?ijkey=eLQIEA5Lwr963eA&keytype=ref"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/circ.ahajournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/04\/20\/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.047316.full.pdf","pmid":"22534621","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"TNF\u03b1-Mediated Down-Regulation of CFTR Drives Pathological S1P Signaling in a Mouse Model of Heart Failure","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tumor-necrosis-factor%CE%B1mediated-downregulation-cystic-fibrosis-transmembrane-conductance-regulator-dr-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1989493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75582,"mean":4.5004768129556,"rank":26440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":46739,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75582,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6354,"mean":8.3374512828585,"rank":3519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":2700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6354,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":5.454375,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
