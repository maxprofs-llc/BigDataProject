Paper not open access. Modic changes review"],"citation":{"abstract":"Modic changes (MCs) have been identified as a diagnostic subgroup associated with low back pain (LBP). The aetiology of MCs is still unknown and there is no effective treatment available. If MCs constitute a specific subgroup of LBP, it seems reasonable to expect different effects from different treatments. The objective of this systematic critical literature review was therefore to investigate if there is evidence in the literature that the presence of MCs at baseline is associated with a favourable outcome depending on the treatment provided for LBP.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ca","authors":["Rikke K Jensen","Rikke K Jensen","Charlotte Leboeuf-Yde"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2474-12-183","first_seen_on":"2012-04-25T19:47:28+00:00","issns":["","1471-2474"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1368253881,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/12\/183"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/bmcmusculoskeletdisord\/content\/pdf\/1471-2474-12-183.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3162945","pmid":"21831312","pubdate":"2011-08-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"183","subjects":["orthopedics","physiology"],"title":"Is the presence of Modic changes associated with the outcomes of different treatments?
