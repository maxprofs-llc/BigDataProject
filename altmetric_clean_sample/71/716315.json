FAFEB J."],"citation":{"abstract":"Corneal epithelium relies on abundant glycogen stores as its primary energy source. MicroRNA-31 (miR-31), a corneal epithelial-preferred miRNA, negatively regulates factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (FIH-1). Since HIF-1\u03b1 is involved in anaerobic energy production, we investigated the role that miR-31 and FIH-1 play in regulating corneal epithelial glycogen. We used antagomirs (antago) to reduce the level of miR-31 in primary human corneal epithelial keratinocytes (HCEKs), and a miR-31-resistant FIH-1 to increase FIH-1 levels. Antago-31 raised FIH-1 levels and significantly reduced glycogen stores in HCEKs compared to irrelevant-antago treatment. Similarly, HCEKs retrovirally transduced with a miR-31-resistant FIH-1 had markedly reduced glycogen levels compared with empty vector controls. In addition, we observed no change in a HIF-1\u03b1 reporter or known genes downstream of HIF-1\u03b1 indicating that the action of FIH-1 and miR-31 on glycogen is HIF-1\u03b1-independent. An enzyme-dead FIH-1 mutation failed to restore glycogen stores, indicating that FIH-1 negatively regulates glycogen in a hydroxylase-independent manner. FIH-1 overexpression in HCEKs decreased AKT signaling, activated GSK-3\u03b2, and inactivated glycogen synthase. Treatment of FIH-1-transduced HCEKs with either a myristolated Akt or a GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor restored glycogen stores, confirming the direct involvement of Akt\/GSK-3\u03b2 signaling. Silencing FIH-1 in HCEKs reversed the observed changes in Akt-signaling. Glycogen regulation in a HIF-1\u03b1-independent manner is a novel function for FIH-1 and provides new insight into how the corneal epithelium regulates its energy requirements.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b3","doi":"10.1096\/fj.11-198515","first_seen_on":"2012-04-26T21:49:39+00:00","funders":["niams","nhlbi"],"issns":["1530-6860"],"journal":"FASEB Journal","last_mentioned_on":1338436556,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22532441?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22532441","pubdate":"2012-04-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","physiology"],"title":"MicroRNA-31 targets FIH-1 to positively regulate corneal epithelial glycogen metabolism.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna31-targets-fih1-positively-regulate-corneal-epithelial-glycogen-metabolism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4767223,"mean":5.7153615602584,"rank":2197848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2448588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4767223,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76640,"mean":4.7038880726522,"rank":27671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":46357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76640,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2220,"mean":8.3133068949977,"rank":1160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":999,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2220,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":4.404,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
