The common substrate for both anapleurosis and glucose phosphorylation in bacteria is the terminal glycolytic metabolite phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Here we show that Escherichia coli quickly and almost completely turns off PEP consumption upon glucose removal. The resulting buildup of PEP is used to quickly import glucose if it becomes available again. The switch-like termination of anapleurosis results from depletion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), an ultrasensitive allosteric activator of PEP carboxylase. E. coli expressing an FBP-insensitive point mutant of PEP carboxylase grow normally when glucose is steadily available. However, they fail to build up PEP upon glucose removal, grow poorly when glucose availability oscillates and suffer from futile cycling at the PEP node on gluconeogenic substrates. Thus, bacterial central carbon metabolism is intrinsically programmed with ultrasensitive allosteric regulation to enable rapid adaptation to changing environmental conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f610004264","authors":["Yi-Fan Xu","Daniel Amador-Noguez","Marshall Louis Reaves","Xiao-Jiang Feng","Joshua D Rabinowitz"],"doi":"10.1038\/nchembio.941","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2012-04-25T13:41:06+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1552-4450","1552-4469"],"journal":"Nature Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1335361191,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nchembio\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/nchembio.941.html"],"pmid":"22522319","pubdate":"2012-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"","subjects":["chemistry","biology"],"title":"Ultrasensitive regulation of anapleurosis via allosteric activation of PEP carboxylase","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultrasensitive-regulation-anapleurosis-via-allosteric-activation-pep-carboxylase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":2940930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1424728,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75581,"mean":4.457838290553,"rank":43969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":28678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75581,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1219,"mean":10.669045977011,"rank":1059,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1219,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":4.9678048780488,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Ph.
