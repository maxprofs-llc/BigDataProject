The two isoforms are found in similar amounts in most tissues, but we observed an unexpected pattern of expression in the brain. Western blot and immunohistochemistry studies showed that lamin C is abundant in the mouse brain, whereas lamin A and its precursor prelamin A are restricted to endothelial cells and meningeal cells and are absent in neurons and glia. Prelamin A transcript levels were low in the brain, but this finding could not be explained by alternative splicing. In lamin A-only knockin mice, where alternative splicing is absent and all the output of the gene is channeled into prelamin A transcripts, large amounts of lamin A were found in peripheral tissues, but there was very little lamin A in the brain. Also, in knockin mice expressing exclusively progerin (a toxic form of prelamin A found in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome), the levels of progerin in the brain were extremely low. Further studies showed that prelamin A expression, but not lamin C expression, is down-regulated by a brain-specific microRNA, miR-9. Expression of miR-9 in cultured cells reduced lamin A expression, and this effect was abolished when the miR-9-binding site in the prelamin A 3' UTR was mutated. The down-regulation of prelamin A expression in the brain could explain why mouse models of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome are free of central nervous system pathology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PNAS..109E.423J","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Jung HJ","Coffinier C","Choe Y","Beigneux AP","Davies BS","Yang SH","Barnes RH 2nd","Hong J","Sun T","Pleasure SJ","Young SG","Fong LG"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1111780109","endpage":"E431","first_seen_on":"2012-04-24T03:37:59+00:00","funders":["nci","nhlbi"],"issns":["0027-8424","1091-6490"],"issue":"7","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1336521600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22308344?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.1111780109"],"pmid":"22308344","pubdate":"2012-02-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"E423","subjects":["science"],"title":"Regulation of prelamin A but not lamin C by miR-9, a brain-specific microRNA","type":"article","volume":"109","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regulation-prelamin-not-lamin-c-mir9-brainspecific-microrna"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":1990145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2420759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75454,"mean":4.4675164141916,"rank":26253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":46858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75454,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37411,"mean":15.259931248329,"rank":24157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":12641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37411,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":793,"mean":14.646295454545,"rank":470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":793,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Ph.
