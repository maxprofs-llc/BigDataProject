The high and low trait anxiety groups were selected by using Spielberger's Trait Anxiety Scale, with trait anxiety scores, and control and pressure conditions manipulated by instructions. The participants were two groups of eight university male soccer players. They individually performed 20 shots from the penalty shoot-out point, aiming at the top right and top left corner areas in the soccer goal. Each condition had 10 trials in a within-subject design. The dependent measures comprised the number of successful goals and the state anxiety scores under each instructional condition. The result showed a significant main effect of instruction. State anxiety scores increased more and the number of successful goals decreased more in high trait anxiety groups than in low trait anxiety groups under pressure instructional condition. These findings suggest that players with higher trait anxiety scores tend to experience increased state anxiety under a pressure-laden condition, and higher state anxiety interferes with goal performance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E5727H","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Masami Horikawa","Akihiro Yagi"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0035727","first_seen_on":"2012-04-23T20:59:34+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1418257372,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035727?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3335041\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0035727.pdf","pmid":"22539998","pubdate":"2012-04-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e35727","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"The Relationships among Trait Anxiety, State Anxiety and the Goal Performance of Penalty Shoot-Out by University Soccer Players","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationships-among-trait-anxiety-state-anxiety-goal-performance-penalty-shootout-university-soccer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7659283,"mean":6.5811145329243,"rank":1552820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6095000,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7659283,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91777,"mean":5.0614850069735,"rank":17272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":74306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91777,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108963,"mean":10.22714851049,"rank":29248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":79402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108963,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2958,"mean":7.9234616165032,"rank":718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":2232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2958,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
