Dire Messages Reduce Belief in Global Warming (2010) by Feinberg","Good paper suggesting people's belief in a just world means they don't engage with fear appraisals on climate change"],"citation":{"abstract":"Though scientific evidence for the existence of global warming continues to mount, in the United States and other countries belief in global warming has stagnated or even decreased in recent years. One possible explanation for this pattern is that information about the potentially dire consequences of global warming threatens deeply held beliefs that the world is just, orderly, and stable. Individuals overcome this threat by denying or discounting the existence of global warming, and this process ultimately results in decreased willingness to counteract climate change. Two experiments provide support for this explanation of the dynamics of belief in global warming, suggesting that less dire messaging could be more effective for promoting public understanding of climate-change research.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033de","authors":["Matthew Feinberg","Robb Willer","Feinberg M","Willer R"],"doi":"10.1177\/0956797610391911","endpage":"38","first_seen_on":"2012-04-23T16:26:33+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1467-9280","0956-7976"],"issue":"1","journal":"Psychological Science (Sage Publications Inc.)","last_mentioned_on":1493306940,"links":["http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/22\/1\/34.abstract","http:\/\/intl-pss.sagepub.com\/content\/22\/1\/34.full","http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2010\/12\/06\/0956797610391911.abstract","http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/22\/1\/34","http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2010\/12\/06\/0956797610391911.abstract?rss=1","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/0956797610391911","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21148457"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/22\/1\/34.full.pdf","pmid":"21148457","pubdate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"34","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Apocalypse Soon?
