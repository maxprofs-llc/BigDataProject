Only in Brazil, the estimate is for 18,430 new cases in 2011. Several types of molecular markers have been studied in carcinogenesis including proteins associated with apoptosis such as BAG-1 and PARP-1. This study aims to demonstrate the expression of BAG-1 and PARP-1 in patients with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) and invasive squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the uterine cervix and to verify a possible association with HPV infection. Fifty samples of LSILs, 50 samples of HSILs and 50 samples of invasive SCCs of the uterine cervix were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for BAG-1 and PARP-1 expression. PCR was performed to detect and type HPV DNA. BAG-1 expression levels were significantly different between LSILs and HSILs (p = 0,014) and between LSILs and SCCs (p = 0,014). In regards to PARP-1 expression, we found significant differences between the expression levels in HSILs and SCCs (p = 0,022). No association was found between BAG-1 expression and the presence of HPV. However, a significant association was found between PARP-1 expression and HPV positivity in the HSILs group (p = 0,021). In conclusion our research suggests that BAG-1 expression could contribute to the differentiation between LSIL and HSIL\/SCC whereas PARP-1 could be useful to the differentiation between HSIL HPV-related and SCC. Further studies are needed to clarify the molecular aspects of the relationship between PARP-1 expression and HPV infection, with potential applications for cervical cancer prediction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f61000846e","authors":["Hassumi-Fukasawa, Marcela Kazue","Miranda-Camargo, Fabiana Alves","Zanetti, Bruna Riedo","Galano, Denise Faria","Ribeiro-Silva, Alfredo","Soares, Edson Garcia"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12253-012-9523-y","first_seen_on":"2012-04-29T17:24:48+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1532-2807"],"issue":"4","journal":"Pathology & Oncology Research","last_mentioned_on":1335719705,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22454210?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22454210","pubdate":"2012-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","pathology"],"title":"Expression of BAG-1 and PARP-1 in Precursor Lesions and Invasive Cervical Cancer Associated with Human Papillomavirus (HPV).","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-bag1-parp1-precursor-lesions-invasive-cervical-cancer-associated-human-papillomavirus-hpv-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630679,"mean":4.9289340563991,"rank":2899311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":79784,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630679,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72890,"mean":4.1676790736599,"rank":52463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72890,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":1.2373913043478,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.8125,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/pristinepeak\/status\/196648813895753729","citation_ids":[719959],"posted_on":"2012-04-29T17:15:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Pristine Peak","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1203819152\/miniature-rose-1_normal.jpg","description":"Radoncologist by profession.
