In the present study non-cytotoxic dose of oxidants, H2O2 (100\u00a0\u03bcM) and GO (10\u00a0\u03bcU\/ml) was used to induce moderate oxidative stress via generating ROS in human glioblastoma cell line U-87 MG cells, which showed a marked increase in the antioxidant capacity as studied by measuring the modulation in expression levels and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD1 and SOD2) and catalase (CAT) enzymes, and the GSH content. However, pretreatment (3\u00a0h) of Curcumin and Quercetin (10\u00a0\u03bcM) followed by the treatment of oxidants enhanced the cell survival, and the levels\/activities of the antioxidants studied. Oxidative stress also resulted in an increase in the nitrite levels in the culture supernatants, and further analysis by immunocytochemistry showed an increase in iNOS expression. In addition, phytochemical pretreatment decreased the nitrite level in the culture supernatants of oxidatively stressed U-87 MG cells. Elevated ROS also increased the expression of COX-2 and APE1 enzymes and pretreatment of Curcumin and Quercetin decreased COX-2 expression and increased APE1 expression in the oxidatively stressed U-87 MG cells. The immunocytochemistry also indicates for APE1 enhanced stress-dependent subcellular localization to the nuclear compartment, which advocates for enhanced DNA repair and redox functions of APE1 towards survival of U-87 MG cells. It can be concluded that intracellular oxidants activate the key enzymes involved in antioxidant mechanisms, NO-dependent survival mechanisms, and also in the DNA repair pathways for glial cell survival in oxidative-stress micro-environment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5033cf058f6100030b7","authors":["Cholia, Ravi P.","Kumari, Sanju","Kumar, Saurabh","Kaur, Manpreet","Kaur, Manbir","Kumar, Raj","Dhiman, Monisha","Mantha, Anil K."],"doi":"10.1007\/s11011-017-0057-6","first_seen_on":"2017-07-06T15:05:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0885-7490","1573-7365"],"journal":"Metabolic Brain Disease","last_mentioned_on":1499352755,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28676971?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28676971","pubdate":"2017-07-06T22:05:34+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","brain"],"title":"An in vitro study ascertaining the role of H2O2 and glucose oxidase in modulation of antioxidant potential and cancer cell survival mechanisms in glioblastoma U-87 MG cells","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170401,"mean":6.9145194585267,"rank":7070710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170401,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177529,"mean":11.581057703574,"rank":143974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177529,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":408,"mean":3.5446781326781,"rank":313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":408,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.595,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"PT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/braintumor_UL\/statuses\/882975568672706561","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21548921],"posted_on":"2017-07-06T14:52:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Brain tumor ULisboa","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/687579003163643904\/d5iTojK9_normal.jpg","description":"Follow for the latest updates on Brain tumors.
