Several gastric decompression systems exist to manage DGE. Patients with a pancreatic tumor require prolonged nutrition; however, controversies exist concerning nutrition protocol after PD. The aim of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of nasogastric (NG), gastrostomy (GT), and gastrojejunostomy (GJ) tubes with different feeding systems on postoperative courses.\nBetween January 2013 and March 2016, 86 patients underwent PD with pancreaticogastrostomy. Patients were divided into three groups: GJ group with enteral nutrition (EN, n\u00a0=\u00a012, 14%), NG (n\u00a0=\u00a031, 36%) and GT groups (n\u00a0=\u00a043, 50%), both with total parenteral nutrition (TPN).\nPatients in the GJ (n\u00a0=\u00a09, 75%) and GT (n\u00a0=\u00a018, 42%) groups had an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 3 more often than those in the NG group (n\u00a0=\u00a05, 16%, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01). Multivariate analysis identified the GT tube with TPN as an independent risk factor of severe morbidity (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and DGE (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). An ASA score of 3, jaundice, common pancreatic duct size \u22643\u00a0mm and soft pancreatic gland texture (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were found as independent risk factors of PSCs. Use of a GJ tube with EN, GT tube with TPN, jaundice, and PSCs were identified as independent risk factors for greater postoperative length of hospital stay (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Mean global hospitalization cost did not differ between groups.\nGT tube insertion with TPN was associated with increased severe postoperative morbidity and DGE and should not be recommended. EN through a GJ tube after PD is feasible but does not have clear advantages on postoperative courses compared to an NG tube.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000087d","authors":["Guilbaud, Th\u00e9ophile","Birnbaum, David J\u00e9r\u00e9mie","Loubi\u00e8re, Sandrine","Bonnet, Julien","Chopinet, Sophie","Gr\u00e9goire, Emilie","Berdah, St\u00e9phane","Hardwigsen, Jean","Moutardier, Vincent","Th\u00e9ophile Guilbaud","David J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Birnbaum","Sandrine Loubi\u00e8re","Julien Bonnet","Sophie Chopinet","Emilie Gr\u00e9goire","St\u00e9phane Berdah","Jean Hardwigsen","Vincent Moutardier"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12937-017-0265-2","first_seen_on":"2017-07-06T10:10:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1475-2891"],"issue":"1","journal":"Nutrition Journal","last_mentioned_on":1499422329,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28676052?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28676052","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Comparison of different feeding regimes after pancreatoduodenectomy - a retrospective cohort analysis","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-different-feeding-regimes-after-pancreatoduodenectomy-retrospective-cohort-analysis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172783,"mean":6.915960179526,"rank":7072731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172783,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178396,"mean":11.605828739595,"rank":144655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178396,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":897,"mean":24.942198660714,"rank":854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":897,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":7.1830769230769,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/libroazuln\/statuses\/882904472686546946","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21542981],"posted_on":"2017-07-06T10:10:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":159},"tweet_id":"882904472686546946"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/libroazuln\/statuses\/883267382721916929","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21542981],"posted_on":"2017-07-07T10:12:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":159},"tweet_id":"883267382721916929"}]}}
