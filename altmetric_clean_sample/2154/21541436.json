For atomic and molecular glasses, a wide range of fragilities have been observed; in colloidal systems these effects can be emulated by adjusting the particle softness. The colloidal glass transition can range from a super-exponential, fragile, increase in viscosity with increasing density for hard spheres to a strong, Arrhenius-like, transition for compressible particles. However, the microscopic origin of fragility and strength remain elusive, both in the colloidal and the atomic domain. Here, we propose a simple model that explains fragility changes in colloidal glasses by describing the volume regulation of compressible colloids in order to maintain osmotic equilibrium. Our simple model not only provides a microscopic explanation for fragility, but we show that it can describe experimental data for a variety of soft colloidal systems, ranging from microgels to star polymers and proteins. Our results highlight that the elastic energy per particle acts as an effective fragility order parameter, leading to a universal description of the colloidal glass transition.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Pieter van der Scheer","Ties van de Laar","Jasper van der Gucht","Dimitris Vlassopoulos","Joris Sprakel"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsnano.7b01359","first_seen_on":"2017-07-06T08:28:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1936-0851","1936-086X"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1499324353,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1021\/acsnano.7b01359"],"pmid":"28658568","pubdate":"2017-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Fragility and Strength in Nanoparticle Glasses","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fragility-strength-nanoparticle-glasses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170401,"mean":6.9145194585267,"rank":1172855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6923213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170401,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177528,"mean":11.581236724555,"rank":35134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":141286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177528,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4981,"mean":11.952748594378,"rank":1618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":3287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4981,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":20.976863636364,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
