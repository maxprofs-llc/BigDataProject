Photodegradation of a drug can considerably modify its pharmacokinetic behavior by varying the therapeutic index. The evaluation of the degradation profile of a drug, according to the ICH rules, is of primary importance in developing an appropriate topical formulation. Advanced strategies have been proposed to increase the protection from the light of the photolabile drugs. Supramolecular systems have been investigated to improve both pharmacokinetic profile and photostability. In this review, the more recent stability-monitoring methods for the analysis of drugs in topical formulations are collected and the main approaches for the drug photostabilization are discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074e0","authors":["Giuseppina Ioele","Lorena Tavano","Michele De Luca","Rita Muzzalupo","Annalisa Mancuso","Gaetano Ragno"],"doi":"10.4155\/fmc-2017-0105","first_seen_on":"2017-09-29T11:06:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1756-8919","1756-8927"],"journal":"Future Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1506683160,"links":["https:\/\/www.future-science.com\/doi\/full\/10.4155\/fmc-2017-0105"],"pmid":"28925725","publisher":" Future Science Ltd London, UK ","subjects":["chemistry","pharmacy"],"title":"Light-sensitive drugs in topical formulations: stability indicating methods and photostabilization strategies","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0.5,"6d":0.5,"5d":0.5,"4d":0.5,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":6420798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1150617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111393,"mean":11.430623725223,"rank":77965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":20939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111393,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":529,"mean":3.492303030303,"rank":307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":529,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.1875,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/fsgfmc\/statuses\/913721518013612033","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26743400],"posted_on":"2017-09-29T11:06:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Future Med Chem Jnl","url":"http:\/\/www.future-science.com\/loi\/fmc","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/494052734157348866\/i1hYgJ_Z_normal.jpeg","description":"Future Medicinal Chemistry | MEDLINE-indexed journal on small-molecule bioactive agents and therapeutic targets | IF 3.556 | Published by Future Science Group","id_on_source":"fsgfmc","tweeter_id":"2689572067","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":820},"tweet_id":"913721518013612033"}]}}
