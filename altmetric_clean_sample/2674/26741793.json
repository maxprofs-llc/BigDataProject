To gain an understanding of the dynamics of cell cycle regulation during vemurafenib therapy, we analyzed several vemurafenib-resistant human melanoma sublines derived from BRAF(V600E) harboring vemurafenib-sensitive parental lines. Vemurafenib provoked G0\/G1 phase arrest in parental but not in vemurafenib-resistant sublines. We hypothesized that refractoriness of vemurafenib-resistant sublines to vemurafenib-mediated cell cycle inhibition can be partially rescued by the chromatin modifier suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid promoted G2\/M arrest at expense of S phase irrespective of vemurafenib sensitivity. In parental lines, combination of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and vemurafenib induced both G0\/G1 arrest and apoptosis, whereas in vemurafenib-resistant sublines combination induced G0\/G1 as well as G2\/M arrest resulting in dramatic cytostasis. Vemurafenib-resistant sublines exhibited extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 but not AKT and hyperphosphorylation. Gene expression profiling revealed mitogen-activated protein kinase hyperactivation and deregulations of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases in vemurafenib-resistant sublines, all of which were reversed by suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid; changes that may explain the cytostatic effects of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid. These results suggest that unresponsiveness of vemurafenib-resistant sublines to the biological effects of vemurafenib may be amenable by suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid. These in vitro results, while require further investigation, may provide rational biological basis for combination therapy in the management of vemurafenib-resistant melanoma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c15","authors":["Antoni X Toress-Collado","Ramin Nazarian","Ali R Jazirehi"],"doi":"10.1177\/1010428317721620","first_seen_on":"2017-09-29T10:51:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1010-4283","1423-0380"],"issue":"9","journal":"Tumor Biology","last_mentioned_on":1506682358,"links":["http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/1010428317721620#articleShareContainer","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/1010428317721620#.Wc4lu1ectp0.linkedin"],"pmid":"28936920","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE PublicationsSage UK: London, England","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Rescue of cell cycle progression in BRAFV600E inhibitor\u2013resistant human melanoma by a chromatin modifier","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rescue-cell-cycle-progression-brafv600e-inhibitorresistant-human-melanoma-chromatin-modifier"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":1,"6d":1,"5d":1,"4d":1,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":4523116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2357857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111392,"mean":11.430706592095,"rank":59373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":40310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111392,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1985,"mean":1.279158266129,"rank":418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":1318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1985,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cienciaesfacil\/statuses\/913717872035287040","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26741793],"posted_on":"2017-09-29T10:51:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Antoni Torres","url":"http:\/\/lacienciaesfacil.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/573079273491177472\/avOhGbmM_normal.png","description":"Asesor cient\u00edfico y divulgador.","id_on_source":"cienciaesfacil","tweeter_id":"2818890495","geo":{"lt":41.38879,"ln":2.15899,"country":"ES"},"followers":397},"tweet_id":"913717872035287040"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cienciaesfacil\/statuses\/913718155121496064","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26741793],"posted_on":"2017-09-29T10:52:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Antoni Torres","url":"http:\/\/lacienciaesfacil.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/573079273491177472\/avOhGbmM_normal.png","description":"Asesor cient\u00edfico y divulgador.","id_on_source":"cienciaesfacil","tweeter_id":"2818890495","geo":{"lt":41.38879,"ln":2.15899,"country":"ES"},"followers":397},"tweet_id":"913718155121496064"}]}}
