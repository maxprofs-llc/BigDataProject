There is growing recognition that the inflammation in COPD is not only confined to the lungs but also involves the systemic circulation and can impact nonpulmonary organs, including blood vessels. \u03b11-antitrypsin-low-density lipoprotein (AT-LDL) complex is an oxidatively modified LDL that accelerates atherosclerosis. Curcumin, one of the best-investigated natural products, is a powerful antioxidant. However, the effects of curcumin on AT-LDL remain unknown. We hypothesized that Theracurmin(\u00ae), a highly absorptive curcumin with improved bioavailability using a drug delivery system, ameliorates the inflammatory status in subjects with mild COPD.\nThis is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. Subjects with stages I-II COPD according to the Japanese Respiratory Society criteria were randomly assigned to receive 90 mg Theracurmin(\u00ae) or placebo twice a day for 24 weeks, and changes in inflammatory parameters were evaluated.\nThere were no differences between the Theracurmin(\u00ae) and placebo groups in terms of age, male\/female ratio, or body mass index in 39 evaluable subjects. The percent changes in blood pressure and hemoglobin A1c and LDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, or high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels after treatment were similar for the two groups. However, the percent change in the AT-LDL level was significantly (P=0.020) lower in the Theracurmin(\u00ae) group compared with the placebo group.\nTheracurmin(\u00ae) reduced levels of atherosclerotic AT-LDL, which may lead to the prevention of future cardiovascular events in mild COPD subjects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f61000784b","authors":["Tatsuya Morimoto","Masafumi Funamoto","Hiromichi Wada","Koji Hasegawa","Yoichi Sunagawa","Yasufumi Katanasaka","Yusuke Miyazaki","Atsushi Imaizumi","Hideaki Kakeya","Hajime Yamakage","Noriko Satoh-Asahara","Maki Komiyama"],"doi":"10.2147\/copd.s104490","endpage":"2034","first_seen_on":"2016-08-29T03:47:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-2005"],"journal":"International Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","last_mentioned_on":1502273917,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/highly-absorptive-curcumin-reduces-serum-atherosclerotic-low-density-l-peer-reviewed-article-COPD","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5008445\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27616885","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27616885?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=32104","pmid":"27616885","pubdate":"2016-08-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2029","subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Highly absorptive curcumin reduces serum atherosclerotic low-density lipoprotein levels in patients with mild COPD","type":"article","volume":"Volume 11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highly-absorptive-curcumin-reduces-serum-atherosclerotic-lowdensity-lipoprotein-levels-patients-mild"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8348788,"mean":7.0413328717018,"rank":3407344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4882172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8348788,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252766,"mean":12.468125484145,"rank":94309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":156344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252766,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1070,"mean":4.3040486435921,"rank":399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1070,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":3.2963917525773,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"TR":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DoveAllergy\/statuses\/770105583945019392","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10882381],"posted_on":"2016-08-29T03:47:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Dove Press Allergy","url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/browse_journals.php?pa=view&cat_id=2","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/294765612\/DoveLogoBlock-75_normal.jpg","description":"Latest Allergy and Respiratory Disease articles published in Dove Press open access medical and scientific journals","id_on_source":"DoveAllergy","tweeter_id":"53259835","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":12},"tweet_id":"770105583945019392"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DRMEHMETTATLI\/statuses\/770398838142210048","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10882381],"posted_on":"2016-08-29T23:12:50+00:00","author":{"name":"MEHMET TATLI","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/586238181458239488\/RTEMq0vG_normal.jpg","description":"Emergency Specialist in Turkey.
