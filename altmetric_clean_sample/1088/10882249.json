Physicochemical properties, including the morphology, particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency (EE%), pH, drug loading, and in vitro release, were determined. Preservation stability and pharmacokinetic studies were performed to compare the membrane-coated liposomes with either commercially available liposomes or the VS solution.\nThe sphere-like morphology of the vesicles was confirmed by transmission electron microscope. Increased particle size, especially for the chitosan formulation, was observed after the coating process. However, the EE% was ~99.0% with drug loading at 2.0 mg\/mL, which did not change after the coating process. The coating of long-circulation materials, except for chitosan, resulted in negatively charged and stable vesicles at physiological pH. The near-zero zeta potential exhibited by the PEG-DSPE formulation leads to a longer circulation lifetime and improved absorption for VS, when compared with the PEG-PLGA formulation. Compared with the commercial product, PEG was responsible for a higher plasma VS concentration and a longer half-life.\nPEG-DSPE coating may be related to better absorption, based on the stability and a pharmacokinetic improvement in the blood circulation time.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007966","authors":["Xiang Li","Jing Zhang","Yingchong Chen","Xinli Liang","Xiaojian Luo"],"doi":"10.2147\/ijn.s109547","first_seen_on":"2016-08-29T03:22:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-2013"],"journal":"International Journal of Nanomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1472441718,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/the-influence-of-different-long-circulating-materials-on-the-pharmacok-peer-reviewed-article-IJN"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=32102","pmid":"27616886","pubdate":"2016-08-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"The influence of different long-circulating materials on the pharmacokinetics of liposomal vincristine sulfate","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-different-longcirculating-materials-pharmacokinetics-liposomal-vincristine-sulfate"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":4415373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2309399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252309,"mean":12.463985906114,"rank":139107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":88058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252309,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1813,"mean":2.5665187637969,"rank":1009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1813,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":2.0602941176471,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DoveMedicalTech\/statuses\/770099176021581824","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10882249],"posted_on":"2016-08-29T03:22:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Dove Press Medical","url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/browse_journals.php?pa=view&cat_id=15","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/294800608\/DoveLogoBlock-75_normal.jpg","description":"Latest articles covering medical technology, from the role of nanotechnology to the latest implants, published in Dove Press open access journals.","id_on_source":"DoveMedicalTech","tweeter_id":"53265961","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":19},"tweet_id":"770099176021581824"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DoveImaging\/statuses\/770102500351442944","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10882249],"posted_on":"2016-08-29T03:35:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Dove Press Imaging","url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/browse_journals.php?pa=view&cat_id=13","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/294797475\/DoveLogoBlock-75_normal.jpg","description":"Latest articles covering medical and scientific aspects of imaging, from nanomedicine to clinical radiology, published in Dove Press open access journals","id_on_source":"DoveImaging","tweeter_id":"53265291","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":6},"tweet_id":"770102500351442944"}]}}
