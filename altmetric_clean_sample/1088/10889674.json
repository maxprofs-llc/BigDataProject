In order to determine the full load-velocity and load-perceived exertion relationships, 290 young, resistance-trained athletes (209 male and 81 female) performed a progressive strength test up to the one-repetition maximum. Longitudinal regression models were used to predict the relative load from the average velocity and the OMNI-RES 0-10 scale, considering sets as the time-related variable. Two adjusted predictive equations were developed from the association between the relative load and the average velocity or the perceived exertion expressed after performing several sets of 1 to 3 repetitions during the progressive test. The resulting two models were capable of estimating the relative load with an accuracy of 79% and 86% for the average velocity [Relative load (% 1RM) = 120.15 - 83.54 (AV)] and the exertion [Relative load (% 1RM) = 5.07 + 9.63 (RPE)] respectively. The strong association between relative load with average velocity and the perceived exertion support the use of both predictive variables to estimate strength performance in parallel squat.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040e2","authors":["Fernando Naclerio","Eneko Larumbe-Zabala","Naclerio, Fernando","Larumbe-Zabala, Eneko"],"doi":"10.1519\/jsc.0000000000001601","first_seen_on":"2016-08-29T13:08:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1533-4287","1064-8011"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research","last_mentioned_on":1495916267,"links":["https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/306349159_Relative_Load_Prediction_By_Velocity_And_The_Omni-Res_0-10_Scale_In_Parallel_Squat","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Abstract\/2017\/06000\/Relative_Load_Prediction_by_Velocity_and_the.17.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/2017\/06000\/Relative_Load_Prediction_by_Velocity_and_the.17.pdf","pmid":"27548793","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Relative Load Prediction By Velocity And The Omni-Res 0-10 Scale In Parallel Squat","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Fulltext\/2017\/06000\/Relative_Load_Prediction_by_Velocity_and_the.17.aspx","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relative-load-prediction-velocity-omnires-010-scale-parallel-squat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.45,"score_history":{"1y":4.45,"6m":3.45,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":1746410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6523554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251996,"mean":12.465377773368,"rank":69790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":181791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251996,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3868,"mean":16.247123868632,"rank":2200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3868,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":11.906378378378,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
