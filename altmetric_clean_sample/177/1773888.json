Most patients were diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome (51.9%) and low back pain (33.3%). The majority were White (72.5%), male (60%), married (72%), and temporary disabled or receiving worker's compensation (40%). Study objectives were tested with correlational and univariate analysis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057eb","authors":["Lekeisha Sumner","Kenneth Lofland","Sumner L","Lofland K"],"doi":"10.1177\/1742395313504233","first_seen_on":"2013-09-22T20:11:32+00:00","issns":["1745-9206","1742-3953"],"journal":"Chronic Illness","last_mentioned_on":1455016334,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24048947?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24048947","pubdate":"2013-09-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"SPINAL CORD STIMULATION: SUBJECTIVE PAIN INTENSITY AND PRESURGICAL CORRELATES IN CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spinal-cord-stimulation-subjective-pain-intensity-presurgical-correlates-chronic-pain-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7156405,"mean":6.3086437613049,"rank":5378506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":992632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7156405,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134089,"mean":6.9621852514768,"rank":84791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":25723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134089,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":4.3230508474576,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
