The advantages of the production of hybrid materials, metal-organic framework (MOF) adsorbents, expected for the biogas upgrading, rely on the bulk separation of CO2 under near-ambient conditions. This review highlights the challenges for MOF adsorbents, which have the greatest upgrading abilities for biogas via selective passage of methane. The key factors improving the ideal MOF materials for these high CO2 capture and selectivity uses for biogas upgrading to produce bio-methane and reduce fossil-fuel CO2 emission will be discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ee","authors":["Somboon Chaemchuen","Nawsad Alam Kabir","Kui Zhou","Francis Verpoort"],"doi":"10.1039\/c3cs60244c","first_seen_on":"2013-09-21T07:24:23+00:00","issns":["1460-4744","0306-0012"],"issue":"24","journal":"Chemical Society Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1379748151,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/CS\/C3CS60244C"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2013\/cs\/c3cs60244c","pmid":"24045837","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"9304","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Metal\u00e2\u0080\u0093organic frameworks for upgrading biogas via CO2 adsorption to biogas green energy","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metalorganic-frameworks-upgrading-biogas-via-co2-adsorption-biogas-green-energy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630432,"mean":4.9299514944696,"rank":2015635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":941892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630432,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92234,"mean":7.6250359849514,"rank":47978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":24551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92234,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":801,"mean":2.457335,"rank":409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":801,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.22,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":23,"Student  > Ph.
