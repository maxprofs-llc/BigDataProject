A literature review was conducted to reveal its strengths, the causes of its decline and future perspectives, the evidence with regard to learning clinical skills and patient\/student\/teacher satisfaction. PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library were systematically searched with regard to terms related to bedside teaching. Articles regarding the above-mentioned subjects were included. Bedside teaching has shown to improve certain clinical diagnostic skills in medical students and residents. Patients, students\/residents and teachers all seem to favour bedside teaching, for varying reasons. Despite this, the practice of bedside teaching is declining. Reasons to explain this decline include the increased patient turnover in hospitals, the assumed violation of patients' privacy and an increased reliance on technology in the diagnostic process. Solutions vary from increasingly using residents and interns as bedside teachers to actively educating staff members regarding the importance of bedside teaching and providing them with practical essentials. Impediments to bedside teaching need to be overcome if this teaching modality is to remain a valuable educational method for durable clinical skills.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81d3cf058f61000bbaa","authors":["Max Peters","Olle Ten Cate","Peters M","Ten Cate O"],"doi":"10.1007\/s40037-013-0083-y","first_seen_on":"2013-09-23T11:10:36+00:00","issns":["2212-2761","2212-277X"],"journal":"Perspectives on Medical Education","last_mentioned_on":1450692012,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24049043","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s40037-013-0083-y","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s40037-013-0083-y\/fulltext.html"],"pmid":"24049043","pubdate":"2013-09-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Bedside teaching in medical education: a literature review.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bedside-teaching-medical-education-literature-review-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6803403,"mean":6.1842532809271,"rank":1549365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5239277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6803403,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133017,"mean":6.9259412852592,"rank":32430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":100222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133017,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189,"mean":5.911085106383,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.35,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":7,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":15,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1,"Philosophy":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1,"JP":1},"mendeley":{"EC":1,"MY":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cambartley\/status\/382099841259544576","license":"public","rt":["BrianSMcGowan"],"citation_ids":[1775067],"posted_on":"2013-09-23T11:11:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Chris Bartley","url":"http:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/pub\/chris-bartley\/4\/38a\/424\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000196598698\/31cd4577ad7f5bc84eb745df2814e1ce_normal.jpeg","description":"MD and Chief Innovation Officer @HLMedicom, active author, LinkedIn group founder and consumer of content related to marketing, innovation and leadership","id_on_source":"cambartley","tweeter_id":"1625426689","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":5706},"tweet_id":"382099841259544576"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/grothuesmann\/statuses\/678451538667401216","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[1775067],"posted_on":"2015-12-20T05:47:06+00:00","author":{"name":"grothuesmann","url":"http:\/\/www.dg-maternalhealth.de","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/635988104969498624\/0mRsPFlG_normal.jpg","description":"Relaying on Standardized Training Modules I teach evidence-based obstetrical procedures and gynecology surgery in any requested setting","id_on_source":"grothuesmann","tweeter_id":"1201300628","geo":{"lt":40.71132,"ln":-73.70074,"country":"US"},"followers":65},"tweet_id":"678451538667401216"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cat_harumi\/statuses\/678877623162810369","license":"gnip","rt":["grothuesmann"],"citation_ids":[1775067],"posted_on":"2015-12-21T10:00:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Harumi","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/670929185397846016\/hkYU-xOJ_normal.jpg","description":"something beautiful .. #ArtLovers #photography yes, I'm a #CatLovers .. #PrayForPeace","id_on_source":"cat_harumi","tweeter_id":"3973147814","geo":{"lt":"35.0185804","ln":"135.763835","country":"JP"},"followers":813},"tweet_id":"678877623162810369"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BrianSMcGowan\/status\/382099601517707264","license":"public","citation_ids":[1775067],"posted_on":"2013-09-23T11:10:18+00:00","author":{"name":"How do you learn?","url":"http:\/\/www.archemedx.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/836926083630956545\/0ZjH1ksu_normal.jpg","description":"Co-Founder & CLO: @ArcheMedX.
