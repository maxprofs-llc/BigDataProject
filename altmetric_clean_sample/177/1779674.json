Unfortunately, for many living with this disease, HIV is associated with neuroinflammation, co-morbidities, and accelerated aging which can compromise brain function, resulting in cognitive deficits. The purpose of this article is to highlight how to interpret these deficits within the framework of neuroplasticity and cognitive reserve for this clinical population. We suggest several recommendations for cognitive rehabilitation and mitigation such as addressing lifestyle factors, psychostimulants, cognitive remediation therapy, and treatment of depression and anxiety. Implications for nursing research and practice are posited.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a65","authors":["Vance DE","Fazeli PL","Grant JS","Slater LZ","Raper JL"],"doi":"10.1097\/jnn.0b013e31829d8b29","first_seen_on":"2013-09-24T19:40:55+00:00","issns":["0888-0395"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of neuroscience nursing","last_mentioned_on":1391502871,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jnnonline\/Abstract\/2013\/10000\/The_Role_of_Neuroplasticity_and_Cognitive_Reserve.9.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24025470\/?i=29&from=HIV+rehabilitation"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jnnonline\/2013\/10000\/The_Role_of_Neuroplasticity_and_Cognitive_Reserve.9.pdf","pmid":"24025470","pubdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"306","subjects":["nursing","neurosurgery","neurology"],"title":"The Role of Neuroplasticity and Cognitive Reserve in Aging With HIV: Recommendations for Cognitive Protection and Rehabilitation","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-neuroplasticity-cognitive-reserve-aging-hiv"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505402,"mean":5.1012628106873,"rank":3043723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1346219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505402,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98157,"mean":7.7195161172013,"rank":69309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":27192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98157,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":426,"mean":1.2884705882353,"rank":342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":426,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.0208333333333,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
