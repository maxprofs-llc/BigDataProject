Here, the objective was to evaluate in mice whether consumption of MDMA during adolescence might influence the neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic effects of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a toxin known to induce PD in humans. The activation of astroglia and microglia by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and complement receptor type 3 (CD11b) immunohistochemistry and the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry were evaluated. MPTP (20 mg\/kg \u00d7 4) was administered to mice treated from ages 8 weeks to 17 weeks with MDMA (10 mg\/kg twice daily, two times a week). In mice that were chronically treated with MDMA, administration of MPTP induced a higher microglial and astroglial response in both the striatum and the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) compared with vehicle-treated or vehicle\u2009+\u2009MPTP-treated mice. Inflammatory changes were associated with a decrease in TH immunoreactivity in the SNc of MDMA-treated mice and with a further decrease in the striatum and the SNc of MDMA\u2009+\u2009MPTP-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated, MDMA-treated, and MPTP-treated mice. The results demonstrate that chronic administration of MDMA during late adolescence in mice exacerbates the neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation caused by MPTP, suggesting that MDMA may constitute a risk factor for dopaminergic neuron degeneration.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ecf","authors":["Costa, Giulia","Frau, Lucia","Wardas, Jadwiga","Pinna, Annalisa","Plumitallo, Antonio","Morelli, Micaela"],"doi":"10.1002\/mds.25646","endpage":"1965","first_seen_on":"2013-09-20T21:28:23+00:00","issns":["1531-8257","0885-3185"],"issue":"14","journal":"Movement Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1389127127,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mds.25646\/abstract;jsessionid=5D119115284793B6A5FE1DDA4E7B0826.d04t03?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+for+approximately+4+hours+between+09%3A00+EDT+and+14%3A00+EDT+on+Saturday%2C+28+September+2013+as+we+make+upgrades+to+improve+our+services+to+you.+There+will+also+be+some+delays+to+online+publishing+between+25+to+28+September+2013.+We+apologize+for+the+inconvenience+and+appreciate+your+patience.+Thank+you+for+using+Wiley+Online+Library%21","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fmds.25646","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mds.25646\/abstract;jsessionid=F053ECD727A8A302DC3B80838C268C78.f02t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mds.25646\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mds.25646\/abstract;jsessionid=D0FD9E67A9662E3D6A0A94A4DB2B05B9.f01t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mds.25646\/pdf","pmid":"24108425","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1957","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"MPTP\u00e2\u0080\u0090induced dopamine neuron degeneration and glia activation is potentiated in MDMA\u00e2\u0080\u0090pretreated mice","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mptpinduced-dopamine-neuron-degeneration-glia-activation-potentiated-mdmapretreated-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6512639,"mean":6.0321782558755,"rank":1236519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5268126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6512639,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111571,"mean":7.8526752173525,"rank":25859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":85497,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111571,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1829,"mean":5.1836881838074,"rank":410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":1413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1829,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.8352941176471,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
