No such studies have focused exclusively on Hindu physicians practicing in the United States. A 34-item questionnaire was sent to 293 Hindu physicians in the United States. Most participants believed that their religious beliefs do not influence their practice of medicine and do not interfere with withdrawal of life support. The US practice of discussing end-of-life issues with the patient, rather than primarily with the family, seems to have been adopted by Hindu physicians practicing in the United States. It is likely that the ethical, cultural, and patient-centered environment of US health care has influenced the practice of end-of-life care by Hindu physicians in this country.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005707","authors":["Vijaya Sivalingam Ramalingam","Fahad Saeed","Ramapriya Sinnakirouchenan","Jean L Holley","Sinnakirouchenan Srinivasan"],"doi":"10.1177\/1049909113505138","first_seen_on":"2013-09-23T16:01:18+00:00","issns":["1938-2715"],"journal":"American journal of hospice & palliative care","last_mentioned_on":1379952040,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24052431?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24052431","pubdate":"2013-09-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"End-of-Life Care Beliefs Among Hindu Physicians in the United States.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endoflife-care-beliefs-among-hindu-physicians-united-states"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3074669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":952581,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98198,"mean":7.7292846828317,"rank":67105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":20173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98198,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":557,"mean":2.0471115107914,"rank":320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":557,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":3.7342105263158,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
