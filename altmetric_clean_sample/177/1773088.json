There are few prospective, community studies of women reporting mood data from all phases of the menstrual cycle (MC). We aimed (i) to analyze daily mood data over 6 months for MC phase cyclicity and (ii) to compare MC phase influences on a woman's daily mood with that attributable to key alternate explanatory variables (physical health, perceived stress and social support).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033ed","authors":["Sarah E Romans","David Kreindler","Eriola Asllani","Gillian Einstein","Sheila Laredo","Anthony Levitt","Kathryn Morgan","Michele Petrovic","Brenda Toner","Donna E Stewart"],"doi":"10.1159\/000339370","first_seen_on":"2013-09-22T13:13:12+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["1423-0348"],"issue":"1","journal":"Psychotherapy & Psychosomatics","last_mentioned_on":1379851226,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23147261","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1159\/000339370"],"pmid":"23147261","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Mood and the Menstrual Cycle","type":"article","volume":"82","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mood-menstrual-cycle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4504771,"mean":5.0225959121568,"rank":2367264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1435252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4504771,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98143,"mean":7.482738684763,"rank":50510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":28114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98143,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314,"mean":7.9188051118211,"rank":217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":4.4733333333333,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
