The experiment includes treatments across different default choices and organ allocation rules inspired by the donor registration systems applied in different countries. Our results indicate that the opt-out with priority rule system generates the largest increase in organ donation relative to an opt-in only program. However, sizeable gains are achievable using either a priority rule or opt-out program separately, with the opt-out rule generating approximately 80% of the benefits achieved under a priority rule program.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd1","authors":["Danyang Li","Zackary Hawley","Kurt Schnier"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jhealeco.2013.09.007","first_seen_on":"2013-09-20T23:03:21+00:00","issns":["01676296"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Health Economics","last_mentioned_on":1432657661,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0167629613001264","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3855900\/"],"pmid":"24135615","pubdate":"2013-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservices","hospitals"],"title":"Increasing organ donation via changes in the default choice or allocation rule","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increasing-organ-donation-via-changes-default-choice-allocation-rule"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5148574,"mean":6.0866090235122,"rank":1202196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":3939197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5148574,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104007,"mean":7.8801428571429,"rank":27494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":76336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104007,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":614,"mean":8.1255856443719,"rank":277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":614,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":6.3794782608696,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
