Strain Ar-22(T) grew optimally at 35 \u00b0C, at pH 7.5 and in the presence of 1-3% (w\/v) NaCl. The isolate was positive for casein, gelatin and Tween 20 decomposition and negative for H2S production and indole formation. Chemotaxonomic analysis showed that MK-6 was the major isoprenoid quinone and phosphatidylethanolamine was the major polar lipid. The major fatty acids were iso-C(17:0) 3-OH, iso-C(15:1) G, iso-C(15:0) and C(16:1)\u03c97c\/iso-C(15:0) 2OH. The genomic DNA G+C content was 44.8 mol%. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain Ar-22(T) is closely related to members of the genus Muricauda, sharing 94.2-97.3% sequence similarity with the type strains of species of the genus Muricauda and being most closely related to the Muricauda aquimarina. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison confirmed that strain Ar-22(T) formed a deep lineage with Muricauda flavescens. Sequence similarity between strain Ar-22(T) and Muricauda ruestringensis DSM 13258(T), the type species of the genus Muricauda, was 96.9%. Strain Ar-22(T) exhibited mean DNA-DNA relatedness values of 40.1%, 49.4% and 25.7% to M. aquimarina JCM 11811(T), M. flavescens JCM 11812(T) and Muricauda lutimaris KCTC 22173(T), respectively. On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic data, strain Ar-22(T) represents a novel species of the genus Muricauda, for which the name Muricauda antarctica sp. nov. (type strain Ar-22(T)\u200a=CGMCC 1.12174(T)\u200a=\u200aJCM 18450(T)) is proposed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["Yue-Hong Wu","Pei-Song Yu","Ya-Dong Zhou","Lin Xu","Chun-Sheng Wang","Min Wu","Aharon Oren","Xue-Wei Xu","Wu YH","Yu PS","Zhou YD","Xu L","Wang CS","Wu M","Oren A","Xu XW"],"doi":"10.1099\/ijs.0.048355-0","endpage":"3456","first_seen_on":"2013-09-21T12:26:39+00:00","issns":["1466-5034","1466-5026"],"issue":"Pt 9","journal":"International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1469858180,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23543499"],"pmid":"23543499","pubdate":"2013-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Microbiology Society","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"3451","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Muricauda antarctica sp. nov., a marine member of the Flavobacteriaceae isolated from Antarctic seawater.","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/muricauda-antarctica-sp-nov-marine-member-flavobacteriaceae-isolated-antarctic-seawater"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8156965,"mean":6.8933631772734,"rank":1912167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6207780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8156965,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138084,"mean":7.1540872953226,"rank":32987,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":104348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138084,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3680,"mean":2.7950209296004,"rank":298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":3339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3680,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":3.066,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
