The vast majority of PCas are hormonally driven diseases in which androgen signalling plays a central role. The realization that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) continues to rely on androgen signalling prompted the development of new, effective androgen blocking agents. As the understanding of the molecular biology of PCas evolves, it is hoped that stratification of prostate tumours into distinct molecular entities, each with its own set of vulnerabilities, will be a feasible goal. Around half of PCas harbour rearrangements involving a member of the ETS transcription factor family. Tumours without this rearrangement include SPOP mutant as well as SPINK1-over-expressing subtypes. As the number of targeted therapy agents increases, it is crucial to determine which patients will benefit from these interventions and molecular pathology will be key in this respect. In addition to directly targeting cells, therapies that modify the tumour microenvironment have also been successful in prolonging the lives of PCa patients. Understanding the molecular aspects of PCa therapeutics will allow pathologists to provide core recommendations for patient management.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dc7","authors":["Rodrigues, Daniel Nava","Butler, Lisa M","Estelles, David Lorente","de Bono, Johann S.","de Bono, Johann S","Daniel Nava Rodrigues","Lisa M Butler","David Lorente Estelles","Johann S de Bono"],"doi":"10.1002\/path.4272","endpage":"184","first_seen_on":"2013-09-24T08:10:36+00:00","funders":["dohuk","cruk"],"handle":"2440\/89684","handles":["2440\/89684"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1096-9896","0022-3417","00223417"],"issue":"2","journal":"The Journal of Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1391948788,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/path.4272\/abstract;jsessionid=57960D72579BBA2FC9B31B8467E8EE97.d02t04?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+for+approximately+4+hours+between+09%3A00+EDT+and+14%3A00+EDT+on+Saturday%2C+28+September+2013+as+we+make+upgrades+to+improve+our+services+to+you.+There+will+also+be+some+delays+to+online+publishing+between+25+to+28+September+2013.+We+apologize+for+the+inconvenience+and+appreciate+your+patience.+Thank+you+for+using+Wiley+Online+Library%21","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/path.4272\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fpath.4272","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/path.4272\/full","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/path.4272"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/path.4272\/pdf","pmid":"24108540","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"178","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Molecular Pathology and Prostate Cancer Therapeutics: From Biology to Bedside","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/path.4272","volume":"232","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-pathology-prostate-cancer-therapeutics-biology-bedside"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6690771,"mean":6.1588891078284,"rank":2692913,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":3930725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6690771,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132342,"mean":6.9654899690952,"rank":46678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":83985,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132342,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1017,"mean":3.3543208661417,"rank":493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":497,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1017,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":4.1482857142857,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
