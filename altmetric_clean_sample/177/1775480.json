The safety and efficacy of this diagnostic tool has stood the test of time and is still the gold standard for the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). Since its discovery, much effort has been put into standardization and optimization of allergens, vehicles, and concentrations of patch-test materials; in procedures of its application; and in reading and scoring of test reactions--all contributing to the development of an accurate, reliable, and safe test with a high reproducibility of its results. Even this seemingly carved-in-stone practice, which has been used for nearly 120 years, has been questioned and challenged, engendering debates, disagreements, and controversies, which show no signs of coming to an end. Almost every step of the procedure has provoked discussions and controversies:","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002580","authors":["Wolf, Ronni","Orion, Edith","Ruocco, Vincenzo","Baroni, Adone","Ruocco, Eleonora"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.clindermatol.2013.01.015","first_seen_on":"2013-09-23T14:18:08+00:00","issns":["0738-081X"],"journal":"Clinics in Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1379362709,"links":["http:\/\/www.cidjournal.com\/article\/S0738-081X(13)00016-3\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cidjournal.com\/article\/S0738-081X(13)00016-3\/pdf","pmid":"23806165","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Patch testing: Facts and controversies","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/patch-testing-facts-controversies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229091,"mean":5.9655632456766,"rank":4606601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229091,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109062,"mean":7.9309049614437,"rank":72928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":19302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109062,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":380,"mean":3.2666754617414,"rank":248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":380,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":4.55,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":5,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":14,"Chemistry":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"TW":1,"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/panoramaderm\/status\/379700841462382592","license":"public","citation_ids":[1775480],"posted_on":"2013-09-16T20:18:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Panorama Dermatology","url":"http:\/\/www.panoramadermatologyclinic.co.za","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1824334637\/drjeanlouw__1__normal.jpg","description":"Dr. Jean Louw is a dermatologist in private practice at the Panorama Dermatology Clinic.","id_on_source":"panoramaderm","tweeter_id":"484636288","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":293},"tweet_id":"379700841462382592"}]}}
