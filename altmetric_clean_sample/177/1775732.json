To eliminate systematic uncertainties due to image registration, a workflow based entirely on MRI may be preferable. In the present pilot study, we investigate dose calculation accuracy for automatically generated substitute CT (s-CT) images of the head based on MRI. We also produce digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from s-CT data to evaluate the feasibility of patient positioning based on MR images.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003423","authors":["Jonsson, Joakim H.","Johansson, Adam","S\u00c3\u00b6derstr\u00c3\u00b6m, Karin","Asklund, Thomas","Nyholm, Tufve"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.radonc.2013.04.028","first_seen_on":"2013-09-23T14:53:22+00:00","issns":["0167-8140"],"journal":"Radiotherapy & Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1379416371,"links":["http:\/\/www.thegreenjournal.com\/article\/S0167-8140(13)00269-7\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=dlvr.it"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.thegreenjournal.com\/article\/S0167-8140(13)00269-7\/pdf","pmid":"23830190","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","radiotherapy"],"title":"Treatment planning of intracranial targets on MRI derived substitute CT data","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/treatment-planning-intracranial-targets-mri-derived-substitute-ct-data"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229091,"mean":5.9655632456766,"rank":5293822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229091,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109062,"mean":7.9309026691485,"rank":89759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109062,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1729,"mean":1.4303240740741,"rank":1021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1729,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":4.2306956521739,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
