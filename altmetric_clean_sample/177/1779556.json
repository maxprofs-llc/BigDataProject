Conflicting data exist regarding the association between antidepressant use and the incidence of CHD. This population-based study tracked the risk of composite coronary events in a cohort with newly diagnosed depression compared to an age- and gender-matched cohort without depression. The association between antidepressant use and risk of coronary events in individuals with depression was also investigated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b29","authors":["Huang, Chun-Jen","Hsieh, Ming-Hsiung","Hou, Wen-Hsuan","Liu, Ju-Chi","Jeng, Chii","Tsai, Pei-Shan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijcard.2013.07.173","first_seen_on":"2013-09-24T18:55:36+00:00","issns":["0167-5273"],"journal":"International Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1380048919,"links":["http:\/\/www.internationaljournalofcardiology.com\/article\/PIIS0167527313013983\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.internationaljournalofcardiology.com\/article\/S0167-5273(13)01398-3\/pdf","pmid":"23948112","pubdate":"2013-08-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Depression, antidepressants, and the risk of coronary heart disease: A population-based cohort study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/depression-antidepressants-risk-coronary-heart-disease-populationbased-cohort-study-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3068442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":945606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98170,"mean":7.7716726868973,"rank":66459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":19902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98170,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2087,"mean":1.9594295302013,"rank":900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":935,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2087,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":3.6506194690265,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
