In addition, this study investigated the effects of various treatment methods for patients with recurrent ICC.\nThis retrospective study analyzed the postoperative outcomes and prognostic factors of recurrent ICC that occurred for 81 of 128 patients who underwent hepatic resection for ICC between April 2001 and April 2013. In addition, the outcomes for a number of treatment methods were assessed for patients with recurrent ICC.\nAfter resection, the 128 patients with ICC had survival rates of 73\u00a0% at 1\u00a0year, 52\u00a0% at 3\u00a0years, and 43\u00a0% at 5\u00a0years. Recurrent ICC developed in 81 patients (56 men and 25 women) with a median age of 63\u00a0years. The median time from initial resection to recurrence was 9\u00a0months (range, 0-124\u00a0months), and the median survival time after recurrence was 8\u00a0months (range, 0-108\u00a0months). After recurrence, the overall survival rates were 47\u00a0% at 1\u00a0year, 23\u00a0% at 3\u00a0years, and 15\u00a0% at 5\u00a0years. Multivariate analysis showed disease-free survival time shorter than 1\u00a0year and bile duct invasion to be significant prognostic factors. Among the treatment methods, local management such as surgery, transarterial chemoembolization, and radiofrequency ablation were effective in select cases with localized intrahepatic and extrahepatic recurrence.\nActive local treatment (i.e., surgery, transarterial chemoembolization [TACE], and radiofrequency ablation [RFA]) may improve survival for patients with localized ICC recurrence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a31","authors":["Park, Hyeong Min","Yun, Sung Pil","Lee, Eung Chang","Lee, Seung Duk","Han, Sung-Sik","Kim, Seoung Hoon","Park, Sang-Jae","Hyeong Min Park","Sung Pil Yun","Eung Chang Lee","Seung Duk Lee","Sung-Sik Han","Seoung Hoon Kim","Sang-Jae Park"],"doi":"10.1245\/s10434-016-5454-2","first_seen_on":"2016-09-05T17:26:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1534-4681","1068-9265"],"issue":"13","journal":"Annals of Surgical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1479819665,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27581609?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1245\/s10434-016-5454-2"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1245%2Fs10434-016-5454-2.pdf","pmid":"27581609","pubdate":"2016-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","generalsurgery"],"title":"Outcomes for Patients with Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma After Surgery","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outcomes-patients-recurrent-intrahepatic-cholangiocarcinoma-after-surgery-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7724913,"mean":6.6254088328702,"rank":5564850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1883245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7724913,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245818,"mean":12.243814544966,"rank":161184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":70812,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245818,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1941,"mean":5.0381195876289,"rank":1246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1941,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":12.698737704918,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/772848449280544768","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11778129],"posted_on":"2016-09-05T17:26:43+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":377},"tweet_id":"772848449280544768"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnnSurgOncol\/statuses\/801047854085181440","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11778129],"posted_on":"2016-11-22T13:01:05+00:00","author":{"name":"AnnalsSurgOncology","url":"http:\/\/www.annsurgoncol.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/446647424983900161\/o1qswKmi_normal.jpeg","description":"Annals of Surgical Oncology publishes articles by surgical oncologists worldwide regarding surgical oncology research and education.","id_on_source":"AnnSurgOncol","tweeter_id":"2399897358","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2719},"tweet_id":"801047854085181440"}]}}
