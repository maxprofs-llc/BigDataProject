Genomes of primitive plants encode only a few AGO proteins. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes ten AGO proteins, designated AGO1 to AGO10. Most early studies focused on these ten proteins and their interacting sRNAs. AGOs in other flowering plant species have duplicated and diverged from this set, presumably corresponding to new, diverged or specific functions. Among these, the grass-specific AGO18 family has been discovered and implicated as playing important roles during plant reproduction and viral defense. This review covers our current knowledge about functions and features of AGO proteins in both eudicots and monocots and compares their similarities and differences. On the basis of these features, we propose a new nomenclature for some plant AGOs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a8","authors":["Zhang, Han","Xia, Rui","Meyers, Blake C","Walbot, Virginia"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pbi.2015.06.011","first_seen_on":"2015-07-21T10:19:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0356","13695266"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Plant Biology","last_mentioned_on":1441205424,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26190741?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1369526615000953"],"pmid":"26190741","pubdate":"2015-07-21T22:01:01+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Evolution, functions, and mysteries of plant ARGONAUTE proteins ","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evolution-functions-mysteries-plant-argonaute-proteins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5581516,"mean":6.395854038553,"rank":2566778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2874647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5581516,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193678,"mean":8.6065372966332,"rank":88082,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":98926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193678,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":491,"mean":2.7927102040816,"rank":235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":491,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":2.6357575757576,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Ph.
