In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), data on LVH, that is, prevalence and determinants, are inconsistent mainly because of different definitions and heterogeneity of study populations. We determined echocardiographic-based LVH prevalence and clinical factors independently associated with its development in a prospective cohort of patients with non-valvular (NV) AF. From the \"Atrial Fibrillation Registry for Ankle-brachial Index Prevalence Assessment: Collaborative Italian Study\"\u00a0(ARAPACIS) population, 1,184 patients with NVAF (mean age 72 \u00b1 11\u00a0years; 56% men) with complete data to define LVH were selected. ARAPACIS is a multicenter, observational, prospective, longitudinal on-going study designed to estimate prevalence of peripheral artery disease in patients with NVAF. We found a high prevalence of LVH (52%) in patients with NVAF. Compared to those without LVH, patients with AF with LVH were older and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and previous myocardial infarction (MI). A higher prevalence of ankle-brachial index \u22640.90 was seen in patients with LVH (22 vs 17%, p\u00a0= 0.0392). Patients with LVH were at significantly higher thromboembolic risk, with CHA2DS2-VASc \u22652 seen in 93% of LVH and in 73% of patients without LVH (p <0.05). Women with LVH had a higher prevalence of concentric hypertrophy than men (46% vs 29%, p\u00a0= 0.0003). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that female gender (odds ratio [OR] 2.80, p <0.0001), age (OR 1.03 per year, p <0.001), hypertension (OR 2.30, p <0.001), diabetes (OR 1.62, p\u00a0= 0.004), and previous MI (OR 1.96, p\u00a0= 0.001) were independently associated with LVH. In conclusion, patients with NVAF have a high prevalence of LVH, which is related to female gender, older age, hypertension, and previous MI. These patients are at high thromboembolic risk and deserve a holistic approach to cardiovascular prevention.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f0","authors":["Proietti, Marco","Marra, Alberto Maria","Tassone, Eliezer Joseph","De Vuono, Stefano","Corrao, Salvatore","Gobbi, Paolo","Perticone, Francesco","Corazza, Gino Roberto","Basili, Stefania","Lip, Gregory Y H","Violi, Francesco","Raparelli, Valeria",", ",", "],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjcard.2015.05.060","first_seen_on":"2015-07-18T15:11:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1913","0002-9149"],"journal":"American Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1449792000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26183791?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26183791\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.amjcard.2015.05.060"],"pmid":"26183791","pubdate":"2015-07-18T22:01:35+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Frequency of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy in Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/frequency-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-nonvalvular-atrial-fibrillation-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6737133,"mean":6.1593032756354,"rank":1545850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":5174908,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6737133,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224025,"mean":8.0070845891513,"rank":64132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":158946,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224025,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3340,"mean":4.3670278526505,"rank":820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":2512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3340,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":3.7475596330275,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
