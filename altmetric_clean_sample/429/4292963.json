Therefore, allogeneic (allo) HSCT has been applied to those patients in first complete remission (CR1), and has shown a long-term survival rate of approximately 50\u00a0%. In terms of myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen, higher dose of cyclophosphamide (CY) and total body irradiation (TBI) (the standard CY\u2009+\u2009TBI) has been generally applied to allo HSCT. Other MAC regimens such as busulfan-based or etoposide-based regimens have also been used. Among those, medium-dose etoposide (ETP) in addition to the standard CY\u2009+\u2009TBI conditioning regimen appears to be promising for allo HSCT in adult ALL when transplanted in ALL patients aged under 50\u00a0years in CR1 and also in CR2, showing an excellent outcome without increasing relapse or transplant-related mortality (TRM) rates. By contrast, reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have also been applied to adult ALL patients and favorable outcomes have been obtained; however, relapse and TRM rates remain high. Therefore, an allo HSCT conditioning regimen which deserves further study for adult ALL patients aged under 50\u00a0years in CR1 and CR2 appears to be medium-dose ETP\u2009+\u2009CY\u2009+\u2009TBI and RIC is suitable for patients aged over 50\u00a0years or for younger patients with comorbid conditions. On the contrary, new therapeutic strategies for adult ALL patients are increasingly utilized with better outcomes; namely, various tyrosine kinase inhibitors for Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive ALL, human leukocyte antigen-haploidentical HSCT, and pediatric-inspired regimens for Ph-negative ALL. Therefore, the optimal treatment modality should be selected considering patient's age, Ph-positivity, donor availability, risk classification, efficacy, and safety.","altmetric_jid":"508ef8273cf058c930000000","authors":["Masahiro Imamura","Akio Shigematsu"],"doi":"10.1186\/s40164-015-0015-0","first_seen_on":"2015-07-19T03:30:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2162-3619"],"journal":"Experimental Hematology & Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1437276617,"links":["http:\/\/www.ehoonline.org\/content\/4\/1\/20\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ehoonline.org\/content\/pdf\/s40164-015-0015-0.pdf","pmid":"26322249","pubdate":"2015-07-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","title":"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia: potential benefit of medium-dose etoposide-based conditioning","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/allogeneic-hematopoietic-stem-cell-transplantation-adult-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-potential-bene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5372803,"mean":6.2791140551991,"rank":2852320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1826332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5372803,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188979,"mean":8.6212349479835,"rank":103640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":66899,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188979,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":1.7042553191489,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.91666666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
