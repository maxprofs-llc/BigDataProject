In this study, the effects of essential oil extracted from Vitex agnus-castus (EOVAC) leaves were investigated in three behavioral models of nociception in adult male Wistar rats.\nChemical composition of EOVAC was analyzed using gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and also its possible toxicity was determined in mice. Analgesic effect of EOVAC was determined using tail immersion test, formalin test, and acetic acid-induced visceral pain in rats.\nEOVAC (s.c.) and morphine (i.p.) significantly (p<0.05) reduced pain responses in both formalin and tail immersion tests.\u00a0In the study of evolved mechanisms,\u00a0pretreatment with naloxone or atropine significantly (p <0.05) reversed the essential oil-induced analgesia in both formalin and tail immersion tests. Moreover, EOVAC and Piroxicam produced significant (p<0.05) inhibition in the acetic acid-induced writhing response. EOVAC did not show any mortality even at high dose (5 g\/kg, p.o.) of administration in toxicity test. Moreover, according to GC-MS results, major components of the EOVAC were \u03b1-pinene (14.83%), limonene (10.29%), \u03b2-caryophyllene (6.9%), sabinene (5.27%), and \u03b2-farnesene (5.9%).\nThese results suggest that endogenous opioidergic system as well as muscarinergic receptors of cholinergic system may be involve in the antinociceptive activity of Vitex agnus-castus essential oil in these models of pain in rats.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef762a83ee09648b5226","authors":["Khalilzadeh, Emad","Vafaei Saiah, Gholamreza","Hasannejad, Hamideh","Ghaderi, Adel","Ghaderi, Shahla","Hamidian, Gholamreza","Mahmoudi, Razzagh","Eshgi, Davoud","Zangisheh, Mahsa"],"first_seen_on":"2015-07-20T07:15:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2228-7930"],"issue":"3","journal":"Avicenna Journal of Phytomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1483997280,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26101755","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26101755"],"pmid":"26101755","pubdate":"2015-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Antinociceptive effects, acute toxicity and chemical composition of Vitex agnus-castus essential oil.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antinociceptive-effects-acute-toxicity-chemical-composition-vitex-agnuscastus-essential-oil-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029393,"mean":6.8051641093086,"rank":4232066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2234476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029393,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228873,"mean":8.3002420217415,"rank":121901,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":84268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228873,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":4.1895652173913,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.88888888888889,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
