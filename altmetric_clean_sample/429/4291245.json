RT-PCR together with Sanger sequencing verified the presence of the above-mentioned fusion transcript. All functional domains of BCL11B are retained in the chimeric protein. Abnormal expression of BCL11B coding regions subjected to control by the ZEB2 promoter seems to be the leukemogenic mechanism behind the translocation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Torkildsen, Synne","Gorunova, Ludmila","Beiske, Klaus","Tj\u00f8nnfjord, Geir E","Heim, Sverre","Panagopoulos, Ioannis","Synne Torkildsen","Ludmila Gorunova","Klaus Beiske","Geir E.
