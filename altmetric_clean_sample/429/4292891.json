Forty-three parents (72.1% female, mean age\u00b1SD=43.1\u00b15.6 years) were evaluated at baseline and after their children's (n=33, 54.5% female, mean age\u00b1SD=12.9\u00b12.7 years) randomized treatment with Group Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy or fluoxetine for 14 weeks. Validated instruments were administered by trained clinicians. Parents were assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Family Accommodation Scale (FAS) and the Family Environment Scale (FES). The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale was administered to children. Significant findings after the children's treatment include decreased family accommodation levels (participation, modification and distress\/consequences domains); increased cohesion and active-recreational components of the family environment. In addition, changes in the FAS distress\/consequences and the FES cohesion subscores were correlated with the children's clinical improvement. These results suggest that child-focused OCD treatment may have a positive impact on family accommodation and family environment. Future studies should further clarify the reciprocal influences of pediatric OCD treatment and family factors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d2","authors":["Gorenstein, Gabriela","Gorenstein, Clarice","de Oliveira, Melaine Cristina","Asbahr, Fernando Ramos","Shavitt, Roseli Gedanke"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.psychres.2015.07.050","first_seen_on":"2015-07-19T02:01:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0165-1781","1872-7123","01651781"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Psychiatry Research","last_mentioned_on":1460237645,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0165178115005077","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0165178115005077&_version=1&md5=14671ca3e32d4df27d8d1191e114de57","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26216164?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=anxietynews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.psy-journal.com\/article\/S0165178115005077\/pdf","pmid":"26216164","pubdate":"2015-07-29T22:00:57+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Child-focused treatment of pediatric OCD affects parental behavior and family environment ","type":"article","volume":"229","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/childfocused-treatment-pediatric-ocd-affects-parental-behavior-family-environment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7523579,"mean":6.5040957411445,"rank":3883660,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2104667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7523579,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226755,"mean":8.1668854176774,"rank":120497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":83610,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226755,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3497,"mean":4.5085932494279,"rank":1914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3497,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":205,"mean":7.1166666666667,"rank":121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":205,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
