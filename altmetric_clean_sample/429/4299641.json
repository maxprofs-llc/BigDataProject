Studies on complex formation reveal relatively higher binding constant for PC70BM\/2 complex in all the solvent studied. Solvent dependence of charge separation and charge recombination processes in PC70BM\/diporphyrin non-covalent complexes has been well established in present work. Donor-acceptor geometry and stabilization of the singlet excited state of the diporphyrin during charge recombination are considered to be the possible reasons for this behavior.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f61000359f","authors":["Ray, Anamika","Banerjee, Shrabanti","Ghosh, Shalini","Bauri, Ajoy K","Bhattacharya, Sumanta"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.saa.2015.06.006","first_seen_on":"2015-07-21T11:00:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-3557"],"journal":"Spectrochimica Acta Part A: Molecular & Biomolecular Spectroscopy","last_mentioned_on":1437476406,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26189161?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26189161","pubdate":"2015-07-21T22:01:32+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
