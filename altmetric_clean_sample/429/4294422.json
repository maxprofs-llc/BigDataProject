Cancer is driven by the somatic evolution of cell lineages. In this study, the evolution of somatic cancer cell lineages during carcinogenesis was modeled as an equilibrium point (ie, phenotype of attractor) shifting, the process of a nonlinear stochastic evolutionary biological network. This process is subject to intrinsic random fluctuations because of somatic genetic and epigenetic variations, as well as extrinsic disturbances because of carcinogens and stressors. In order to maintain the normal function (ie, phenotype) of an evolutionary biological network subjected to random intrinsic fluctuations and extrinsic disturbances, a network robustness scheme that incorporates natural selection needs to be developed. This can be accomplished by selecting certain genetic and epigenetic variations to modify the network structure to attenuate intrinsic fluctuations efficiently and to resist extrinsic disturbances in order to maintain the phenotype of the evolutionary biological network at an equilibrium point (attractor). However, during carcinogenesis, the remaining (or neutral) genetic and epigenetic variations accumulate, and the extrinsic disturbances become too large to maintain the normal phenotype at the desired equilibrium point for the nonlinear evolutionary biological network. Thus, the network is shifted to a cancer phenotype at a new equilibrium point that begins a new evolutionary process. In this study, the natural selection scheme of an evolutionary biological network of carcinogenesis was derived from a robust negative feedback scheme based on the nonlinear stochastic Nash game strategy. The evolvability and phenotypic robustness criteria of the evolutionary cancer network were also estimated by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi inequality - constrained optimization problem. The simulation revealed that the phenotypic shift of the lung cancer-associated cell network takes 54.5 years from a normal state to stage I cancer, 1.5 years from stage I to stage II cancer, and 2.5 years from stage II to stage III cancer, with a reasonable match for the statistical result of the average age of lung cancer. These results suggest that a robust negative feedback scheme, based on a stochastic evolutionary game strategy, plays a critical role in an evolutionary biological network of carcinogenesis under a natural selection scheme.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c67","authors":["Bor-Sen Chen","Kun-Wei Tsai","Cheng-Wei Li"],"doi":"10.4137\/ebo.s26195","first_seen_on":"2015-07-19T23:56:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1176-9343"],"journal":"Evolutionary Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1438859955,"links":["http:\/\/www.la-press.com\/using-nonlinear-stochastic-evolutionary-game-strategy-to-model-an-evol-article-a4951?source=rss","http:\/\/www.la-press.com\/article.php?article_id=4951","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26244004?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4137\/EBO.S26195","http:\/\/www.la-press.com\/using-nonlinear-stochastic-evolutionary-game-strategy-to-model-an-evol-article-a4951"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.la-press.com\/redirect_file.php?fileId=6633&filename=4951-EBO-Using-Nonlinear-Stochastic-Evolutionary-Game-Strategy-to-Model-an-Evol.pdf&fileType=pdf","pmid":"26244004","pubdate":"2015-07-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Science And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Computation Theory And Mathematics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Using Nonlinear Stochastic Evolutionary Game Strategy to Model an Evolutionary Biological Network of Organ Carcinogenesis Under a Natural Selection Scheme","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/using-nonlinear-stochastic-evolutionary-game-strategy-model-evolutionary-biological-network-organ-ca"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7306657,"mean":6.3706585551552,"rank":3518968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":3601580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7306657,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225469,"mean":8.1096893395073,"rank":108649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":107113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225469,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188,"mean":3.0319144385027,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":4.20325,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ebojournal\/status\/622917861757980672","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4294422],"posted_on":"2015-07-19T23:56:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Evol Bioinf journal","url":"http:\/\/www.la-press.com\/evolutionary-bioinformatics-journal-j17","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/149791548\/177449_logo_final_graphiconly_normal.JPG","description":"Evolutionary Bioinformatics open access journal published by Libertas Academica.","id_on_source":"ebojournal","tweeter_id":"33798203","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":168},"tweet_id":"622917861757980672"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/status\/629250375753732096","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4294422],"posted_on":"2015-08-06T11:19:15+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
