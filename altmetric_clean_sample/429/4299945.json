Glycans added to sites are unusual in terminating at high mannoses. We showed previously that the C-type lectins, DC-SIGN and mannose receptor, bound to FL surface Ig (sIg), generating an intracellular Ca(2+) flux. We have now mapped further intracellular pathways activated by DC-SIGN in a range of primary FL cells with detection of phosphorylated ERK1\/2, AKT and PLC\u03b32. The SYK inhibitor (tamatinib) or the BTK inhibitor (ibrutinib) each blocked phosphorylation. Activation by DC-SIGN occurred in both IgM+ and IgG+ cases and led to upregulation of MYC expression, with detection in vivo observed in lymph nodes. Unlike cells of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, FL cells expressed relatively high levels of sIg, unchanged by long-term incubation in vitro, indicating no antigen-mediated downregulation in vivo. In contrast, expression of CXCR4 increased in vitro. Engagement of sIg in FL cells or normal B cells by anti-Ig led to endocytosis in vitro as expected, but DC-SIGN, even when cross-linked, did not lead to significant endocytosis of sIg. These findings indicate that lectin binding generates signals via sIg but does not mediate endocytosis, potentially maintaining a supportive antigen-independent signal in vivo. Location of DC-SIGN in FL tissue revealed high levels in sinusoid-like structures and in some co-localized mononuclear cells, suggesting a role for lectin-expressing cells at this site.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["A Linley","S Krysov","M Ponzoni","PW Johnson","G Packham","FK Stevenson"],"doi":"10.1182\/blood-2015-04-640805","first_seen_on":"2015-07-21T12:12:51+00:00","funders":["niehs","cruk"],"issns":["1528-0020"],"journal":"Blood","last_mentioned_on":1452936022,"links":["http:\/\/www.bloodjournal.org\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/20\/blood-2015-04-640805?papetoc=&sso-checked=true","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26194765?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.bloodjournal.org\/content\/bloodjournal\/early\/2015\/07\/20\/blood-2015-04-640805.full.pdf","pmid":"26194765","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society of Hematology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Lectin binding to surface Ig variable regions provides a universal persistent activating signal for follicular lymphoma cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lectin-binding-surface-ig-variable-regions-provides-universal-persistent-activating-signal-follicula"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6978736,"mean":6.2380718316401,"rank":2923408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":3985913,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6978736,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224517,"mean":8.0600893566607,"rank":91146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":129035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224517,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8947,"mean":4.6374442208808,"rank":4372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8947,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198,"mean":3.962152284264,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
