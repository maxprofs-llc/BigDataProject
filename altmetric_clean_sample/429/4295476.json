Typical clinical practice has been to analyze testosterone in human serum. The degradation of TU to testosterone was evaluated in conditions typically used in clinical studies.\nFreshly collected whole blood was fortified with TU at known concentration. Serum was prepared and T concentration was determined by LC-MS\/MS. It was observed that TU degrades extensively to T in human blood under conditions typical of harvesting serum causing overestimation of T concentration of up to 243%. These results were confirmed in a clinical study in which serum and plasma samples were compared.\nIt was demonstrated that T must be analyzed in enzyme-inhibited plasma when TU is the administered medication.","altmetric_jid":"5587ebb72a83ee287f8b4567","authors":["Sylvain Lachance","Om Dhingra","James Bernstein","St\u00e9phanie Gagnon","Caroline Savard","Nathalie Pelletier","Nadine Boudreau","Ann L\u00e9vesque"],"doi":"10.4155\/fso.15.55","endpage":"10","first_seen_on":"2015-07-20T09:36:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2056-5623"],"issue":"4","journal":"Future Science OA","last_mentioned_on":1437385540,"links":["http:\/\/www.future-science.com\/doi\/full\/10.4155\/fso.15.55"],"pmcid":"PMC5137954","pmid":"28031910","pubdate":"2015-06-26T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","title":"Importance of measuring testosterone in enzyme-inhibited plasma for oral testosterone undecanoate androgen replacement therapy clinical trials","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/importance-measuring-testosterone-enzymeinhibited-plasma-oral-testosterone-undecanoate-androgen-repl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5376712,"mean":6.2846964625775,"rank":2854590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1827684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5376712,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188199,"mean":8.6139188407954,"rank":103207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":66608,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188199,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122,"mean":6.388694214876,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":5.2694146341463,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/fsgfso\/status\/623063807988871169","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4295476],"posted_on":"2015-07-20T09:36:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Future Science OA","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/q4tiPlRblq","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/534307524007034880\/rNTC4DiG_normal.jpeg","description":"Advances in basic, translational and clinical research for improving human health | #OpenAccess journal published by Future Science Group.
