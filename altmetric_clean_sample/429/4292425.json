Studies on glossectomy for obstructive sleep apnea that reported pre- and postoperative apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) score with 10 or more patients were included.\nA total of 18 articles with 522 patients treated with 3 glossectomy techniques (midline glossectomy, lingualplasty, and submucosal minimally invasive lingual excision) met inclusion criteria. Pooled analyses (baseline vs post surgery) showed a significant improvement in AHI (48.1 \u00b1 22.01 to 19.05 \u00b1 15.46, P < .0001), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS; 11.41 \u00b1 4.38 to 5.66 \u00b1 3.29, P < .0001), snoring visual analog scale (VAS; 9.08 \u00b1 1.21 to 3.14 \u00b1 2.41, P < .0001), and Lowest O2 saturation (76.67 \u00b1 10.58 to 84.09 \u00b1 7.90, P < .0001). Surgical success rate was 59.6% (95% CI, 53.0%-65.9%) and surgical cure was achieved in 22.5% (95% CI, 11.26%-36.26%) of cases. Acute complications occurred in 16.4% (79\/481) of reported patients. Glossectomy was used as a standalone therapy in 24 patients. In this limited cohort, significant reductions in AHI (41.84 \u00b1 32.05 to 25.02 \u00b1 20.43, P = .0354) and ESS (12.35 \u00b1 5.05 to 6.99 \u00b1 3.84, P < .0001) were likewise observed.\nGlossectomy significantly improves sleep outcomes as part of multilevel surgery in adult patients with OSA. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to analyze the role of glossectomy as a standalone procedure for the treatment of sleep apnea, although the evidence suggests positive outcomes in select patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c01","authors":["Murphey, Alexander W","Kandl, Jessica A","Nguyen, Shaun A","Weber, Aimee C","Gillespie, M Boyd","Alexander W.
