The present study was aimed at characterizing the effects of infralimbic prefrontal cortex (IL-PFC) DBS on several pre-clinical markers of the antidepressant-like response and at investigating putative non-neuronal mechanism underlying DBS action. We found that DBS induced an antidepressant-like response that was prevented by IL-PFC neuronal lesion and by adenosine A1 receptor antagonists including caffeine. Moreover, high frequency DBS induced a rapid increase of hippocampal mitosis and reversed the effects of stress on hippocampal synaptic metaplasticity. In addition, DBS increased spontaneous IL-PFC low-frequency oscillations and both raphe 5-HT firing activity and synaptogenesis. Unambiguously, a local glial lesion counteracted all these neurobiological effects of DBS. Further in vivo electrophysiological results revealed that this astrocytic modulation of DBS involved adenosine A1 receptors and K(+) buffering system. Finally, a glial lesion within the site of stimulation failed to counteract the beneficial effects of low frequency (30\u00a0Hz) DBS. It is proposed that an unaltered neuronal-glial system constitutes a major prerequisite to optimize antidepressant DBS efficacy. It is also suggested that decreasing frequency could heighten antidepressant response of partial responders.","altmetric_jid":"544fc66b2a83ee03188b4567","authors":["Eti\u00e9vant, A","Oosterhof, C","B\u00e9try, C","Abrial, E","Novo-Perez, M","Rovera, R","Scarna, H","Devader, C","Mazella, J","Wegener, G","S\u00e1nchez, C","Dkhissi-Benyahya, O","Gronfier, C","Coizet, V","Beaulieu, J M","Blier, P","Lucas, G","Haddjeri, N"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ebiom.2015.06.023","first_seen_on":"2015-07-18T03:37:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2352-3964"],"issue":"8","journal":"EBioMedicine","last_mentioned_on":1443891669,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2352396415300529","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26425697?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26425697?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26425697"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ebiomedicine.com\/article\/S2352396415300529\/pdf","pmid":"26425697","pubdate":"2015-10-02T10:22:29+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Astroglial Control of the Antidepressant-Like Effects of Prefrontal Cortex Deep Brain Stimulation.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/astroglial-control-antidepressantlike-effects-prefrontal-cortex-deep-brain-stimulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6422619,"mean":5.8865586600353,"rank":1453468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":4339075,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6422619,"percentile":67},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196160,"mean":8.6130428682856,"rank":61394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":131741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196160,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":662,"mean":19.634916792738,"rank":290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":662,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":10.275811965812,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
