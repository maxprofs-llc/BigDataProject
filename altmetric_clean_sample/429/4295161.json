This is relevant given high prevalence of depression and distress among diabetes patients. We aimed to test whether low well-being modifies the effects of the PRISMA self-management education program (Dutch DESMOND).\n297 primary care type 2 diabetes patients participated in the PRISMA observational study with a pre-post measurement design. Patients were grouped in low (n=63) and normal well-being (n=234). Low well-being was defined as either low mood (WHO-5<50) and\/or high diabetes-distress (PAID-5>8). Outcome measures were: diabetes self-efficacy (CIDS), illness perception (IPQ) and diabetes self-care activities (SDSCA).\nImprovements were found in illness perception (b=1.586, p<0.001), general diet (b=1.508, p=0.001), foot care (b=0.678, p=0.037), weekly average diet (b=1.140, p=0.001), creating action plan (b=0.405, p=0.007). Well-being interaction effects were found for general diet (p=0.009), weekly average diet (p=0.022), and creating an action plan (p=0.002).\nPRISMA self-management education seems as effective for people with normal well-being as for people with low well-being. Further research should examine whether addressing mood and diabetes-distress as part of self-management education could reduce attrition and maintain or improve well-being among participants.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f6100085c1","authors":["van Vugt, Michael","de Wit, Maartje","Bader, Suzanne","Snoek, Frank J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pcd.2015.06.008","first_seen_on":"2015-07-20T06:36:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-0210"],"journal":"Primary Care Diabetes","last_mentioned_on":1437375019,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26186886"],"pmid":"26186886","pubdate":"2015-07-20T22:00:48+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["primaryhealthcare","endocrinology"],"title":"Does low well-being modify the effects of PRISMA (Dutch DESMOND), a structured self-management-education program for people with type 2 diabetes?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/low-wellbeing-modify-effects-prisma-dutch-desmond-structured-selfmanagementeducation-program-people"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5376442,"mean":6.2846561790594,"rank":2615939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2708385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5376442,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188196,"mean":8.6140343686072,"rank":92009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":94302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188196,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":2.7649612403101,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":2.5166666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
