Numerous therapeutic interventions for CVDs have been directed towards the inhibition of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation that contributes to the detrimental effect after ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R) injuries. However, the efficacy of these treatments is far from ideal as they lack specificity and are associated with high toxicity. Previously, we demonstrated that N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) pre-treatment up-regulates DUSP4 expression in endothelial cells, regulating p38 and ERK1\/2 activities, thus providing a protective effect against oxidative stress. Here, endothelial cells under hypoxia\/reoxygenation (H\/R) insult and isolated heart I\/R injury were used to investigate the role of DUSP4 on the modulation of the p38 pathway. In rat endothelial cells, DUSP4 is time-dependently degraded with H\/R (0.25\u00b10.07 fold change of control after 2h H\/R). Its degradation is closely associated with hyper-phosphorylation of p38 (2.1\u00b10.36 fold change) and cell apoptosis, as indicated by the increase in cells immunopositive for cleaved caspase-3 (12.59%\u00b13.38%) or TUNEL labeling (29.46%\u00b13.75%). The inhibition of p38 kinase activity with 20\u00b5M SB203580 during H\/R prevents H\/R-induced apoptosis, assessed via TUNEL (12.99%\u00b11.89%). Conversely, DUSP4 gene silencing in endothelial cells augments their sensitivity to H\/R-induced apoptosis (45.81%\u00b15.23%). This sensitivity is diminished via the inhibition of p38 activity (total apoptotic cells drop to 17.47%\u00b11.45%). Interestingly, DUSP4 gene silencing contributes to the increase in superoxide generation from cells. Isolated Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts were subjected to global I\/R injury. DUSP4(-\/-) hearts had significantly larger infarct size than WT. The increase in I\/R-induced infarct in DUSP4(-\/-) mice significantly correlates with reduced functional recovery (assessed by: RPP%, LVDP%, HR%, and dP\/dtmax) as well as lower CF% and a higher initial LVEDP. From immunoblotting analysis, it is evident that p38 is significantly over-activated in DUSP4(-\/-) mice after I\/R injury. The activation of cleaved caspase-3 is seen in both WT and DUSP4(-\/-) I\/R hearts. Infusion of a p38 inhibitor prior to ischemia and during the reperfusion improves both WT and DUSP4(-\/-) cardiac function. Therefore, the identification of p38 kinase modulation by DUSP4 provides a novel therapeutic target for oxidant-induced diseases, especially myocardial infarction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002911","authors":["Barajas-Espinosa, Alma","Basye, Ariel","Angelos, Mark G","Chen, Chun-An"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.freeradbiomed.2015.07.013","first_seen_on":"2015-07-18T14:06:47+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1873-4596"],"journal":"Free Radical Biology & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1437227166,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26184564?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26184564","pubdate":"2015-07-18T22:01:12+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biochemistry"],"title":"Modulation of p38 kinase by DUSP4 Is important in regulating cardiovascular function under oxidative stress.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modulation-p38-kinase-dusp4-important-regulating-cardiovascular-function-under-oxidative-stress"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5366929,"mean":6.2764892370478,"rank":4466772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5366929,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189451,"mean":8.6045200527845,"rank":152515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189451,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1319,"mean":4.0225098634294,"rank":1030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1319,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":3.4573170731707,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
