A variety of exosomal functions have been reported, including transfer of RNA, cell communication, control of apoptosis and protein lifespan. Exosomes from mesenchymal stem cells can rescue bioenergetics of injured cells. Here the urinary exosome proteome, non-urinary exosome proteome and urinome are compared. A consistent number of identified proteins cluster to metabolic functions. Cytoscape software analysis based on biological processes gene ontology database shows that metabolic pathways such as aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation have a high probability (p \u2264 0.05) of being expressed and therefore functional. A metabolic function appears to be associated with human urinary exosomes, whose relevance experimental studies can assess.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d9","authors":["Bruschi, Maurizio","Ravera, Silvia","Santucci, Laura","Candiano, Giovanni","Bartolucci, Martina","Calzia, Daniela","Lavarello, Chiara","Inglese, Elvira","Petretto, Andrea","Ghiggeri, Gianmarco","Panfoli, Isabella"],"doi":"10.1586\/14789450.2015.1055324","first_seen_on":"2015-07-18T10:36:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-8387"],"issue":"4","journal":"Expert Review of Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1437215720,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26186710?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26186710","pubdate":"2015-07-18T22:00:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The human urinary exosome as a potential metabolic effector cargo.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-urinary-exosome-metabolic-effector-cargo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5366929,"mean":6.2764892370478,"rank":4466771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5366929,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189451,"mean":8.6045187331751,"rank":152514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189451,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240,"mean":1.3858158995816,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.7653846153846,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
