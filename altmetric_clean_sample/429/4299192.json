Longer LOS was associated with Age (\u226565years), BMI \u226530kg\/m(2), ASA score >2, minority race\/ethnicity, low SES, general anesthesia, comorbidities of the Circulatory, Genitourinary and Respiratory systems, and operating time. Collectively, being of low SES, advanced age (\u226565years) and minority race\/ethnicity was most significantly associated with prolonged LOS (>7days). The combined associations of lower SES, female gender, advanced age, non-Caucasian race\/ethnicity and certain comorbidities presented a synergistically elevated risk for longer LOS and may warrant the need to consider sociodemographic status when allocating resources to hospitals serving such patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6203cf058f610007b79","authors":["Inneh, Ifeoma A","Iorio, Richard","Slover, James D","Bosco, Joseph A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.arth.2015.06.054","first_seen_on":"2015-07-21T10:19:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-8406"],"journal":"The Journal of Arthroplasty","last_mentioned_on":1472896993,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26190570?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26190570","pubdate":"2015-07-21T22:01:03+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Role of Sociodemographic, Co-morbid and Intraoperative Factors in Length of Stay Following Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-sociodemographic-comorbid-intraoperative-factors-length-stay-following-primary-total-hip-arthro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":7193982,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231342,"mean":8.4339823636969,"rank":192713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231342,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1444,"mean":4.9132501732502,"rank":1296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1444,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.7366666666667,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
