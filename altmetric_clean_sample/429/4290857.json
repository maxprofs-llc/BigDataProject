This study explored the associations between schizophrenia risk and serum levels of 10 trace elements. A 1:1 matched case-control study was conducted and matched by age and sex. Blood samples were collected to determine the concentrations of nickel, molybdenum, arsenic, aluminum, chromium, manganese, selenium, copper, iron and zinc by an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The conditional logistic regression model was used to analyze the associations between trace elements and schizophrenia risk. Totally 114 schizophrenia patients and 114 healthy controls were recruited in the study. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that copper\u22640.97 \u03bcg\/mL, selenium\u226472 ng\/mL and manganese>3.95 ng\/mL were associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia. The study showed that lower levels of selenium, copper and higher levels of manganese were found in schizophrenia patients compared with healthy controls.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Liu, Tiebing","Lu, Qing-Bin","Yan, Lailai","Guo, Jing","Feng, Fangbo","Qiu, Jinyun","Wang, Jingyu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0133622","first_seen_on":"2015-07-18T10:02:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1463048111,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26186003?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0133622","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26186003","http:\/\/feeds.plos.org\/~r\/plosone\/PLoSONE\/~3\/W9l9Bj-HyVg\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0133622"],"pmid":"26186003","pubdate":"2015-07-18T22:00:27+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Comparative Study on Serum Levels of 10 Trace Elements in Schizophrenia","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-study-serum-levels-10-trace-elements-schizophrenia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.02,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.02},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7690302,"mean":6.5973724521265,"rank":494557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7195723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7690302,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228387,"mean":8.1952471079664,"rank":20996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":207391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228387,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109346,"mean":10.241882390599,"rank":11369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":97978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109346,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6458,"mean":9.367503174849,"rank":635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":5823,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6458,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
