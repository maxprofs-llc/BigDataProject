Our microwave-assisted post-synthetic modification method yields enantiopure peptides anchored inside MOF cavities. Al-MIL-101-NH2, In-MIL-68-NH2 and Zr-UiO-66-NH2 were chosen as starting platforms. A single amino acid and various oligopeptides are grafted with yields up to 60% after a 30-minutes microwave-assisted coupling-deprotection sequence. This allows efficient preparation of a library of functional hybrid solids for molecular recognition applications such as sensing, separation or asymmetric catalysis, as demonstrated here for the chiral aldol reaction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Jonathan Bonnefoy"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.5b05327","first_seen_on":"2015-07-20T19:57:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1486365946,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.5b05327"],"pmid":"26120932","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Enantiopure Peptide-Functionalized Metal\u2013Organic Frameworks","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enantiopure-peptidefunctionalized-metalorganic-frameworks"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170298,"mean":6.9145785001388,"rank":1916468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6217142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170298,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229466,"mean":8.3735589567037,"rank":63124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":165244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229466,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19013,"mean":5.2677172312224,"rank":5826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":13111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19013,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245,"mean":8.105262295082,"rank":106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
