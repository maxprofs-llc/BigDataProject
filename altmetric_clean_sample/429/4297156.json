Inclusion criteria included the following: use of an objective measure of cognition and sufficient data reported to estimate an effect size. The meta-analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. A random-effects model was used to calculate the overall weighted effect sizes, expressed as Hedge g.\nFifteen RCTs and 7 acute exposure studies examined the effects of yoga on cognition. A moderate effect (g = 0.33, standard error = 0.08, 95% confidence interval = 0.18-0.48, p < .001) of yoga on cognition was observed for RCTs, with the strongest effect for attention and processing speed (g = 0.29, p < .001), followed by executive function (g = 0.27, p = .001) and memory (g = 0.18, p = .051). Acute studies showed a stronger overall effect of yoga on cognition (g = 0.56, standard error = 0.11, 95% confidence interval = 0.33-0.78, p < .001). The effect was strongest for memory (g = 0.78, p < .001), followed by attention and processing speed measures (g = 0.49, p < .001) and executive functions (g = 0.39, p < .003).\nYoga practice seems to be associated with moderate improvements in cognitive function. Although the studies are limited by sample size, heterogeneous population characteristics, varied doses of yoga interventions, and a myriad of cognitive tests, these findings warrant rigorous systematic RCTs and well-designed counterbalanced acute studies to comprehensively explore yoga as a means to improve or sustain cognitive abilities across the life span.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008675","authors":["Gothe, Neha P","McAuley, Edward","Gothe, Neha P."],"doi":"10.1097\/psy.0000000000000218","endpage":"797","first_seen_on":"2015-07-20T20:08:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1534-7796","0033-3174"],"issue":"7","journal":"Psychosomatic Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1477537450,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/psychosomaticmedicine\/pages\/articleviewer.aspx?article=99064&issue=00000&type=abstract&year=9000","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26186435\/?i=1&from=yoga%20cognition","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26186435","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/PSY.0000000000000218","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/psychosomaticmedicine\/Citation\/2015\/09000\/Yoga_and_Cognition___A_Meta_Analysis_of_Chronic.9.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/psychosomaticmedicine\/Abstract\/2015\/09000\/Yoga_and_Cognition___A_Meta_Analysis_of_Chronic.9.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/psychosomaticmedicine\/9000\/00000\/Yoga_and_Cognition___A_Meta_Analysis_of_Chronic.99064.pdf","pmid":"26186435","pubdate":"2015-07-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"784","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Yoga and Cognition: A Meta-Analysis of Chronic and Acute Effects","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/psychosomaticmedicine\/Fulltext\/2015\/09000\/Yoga_and_Cognition___A_Meta_Analysis_of_Chronic.9.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/yoga-cognition-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.65,"score_history":{"1y":1.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.65},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7601780,"mean":6.5482482934541,"rank":499093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7102168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7601780,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226418,"mean":8.1610107191599,"rank":21377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":205009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226418,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1594,"mean":8.8163691148776,"rank":149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":1445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1594,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":7.3112307692308,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":10,"researcher":6,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":7,"Members of the public":8,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
