Few studies have investigated the relation between early childhood growth and adult lung function.\nFEV1 and FVC were measured at ages 43 years, 53 years and 60-64\u2005years in the 1946 British birth cohort study. Multiple linear regression models were fitted to study associations with birth weight and weight gain at age 0-2\u2005years. Multilevel models assessed how associations changed with age, with FEV1 and FVC as repeated outcomes.\n3276 and 3249 participants were included in FEV1 and FVC analyses, respectively. In women, there was a decreasing association between birth weight and FVC with age. From the multilevel model, for every 1\u2005kg higher birth weight, FVC was higher on average by 66.3\u2005mL (95% CI 0.5 to 132) at 43\u2005years, but significance was lost at 53 years and 60-64\u2005years. Similar associations were seen with FEV1, but linear change (decline) from age 43\u2005years lost statistical significance after full adjustment. In men, associations with birth weight were null in multilevel models. Higher early life weight gain was associated with higher FEV1 at age 43\u2005years in men and women combined but not in each sex.\nBirth weight is positively associated with adult lung function in middle age, particularly in women, but the association diminishes with age, potentially due to accumulating environmental influences over the life course.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003664","authors":["Cai, Yutong","Shaheen, Seif O","Hardy, Rebecca","Kuh, Diana","Hansell, Anna L","Yutong Cai","Seif O Shaheen","Rebecca Hardy","Diana Kuh","Anna L Hansell"],"doi":"10.1136\/thoraxjnl-2014-206457","endpage":"922","first_seen_on":"2015-07-19T07:00:37+00:00","funders":["niehs","mrc"],"issns":["1468-3296"],"issue":"10","journal":"Thorax","last_mentioned_on":1476289853,"links":["http:\/\/m.thorax.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/16\/thoraxjnl-2014-206457.short?rss=1","http:\/\/thorax.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/16\/thoraxjnl-2014-206457.abstract?papetoc=","http:\/\/m.thorax.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/16\/thoraxjnl-2014-206457.short?rss=1&utm_content=buffer6257d&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/thorax.bmj.com\/content\/71\/10\/916?etoc","http:\/\/thorax.bmj.com\/content\/71\/10\/916.abstract?etoc","http:\/\/thorax.bmj.com\/content\/71\/10\/916.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/thorax.bmj.com\/content\/71\/10\/916.full.pdf","pmid":"26185199","pubdate":"2015-07-19T22:01:30+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and British Thoracic Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"916","subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Birth weight, early childhood growth and lung function in middle to early old age: 1946 British birth cohort.","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/birth-weight-early-childhood-growth-lung-function-middle-early-old-age-1946-british-birth-cohort"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.7,"score_history":{"1y":2.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8214888,"mean":6.9557961245171,"rank":1692037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6514097,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8214888,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230481,"mean":8.4123014231171,"rank":54515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":175543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230481,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2894,"mean":9.5966837193225,"rank":998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":1892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2894,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":12.902542372881,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":7,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
