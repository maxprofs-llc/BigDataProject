A standardized and objective scoring of embryo 'quality' is therefore crucial in the classification and selection of embryos. However, embryo scoring is still being performed mainly via ocular evaluation, which often results in different interpretations of embryo quality. The addition of viability markers, such as measuring gene expression or the uptake\/release of metabolites, proteins or RNA\/DNA molecules in the culture media, would increase the possibility of standardized measurements. However, no single biomarker has yet been introduced into standard clinical practice, mainly due to the complexity of the techniques and the influence of biological variations and differences in culture conditions. In this paper different methods for the scoring of embryos and the possibility of standardizing and implementing quality control systems are discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f61000345c","authors":["Lundin, Kersti","Ahlstr\u00f6m, Aisling"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.rbmo.2015.06.026","first_seen_on":"2015-07-21T04:12:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1472-6483","1472-6491"],"journal":"Reproductive BioMedicine Online","last_mentioned_on":1437625483,"links":["http:\/\/www.rbmojournal.com\/article\/S1472-6483(15)00362-4\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.rbmojournal.com\/article\/S1472648315003624\/pdf","pmid":"26277586","pubdate":"2015-08-17T22:00:13+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Quality control and standardization of embryo morphology scoring and viability markers","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quality-control-standardization-embryo-morphology-scoring-viability-markers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5393711,"mean":6.2953748280863,"rank":3570904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1598382,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5393711,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189714,"mean":8.6302713572608,"rank":122681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":57959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189714,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":638,"mean":3.3081726844584,"rank":397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":638,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":12.047333333333,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
