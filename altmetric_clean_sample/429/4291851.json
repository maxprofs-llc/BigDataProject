Most of our current knowledge about the physiological properties has been derived from the motor cortex. The integration of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) is a valuable method for directly probing excitability, connectivity and oscillatory dynamics of regions throughout the brain. Offering in depth measurement of cortical reactivity, TMS-EEG allows the evaluation of TMS-evoked components that may act as a marker for cortical excitation and inhibition. A growing body of research is using concurrent TMS and EEG (TMS-EEG) to explore the effects of different neuromodulatory techniques such as repetitive TMS and transcranial direct current stimulation on cortical function, particularly in non-motor regions. In this review, we outline studies examining TMS-evoked potentials and oscillations before and after, or during a single session of brain stimulation. Investigating these studies will aid in our understanding of mechanisms involved in the modulation of excitability and inhibition by neuroplasticity following different stimulation paradigms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006ce7","authors":["Chung, Sung Wook","Rogasch, Nigel C","Hoy, Kate E","Fitzgerald, Paul B"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.brs.2015.07.029","first_seen_on":"2015-07-18T14:04:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1935-861X"],"journal":"Brain Stimulation","last_mentioned_on":1439739505,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1935861X15010542","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26275346"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.brainstimjrnl.com\/article\/S1935861X15010542\/pdf","pmid":"26275346","pubdate":"2015-08-16T11:56:54+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Measuring Brain Stimulation Induced Changes in Cortical Properties Using TMS-EEG.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measuring-brain-stimulation-induced-changes-cortical-properties-using-tmseeg"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5487712,"mean":6.3730424488449,"rank":2163318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":3289922,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5487712,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193668,"mean":8.5566124946429,"rank":70640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":121386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193668,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":481,"mean":5.8185833333333,"rank":168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":481,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":3.7976,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Ph.
