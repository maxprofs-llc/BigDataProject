However, the anthocyanin with the highest content in V. amurensis Rupr has not yet been identified. In this study, pulsed electric field extraction and semi-preparative liquid phase separation were used to isolate the anthocyanin monomer from 'Beibinghong'. UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, mass spectra and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to identify the anthocyanin monomer. The antioxidant activities of the anthocyanin monomer were also analysed. Malvidin-3,5-O-diglucoside was identified as the main anthocyanin in V. amurensis Rupr, which could be used as a raw material for its extraction. Furthermore, malvidin-3,5-O-diglucoside can be potentially used as a functional food, and a novel therapeutic and preventive agent for oxidative stress-related diseases. This study provides technical information for the future purification and structural identification of anthocyanins.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d63cf058f6100010b5","authors":["He, Yang","Wen, Liankui","Yu, Hansong","Cao, Yong","Nan, Hailong","Gou, Mengxing","Xie, Chunyang","Xue, Hai"],"doi":"10.1080\/14786419.2017.1361956","first_seen_on":"2017-08-08T10:30:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1478-6419","1478-6427"],"journal":"Natural Product Research","last_mentioned_on":1502188208,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28782379?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28782379","pubdate":"2017-08-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Informa UK Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Isolation and structural identification of the main anthocyanin monomer in Vitis amurensis Rupr","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":7212874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177218,"mean":12.249767020094,"rank":144985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177218,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":726,"mean":1.3436303448276,"rank":424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":726,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":0.78703703703704,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SoybeanPapers\/statuses\/894868321895464961","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23510942],"posted_on":"2017-08-08T10:30:08+00:00","author":{"name":"SoybeanPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/827928262294720513\/Z7taAmCb_normal.jpg","description":"Soybean Literature","id_on_source":"SoybeanPapers","tweeter_id":"827920594809257989","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":32},"tweet_id":"894868321895464961"}]}}
