A computerized search was conducted for randomized controlled trials of stem cell therapy for STEMI.\nTwenty-eight randomized controlled trials with a total of 1,938 STEMI patients were included in the present meta-analysis. Stem cell therapy resulted in an improvement in long-term (12 months) left ventricular ejection fraction of 3.15% (95% confidence interval 1.01-5.29, P<0.01). The 3-month to 4-month, 6-month, and 12-month left ventricular end-systolic volume showed favorable results in the stem cell therapy group compared with the control group (P\u22640.05). Significant decrease was also observed in left ventricular end-diastolic volume after 3-month to 4-month and 12-month follow-up compared with controls (P<0.05). Wall mean score index was reduced significantly in stem cell therapy group when compared with the control group at 6-month and 12-month follow-up (P=0.01). Moreover, our analysis showed a significant change of 12-month infarct size decrease in STEMI patients treated with stem cells compared with controls (P<0.01). In addition, no significant difference was found between treatment group and control in adverse reactions (P>0.05).\nOverall, stem cell therapy is efficacious in the treatment of patients with STEMI, with low rates of adverse events compared with control group patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b5e","authors":["Rong Li","Xiao-Ming Li","Jun-Rong Chen"],"doi":"10.2147\/tcrm.s107199","first_seen_on":"2016-08-02T03:11:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1176-6336"],"journal":"Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management","last_mentioned_on":1470155369,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/clinical-efficacy-and-safety-of-autologous-stem-cell-transplantation-f-peer-reviewed-article-TCRM"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=31657","pmid":"27536122","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Social Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Clinical efficacy and safety of autologous stem cell transplantation for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-efficacy-safety-autologous-stem-cell-transplantation-patients-stsegment-elevation-myocardia-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155605,"mean":6.9067370031636,"rank":3724883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4349314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155605,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257721,"mean":11.996805952196,"rank":112728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":140394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257721,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":687,"mean":3.8274548104956,"rank":295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":687,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":2.2367346938776,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DovePatient\/statuses\/760311940673523713","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10196913],"posted_on":"2016-08-02T03:11:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Dove Press Patient","url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/browse_journals.php?pa=view&cat_id=23","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/294760240\/DoveLogoBlock-75_normal.jpg","description":"Latest articles covering all areas of patient care, published in Dove Press open access medical and scientific journals","id_on_source":"DovePatient","tweeter_id":"53258840","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":7},"tweet_id":"760311940673523713"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/StemcellWatch\/statuses\/760324786090151936","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10196913],"posted_on":"2016-08-02T04:02:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Stem cell Watch","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2974988642\/252972fe389b7bcf03c80859a4650e4c_normal.jpeg","description":"Follow us to get the latest news about Stem cell","id_on_source":"StemcellWatch","tweeter_id":"620487016","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":3464},"tweet_id":"760324786090151936"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DoveEpidem\/statuses\/760357243397165056","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10196913],"posted_on":"2016-08-02T06:11:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Dove Epidemiology","url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/browse_journals.php?pa=view&cat_id=8","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/294779226\/DoveLogoBlock-75_normal.jpg","description":"Latest Epidemiology and Public Health articles published in Dove Press open access medical and scientific journals","id_on_source":"DoveEpidem","tweeter_id":"53262268","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":100},"tweet_id":"760357243397165056"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Clinical efficacy and safety of autologous stem cell transplantation f | TCRM","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=525623114309628&id=203375069867769","license":"public","citation_ids":[10196913],"posted_on":"2016-08-02T16:29:29+00:00","summary":"For a certain kind of heart attack, STEMI, this study is compelling.
