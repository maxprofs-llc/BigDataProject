The calculations utilize the temperature (T) dependent distribution of species present in MAO determined recently by Zurek and coworkers from first-principles theory [Macromolecules, 2014, 47, 8556]. The NMR calculations suggest that variable-T and variable-B NMR measurements are able to quantify the ratio of free versus bound trimethyl-aluminum (TMA) in MAO via characteristic spectral features assigned to 3-coordinate and 4-coordinate Al sites in MAO as well as spectral features arising from free TMA or its dimer. The T-dependent distribution of species causes other characteristic features in the NMR spectra to appear\/disappear that can be associated with different aluminum environments such as square vs. hexagonal faces in cage and tubular structures. The simulated spectra at 298 K and 19.6 T are in reasonably good agreement with the experimental solid-state NMR (SSNMR) spectra obtained previously for MAO gel. The promise and limitations of solid-state NMR to unravel the enigma surrounding the structure(s) of MAO are discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ee3","authors":["Zackary Falls","Eva Zurek","Jochen Autschbach"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6cp04260k","endpage":"24118","first_seen_on":"2016-08-01T23:47:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1463-9084"],"issue":"34","journal":"Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics (PCCP)","last_mentioned_on":1471272740,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/CP\/C6CP04260K#!divAbstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/cp\/c6cp04260k","pmid":"27526292","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"24106","subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Computational prediction and analysis of the 27Al solid-state NMR spectrum of methylaluminoxane (MAO) at variable temperatures and field strengths","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/computational-prediction-analysis-27al-solidstate-nmr-spectrum-methylaluminoxane-mao-variable-temper"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":3886258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4149927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258306,"mean":12.014318770445,"rank":119121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":130795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258306,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4134,"mean":2.1019133801113,"rank":981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":2998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4134,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134,"mean":2.3637293233083,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/solidstateNMR\/statuses\/760257094872281089","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10192900],"posted_on":"2016-08-01T23:33:10+00:00","author":{"name":"New SSNMR Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/876625113663262720\/Jp6jB0ID_normal.jpg","description":"Updated by Luke O'Dell, Senior Lecturer in NMR Spectroscopy at Deakin University, Australia.","id_on_source":"solidstateNMR","tweeter_id":"241202626","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":516},"tweet_id":"760257094872281089"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PCCP\/statuses\/761205933485719552","license":"gnip","rt":["solidstateNMR"],"citation_ids":[10192900],"posted_on":"2016-08-04T14:23:31+00:00","author":{"name":"PCCP","url":"http:\/\/www.rsc.org\/pccp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/485009992999649280\/2-fdQwwQ_normal.jpeg","description":"Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics - the flagship physical chemistry journal published by the RSC - latest impact factor 4.49","id_on_source":"PCCP","tweeter_id":"23572559","geo":{"lt":52.2,"ln":0.11667,"country":"GB"},"followers":4101},"tweet_id":"761205933485719552"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SCM_Amsterdam\/statuses\/765199451279486976","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10192900],"posted_on":"2016-08-15T14:52:20+00:00","author":{"name":"SCM","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/vzU0lmDGkz","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/707933025393201152\/AZ0Nx4xA_normal.jpg","description":"Density Functional Theory.
