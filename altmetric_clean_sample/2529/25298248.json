We analyzed the incidence of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in all patients and local recurrence and overall survival (OS) in T1a-2a patients.\nA total of 508 patients were eligible, including 42 with IIPs. The median follow-up was 32.3 (6.0-120.9) months. Significantly more patients with IIPs had grade \u22653RP than did those without IIPs (12% vs. 3%, p=0.009). The 2-year local recurrence rate was low in both groups (3.4% vs. 5.6%, p=0.38). The 2-year OS rate was significantly lower in the patients with IIPs (42.2% vs. 80.9%, p<0.001), although death from lung cancer was comparable (p=0.74).\nSBRT achieved excellent local control with acceptable pulmonary toxicity in lung cancer patients with IIPs. SBRT can be a reasonable option for early lung cancer patients with IIPs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003423","authors":["Tsurugai, Yuichiro","Takeda, Atsuya","Sanuki, Naoko","Enomoto, Tatsuji","Kaneko, Takeshi","Hara, Yu","Mizuno, Tomikazu","Saeki, Noriyuki","Aoki, Yousuke","Oku, Yohei","Akiba, Takeshi","Kunieda, Etsuo","Yuichiro Tsurugai","Atsuya Takeda","Naoko Sanuki","Tatsuji Enomoto","Takeshi Kaneko","Yu Hara","Tomikazu Mizuno","Noriyuki Saeki","Yousuke Aoki","Yohei Oku","Takeshi Akiba","Etsuo Kunieda"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.radonc.2017.08.026","first_seen_on":"2017-09-15T02:46:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0167-8140","01678140","1879-0887"],"journal":"Radiotherapy & Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1506325025,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0167814017325495&_version=1&md5=4f23987efd8086d91ef3c0b2dcd6633c","http:\/\/www.thegreenjournal.com\/article\/S0167-8140(17)32549-5\/fulltext?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0167814017325495?via%3Dihub"],"pmid":"28919004","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","radiotherapy"],"title":"Stereotactic body radiotherapy for lung cancer patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stereotactic-body-radiotherapy-lung-cancer-patients-idiopathic-interstitial-pneumonias"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":1.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":4022597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4251406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151318,"mean":11.846367625581,"rank":67745,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":79039,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151318,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2195,"mean":2.2224776663628,"rank":597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":1518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2195,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":1.8686567164179,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/medphyspapers\/statuses\/908514783770611713","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25298248],"posted_on":"2017-09-15T02:16:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Med Phys Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"New publications in Medical Physics and Radiotherapy.","id_on_source":"medphyspapers","tweeter_id":"2879791906","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":136},"tweet_id":"908514783770611713"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pristinepeak\/statuses\/908725616496619521","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25298248],"posted_on":"2017-09-15T16:14:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Pristine Peak","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1203819152\/miniature-rose-1_normal.jpg","description":"Radoncologist by profession.
