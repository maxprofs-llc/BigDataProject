We investigated the effects of IL-12 inhibition on vascular and left ventricular (LV) function in psoriasis.\nOne hundred fifty psoriasis patients were randomized to receive an anti-IL-12\/23 (ustekinumab, n=50), anti-tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-\u03b1; etanercept, n=50), or cyclosporine treatment (n=50). At baseline and 4 months post-treatment, we measured (1) LV global longitudinal strain, twisting, and percent difference between peak twisting and untwisting at mitral valve opening (%untwMVO) using speckle-tracking echocardiography, (2) coronary flow reserve, (3) pulse wave velocity and augmentation index, (4) circulating NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, malondialdehyde, and fetuin-a. Compared with baseline, all patients had improved global longitudinal strain (median values: -17.7% versus -19.5%), LV twisting (12.4\u00b0 versus 14\u00b0), %untwMVO (27.8% versus 35%), and coronary flow reserve (2.8 versus 3.1) and reduced circulating NT-proBNP, IL-17, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 post-treatment (P<0.05). Compared with anti-TNF-\u03b1 and cyclosporine, anti-IL-12\/23 treatment resulted in a greater improvement of global longitudinal strain (25% versus 17% versus 6%,), LV twist (27% versus 17% versus 1%), %untwMVO (31% versus 27% versus 17%), and coronary flow reserve (14% versus 11% versus 4%), as well as a greater reduction of IL-12 (-25% versus -4% versus -2%), malondialdehyde (-27% versus +5% versus +26%), and NT-proBNP(-26% versus -13.6% versus 9.1%) and increase of fetuin-a (P<0.01). Pulse wave velocity and augmentation index were improved only after anti-IL-12\/23 treatment and correlated with changes in global longitudinal strain, LV twisting-untwisting (P<0.05).\nIn psoriasis, IL-12\/23 inhibition results in a greater improvement of coronary, arterial, and myocardial function than TNF-\u03b1 inhibition or cyclosporine treatment.\nURL: http:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov.
