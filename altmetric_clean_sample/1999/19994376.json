The as-prepared samples were characterized by various techniques to find different forms of carbon phases, including graphite nanosheets, few-layer graphene, and especially, mono-layer graphene with good crystallinity. Delicate control of energy injection is critical for graphene nanosheet formation, whereas mono-layer graphene was produced under the charging voltage of 22.5-23.5 kV. On the basis of electrical wire explosion and our experimental results, the underlying mechanism that governs the graphene generation was carefully illustrated. This work provides a simple but innovative route for producing graphene nanosheets.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000823d","authors":["Xin Gao","Chunxiao Xu","Hao Yin","Xiaoguang Wang","Qiuzhi Song","Peng-Wan Chen","Pengwan Chen"],"doi":"10.1039\/c7nr01647f","first_seen_on":"2017-05-10T06:39:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2040-3364","2040-3372"],"issue":"30","journal":"Nanoscale","last_mentioned_on":1505833319,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1039\/c7nr01647f","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2017\/NR\/C7NR01647F"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2017\/nr\/c7nr01647f","pmid":"28541362","pubdate":"2017-05-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"10639","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Preparation of Graphene by Electrical Explosion of Graphite Sticks","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preparation-graphene-electrical-explosion-graphite-sticks"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8436356,"mean":7.0937825748122,"rank":6400913,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1146793,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8436356,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249493,"mean":12.586117783335,"rank":176204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":46229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249493,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2305,"mean":4.6126015625,"rank":1371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2305,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152,"mean":4.2343841059603,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Physics and Astronomy":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/2DResearch\/statuses\/910157025048440833","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19994376],"posted_on":"2017-09-19T15:01:59+00:00","author":{"name":"2D Graphene Research","url":"http:\/\/2Dresearch.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/893097029915693056\/14zfjd8Q_normal.jpg","description":"Curated content from the leading authority on #graphene research, commercialization and advice.","id_on_source":"2DResearch","tweeter_id":"607958778","geo":{"lt":53.48095,"ln":-2.23743,"country":"GB"},"followers":5236},"tweet_id":"910157025048440833"}]}}
