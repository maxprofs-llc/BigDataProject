The AoMan5A contains a predicted family 1 carbohydrate binding module (CBM-1), located at its N-terminal. The AoMan5A, AoMan5B and truncated mutant AoMan5A\u0394CL (truncating the N-terminal CBM and linker of AoMan5A) were expressed retaining the N-terminus of the native protein in Pichia pastoris GS115 by pPIC9K(M). The specific enzyme activity of the purified reAoMan5A, reAoMan5B and reAoMan5A\u0394CL towards locust bean gum at pH 3.6 and 40\u00b0C for 10min, was 8.3, 104.2 and 15.8U\/mg, respectively. The temperature properties of the reAoMan5A\u0394CL were improved by truncating CBM. They can degrade the pretreated konjac flour and produce prebiotics. In addition, they had excellent stability under simulative gastric fluid and simulative prilling process. All these properties make these recombinant \u03b2-mannanases potential additives for use in the food and feed industries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f2","authors":["Cun-Duo Tang","Hong-Ling Shi","Qing-Hai Tang","Jun-Shi Zhou","Lun-Guang Yao","Zhu-Jin Jiao","Yun-Chao Kan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.enzmictec.2016.08.003","first_seen_on":"2017-05-10T10:22:05+00:00","issns":["01410229"],"journal":"Enzyme & Microbial Technology","last_mentioned_on":1494493522,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27702490?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27702490","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Genome mining and motif truncation of glycoside hydrolase family 5 endo -\u03b2-1,4-mannanase encoded by Aspergillus oryzae RIB40 for potential konjac flour hydrolysis or feed additive","type":"article","volume":"93-94","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genome-mining-motif-truncation-glycoside-hydrolase-family-5-endo%CE%B214mannanase-encoded-aspergillus-ory"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187659,"mean":6.9230329122133,"rank":5925173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1971401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187659,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238077,"mean":12.40444343823,"rank":154680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":69562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238077,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":308,"mean":1.4715504885993,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":308,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.5222222222222,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
