Think again. Non-canonical translational mechanisms abound. #Miami #Science","5'-AUG initiation codon compensates for weak SD","Shine Dalgarno, call the office...Translation start by non-canonical mechanisms"],"citation":{"abstract":"Alternative translation initiation mechanisms, distinct from the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence-dependent mechanism, are more prevalent in bacteria than once anticipated. Translation of Escherichia coliptrB instead requires an AUG triplet at the 5'-terminus of its messenger RNA (mRNA). The 5'-terminal AUG (5'-uAUG) acts as a ribosomal recognition signal to attract ribosomes to the ptrB mRNA rather than functioning as an initiation codon to support translation of an upstream open reading frame. ptrB expression exhibits a stronger dependence on the 5'-uAUG than the predicted SD sequence; however, strengthening the predicted ptrB SD sequence relieves the necessity for the 5'-uAUG. Additional sequences within the ptrB 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) work cumulatively with the 5'-uAUG to control expression of the downstream ptrB coding sequence (CDS) thereby compensating for the weak SD sequence. Replacement of 5'-UTRs from other mRNAs with the ptrB 5'-UTR sequence shows a similar dependence on the 5'-uAUG for CDS expression, suggesting that the regulatory features contained within the ptrB 5'-UTR are sufficient to control the expression of other E. coli CDSs. Demonstration that the 5'-uAUG present on the ptrB leadered mRNA is involved in ribosome binding and expression of the downstream ptrB CDS reveals a novel form of translational regulation. Due to the abundance of AUG triplets at the 5'-termini of E. coli mRNAs and the ability of the ptrB 5'-UTR regulation to function independent of gene context, the regulatory effects of 5'-uAUGs on downstream CDS may be widespread throughout the E. coli genome.IMPORTANCE As the field of synthetic biology continues to grow, a complete understanding of basic biological principles will be necessary. The increasing complexity of the synthetic systems will highlight the gaps in our current knowledge of RNA regulation. This study demonstrates that there are novel ways to regulate canonical Shine-Dalgarno led mRNAs in Escherichia coli, illustrating that our understanding of the fundamental process of translation and RNA regulation is still incomplete. Even in E. coli, one of the most studied model organisms, genes with translation initiation mechanisms that do not fit the canonical Shine-Dalgarno sequence paradigm are being revealed. Uncovering diverse mechanisms that control translational expression will allow synthetic biologists to finely tune protein production of desired gene products.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cba","authors":["Heather J Beck","Gary R Janssen","Heather J.
