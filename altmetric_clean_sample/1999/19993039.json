Before and after treatment, the volunteers underwent adipose tissue biopsies to measure the total (CD68(+)), pro- (CD14(+) = M1), and anti- (CD206(+) = M2) inflammatory macrophages, crown-like structures, and senescent cells, as well as a 2-step pancreatic clamping with a [U-(13)C]palmitate infusion to determine the insulin concentration needed to suppress palmitate flux by 50% (IC50(palmitate)f).Results: In the \u03c9-3 group, the EPA and DHA contributions to plasma free fatty acids increased (P = 0.0003 and P = 0.003, respectively), as did the EPA and DHA content in adipose tissue (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Despite increases in adipose and plasma EPA and DHA in the \u03c9-3 group, there were no significant changes in the IC50(palmitate)f (19 \u00b1 2 compared with 24 \u00b1 3 \u03bcIU\/mL), adipose macrophages (total: 31 \u00b1 2\/100 adipocytes compared with 33 \u00b1 2\/100 adipocytes; CD14(+): 13 \u00b1 2\/100 adipocytes compared with 14 \u00b1 2\/100 adipocytes; CD206(+): 28 \u00b1 2\/100 adipocytes compared with 29 \u00b1 3\/100 adipocytes), crown-like structures (1 \u00b1 0\/10 images compared with 1 \u00b1 0\/10 images), or senescent cells (4% \u00b1 1% compared with 4% \u00b1 1%). There were no changes in these outcomes in the placebo group.Conclusions: Six months of high-dose \u03c9-3 supplementation raised plasma and adipose \u03c9-3 fatty acid concentrations but had no beneficial effects on adipose tissue lipolysis or inflammation in insulin-resistant adults. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01686568.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005700","authors":["Kazanna C Hames","Maria Morgan-Bathke","Debra A Harteneck","Lendia Zhou","John D Port","Ian R Lanza","Michael D Jensen"],"doi":"10.3945\/ajcn.116.148114","first_seen_on":"2017-05-10T05:43:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0002-9165","1938-3207"],"journal":"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1494388500,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3945\/ajcn.116.148114"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/early\/2017\/04\/18\/ajcn.116.148114.full.pdf","pmid":"28424185","publisher":"American Society for Nutrition","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Very-long-chain \u03c9 -3 fatty acid supplements and adipose tissue functions: a randomized controlled trial","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/verylongchain-i%CF%89i-3-fatty-acid-supplements-adipose-tissue-functions-randomized-controlled-trial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183022,"mean":6.92160443679,"rank":7081514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183022,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237802,"mean":12.404432193304,"rank":193353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237802,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5980,"mean":26.926606121425,"rank":5625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5980,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":38.652780487805,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1523213637710781&id=221736504525174","license":"public","citation_ids":[19993039],"posted_on":"2017-05-10T03:55:00+00:00","summary":"High dose omega-3 supplementation doesn't deliver in 6-months study\n\n\"Six months of high-dose \u03c9-3 supplementation raised plasma and adipose \u03c9-3 fatty acid concentrations but had no beneficial effects on adipose tissue lipolysis or inflammation in insulin-r","author":{"name":"SuppVersity","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/221736504525174","facebook_wall_name":"SuppVersity","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/221736504525174\/picture","id_on_source":"221736504525174"}}]}}
