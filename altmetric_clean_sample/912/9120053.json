However, current methods for measurement of gastric pH provide significant stress to animals and humans.\nThe objective of this study is to establish an easy and reliable gastric pH measurement method by determining (13)CO2 concentration in expired air of monkeys, dogs, and rats after oral administration of Ca(13)CO3.\nA correlation of (13)CO2 concentration determined by a Ca(13)CO3 breath test with gastric pH just before Ca(13)CO3 administration was analyzed in the 3 animal species. The equations and contribution ratios of regression line were calculated from logarithmic (13)CO2 concentrations at 15min after administration of Ca(13)CO3 using the linear regression analysis.\nThe (13)CO2 concentration in the Ca(13)CO3 breath test was well correlated with the gastric pH just before Ca(13)CO3 administration in the 3 animal species (r=-0.977 to -0.952). The equations of regression line between the (13)CO2 concentration and the gastric pH in each animal species showed good contribution ratios (R(2)\u22650.89).\nThe Ca(13)CO3 breath test is an informative tool to estimate gastric pH in animals and will be applicable as a new noninvasive tool for patients with GERD\/PPI-resistant symptoms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000712d","authors":["Kazuki Tobita","Makoto Inada","Asuka Sato","Kimiyoshi Sudoh","Hitoshi Sato"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.dld.2016.06.022","first_seen_on":"2016-06-29T15:44:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["15908658","1878-3562"],"journal":"Digestive and Liver Disease","last_mentioned_on":1467210229,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1590865816304819"],"pmid":"27436486","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Estimation of Gastric pH in Cynomolgus Monkeys, Rats, and Dogs using [13C]-Calcium Carbonate Breath Test","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/estimation-gastric-ph-cynomolgus-monkeys-rats-dogs-using-13ccalcium-carbonate-breath-test"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7965219,"mean":6.7280072798953,"rank":6893085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7965219,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261240,"mean":11.53819693078,"rank":219177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261240,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":745,"mean":2.1992768817204,"rank":494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":745,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.595,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
