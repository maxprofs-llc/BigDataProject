We aimed to assess the DHA status among Chinese pregnant and lactating women residing areas differing in the availability of aquatic products. In total, 1211 women in mid-pregnancy (17 \u00b1 2 weeks), late pregnancy (39 \u00b1 2 weeks), or lactation (42 \u00b1 7 days) were enrolled from Weihai (coastland), Yueyang (lakeland), and Baotou (inland) city, with approximately 135 women in each participant group by region. DHA concentrations were measured using capillary gas chromatography, and are reported as weight percent of total fatty acids. Mean plasma DHA concentrations were higher in coastland (mid-pregnancy 3.19%, late pregnancy 2.54%, lactation 2.24%) and lakeland women (2.45%, 1.95%, 2.26%) than inland women (2.25%, 1.67%, 1.68%) (p values < 0.001). Similar differences were observed for erythrocyte DHA. We conclude that DHA concentrations of Chinese pregnant and lactating women are higher in coastland and lakeland regions than in inland areas. DHA status in the study population appears to be stronger than populations from other countries studied to date.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6573cf058f610009228","authors":["Li, You","Li, Hong-Tian","Trasande, Leonardo","Ge, Hua","Yu, Li-Xia","Xu, Gao-Sheng","Bai, Man-Xi","Liu, Jian-Meng"],"doi":"10.3390\/nu7105428","endpage":"8732","first_seen_on":"2016-06-29T22:07:49+00:00","issns":["2072-6643"],"issue":"10","journal":"Nutrients","last_mentioned_on":1467237670,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26506380?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26506380","pubdate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"8723","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"DHA in Pregnant and Lactating Women from Coastland, Lakeland, and Inland Areas of China: Results of a DHA Evaluation in Women (DEW) Study","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dha-pregnant-lactating-women-coastland-lakeland-inland-areas-china-results-dha-evaluation-women-dew"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7965219,"mean":6.7280072798953,"rank":6893083,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7965219,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261241,"mean":11.538032567753,"rank":219168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261241,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2429,"mean":13.675086490939,"rank":2152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2429,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172,"mean":23.147602339181,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Other":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/libroazuln\/statuses\/748275140035649539","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9126431],"posted_on":"2016-06-29T22:01:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":161},"tweet_id":"748275140035649539"}]}}
