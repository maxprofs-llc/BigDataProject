This process generates lipid fragmentation products including malondialdehyde (MDA), an archetypal marker of PUFA oxidation. We observed transient increases in levels of endogenous MDA in wounded Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, raising the possibility that MDA is metabolized. We developed a rigorous ion exchange method to purify enzymatically generated 13C- and 14C-MDA. Delivered as a volatile to intact plants, MDA was efficiently incorporated into lipids. Mass spectral and genetic analyses identified the major chloroplast galactolipid: \u03b1-linolenic acid (18:3)-7Z,10Z,13Z-hexadecatrienoic acid (16:3)-monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (18:3-16:3-MGDG) as an end-product of MDA incorporation. Consistent with this, the fad3-2 fad7-2 fad8 mutant that lacks tri-unsaturated fatty acids incorporated 14C-MDA into 18:2-16:2-MGDG. Saponification of 14C-labelled 18:3-16:3-MGDG revealed 84% of 14C-label in the acyl groups with the remaining 16% in the head group. 18:3-16:3-MGDG is enriched proximal to photosystem II and is likely a major in vivo source of MDA in photosynthetic tissues. We propose that nonenzymatically generated lipid fragments such as MDA are recycled back into plastidic galactolipids that, in their role as cell protectants, can again be fragmented into MDA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Emanuel Schmid-Siegert","Olga Stepushenko","Gaetan Glauser","Edward E.
