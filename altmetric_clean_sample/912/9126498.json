On the one hand, apps for various health related purposes, e.g. interventions for specific conditions as prevention are themselves being evaluated using different methods. On the other hand, apps are also increasingly becoming popular as tools aiding researchers in (clinical) studies. The presented paper aims at providing a short overview of the current situation in both areas, highlighting potential benefits, but also potentially problematic aspects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67f3cf058f6100098a4","authors":["von Jan, Ute","Albrecht, Urs-Vito"],"first_seen_on":"2016-06-29T22:11:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0926-9630"],"journal":"Studies in Health Technology & Informatics","last_mentioned_on":1467237809,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27350516?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27350516","pubdate":"2016-06-30T22:02:35+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","medicalinformatics"],"title":"Apps for Research and Research with Apps - Taking Inventory.","type":"article","volume":"226"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7965219,"mean":6.7280072798953,"rank":6893082,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7965219,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261240,"mean":11.538072140836,"rank":219167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261240,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1104,"mean":1.6887234814143,"rank":851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1104,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":1.04604,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/doctick\/statuses\/748275725187293184","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9126498],"posted_on":"2016-06-29T22:03:29+00:00","author":{"name":"doctick","url":"http:\/\/doctick.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/502911606083166208\/Mo60jRB-_normal.png","description":"Working on medical online calculators and automated notification systems for science articles & #healtcareIT trends...","id_on_source":"doctick","tweeter_id":"2295768584","geo":{"lt":41.38879,"ln":2.15899,"country":"ES"},"followers":253},"tweet_id":"748275725187293184"}]}}
