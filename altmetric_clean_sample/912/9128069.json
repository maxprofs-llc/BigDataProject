NPC is characterized by distant metastasis and poor prognosis. The pathophysiological mechanism of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is unknown. This study aimed to identify the crucial miRNAs in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and their target genes, and to discover the potential mechanism of nasopharyngeal carcinoma development. MATERIAL AND METHODS Microarray expression profiling of miRNA and mRNA from the Gene Expression Omnibus database was downloaded, and we performed a significance analysis of differential expression. An interaction network of miRNAs and target genes was constructed. The underlying function of differentially expressed genes was predicted through Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses. To validate the microarray analysis data, significantly different expression levels of miRNAs and target genes were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS We identified 27 differentially expressed miRNAs and 982 differentially expressed mRNAs between NPC and normal control tissues. 12 miRNAs and 547 mRNAs were up-regulated and 15 miRNAs and 435 mRNAs were down-regulated in NPC samples. We found a total of 1185 negative correlation pairs between miRNA and mRNA. Differentially expressed target genes were significantly enriched in pathways in cancer, cell cycle, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathways. Significantly differentially expressed miRNAs and genes, such as hsa-miR-205, hsa-miR-18b, hsa-miR-632, hsa-miR-130a, hsa-miR-34b, PIGR, SMPD3, CD22, DTX4, and CDC6, may play essential roles in the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS hsa-miR-205, hsa-miR-18b, hsa-miR-632, hsa-miR-130a, and hsa-miR-34b may be related to the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma by regulating the genes involved in pathways in cancer and cell cycle signaling pathways.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd13","authors":["Liu, Minglei","Zhu, Kangru","Qian, Xinmei","Li, Wei"],"first_seen_on":"2016-06-30T00:31:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1643-3750"],"journal":"Medical science monitor international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","last_mentioned_on":1467284149,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27350400?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27350400?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC4928598","pmid":"27350400","pubdate":"2016-06-30T22:02:37+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Identification of miRNA\/mRNA-Negative Regulation Pairs in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.","type":"article","volume":"22"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7971101,"mean":6.7313029448827,"rank":5757804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1928508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7971101,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260847,"mean":11.544563044861,"rank":167823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":77914,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260847,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":994,"mean":2.6322980866062,"rank":463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":497,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":994,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.0044642857143,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/748306075028361216","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9128069],"posted_on":"2016-06-30T00:04:05+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"748306075028361216"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/748423623824678912","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9128069],"posted_on":"2016-06-30T07:51:11+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
