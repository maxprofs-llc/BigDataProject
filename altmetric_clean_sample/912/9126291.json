The emergence and increasingly widespread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) revitalized keen interest in phage-inspired therapy. SWU1gp39 is a novel gene from mycobacteriophage SWU1 with unknown function. SWU1gp39 expressed in M. smegmatis conferred the host cell increased susceptibility to multiple antibiotics, including isoniazid, erythromycin, norfloxacin, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, rifampicin and vancomycin, and multiple environment stresses such as H2O2, heat shock, low pH and SDS. By using EtBr\/Nile red uptake assays, WT-pAL-gp39 strain showed higher cell wall permeability than control strain WT-pAL. Moreover, the WT-pAL-gp39 strain produced more reactive oxygen species and reduced NAD(+)\/NADH ratio. RNA-Seq transcriptomes of the WT-pAL-gp39 and WT-pAL revealed that the transcription of 867 genes was differentially regulated, including genes associated with lipid metabolism. Taken together, our results implicated that SWU1gp39, a novel gene from mycobacteriophage, disrupted the lipid metabolism of host and increased cell wall permeability, ultimately potentiated the efficacy of multiple antibiotics and stresses against mycobacteria.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Li, Qiming","Zhou, Mingliang","Fan, Xiangyu","Yan, Jianlong","Li, Weimin","Xie, Jianping"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep28701","first_seen_on":"2016-06-29T21:59:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1467241025,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27350398?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4923848","pmid":"27350398","pubdate":"2016-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Antibiotics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Applied microbiology","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"28701","subjects":["science"],"title":"Mycobacteriophage SWU1 gp39 can potentiate multiple antibiotics against Mycobacterium via altering the cell wall permeability","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mycobacteriophage-swu1-gp39-potentiate-multiple-antibiotics-against-mycobacterium-via-altering-cell"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7965219,"mean":6.7280072798953,"rank":5753641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1927062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7965219,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261240,"mean":11.538035201482,"rank":168011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":78045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261240,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32145,"mean":14.921357267297,"rank":22029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":8549,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32145,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3311,"mean":16.805026586103,"rank":2239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3311,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
