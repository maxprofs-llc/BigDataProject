A total of 74 eligible IVF-ICSI cycles in 74 women who underwent endometrial polypectomy on either the day of oocyte pick-up (late polypectomy group, 39 cycles) or the first day of ovarian stimulation (early polypectomy group, 35 cycles) between January 2007 and July 2012 were included in this study. Patient characteristics between early and late polypectomy groups were similar. Total dose and days of recombinant human FSH administered, numbers of retrieved oocytes, mature oocytes, fertilized oocytes, grade 1 or 2 embryos and embryos transferred between the two groups were also similar, as was clinical pregnancy rate per cycle, embryo implantation rate and spontaneous abortion rate between the two groups. Therefore, endometrial polypectomy on the day of oocyte retrieval could be a more patient-friendly option for patients with a large endometrial polyp undergoing IVF-ICSI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f61000345c","authors":["Jei-Won Moon","Chung-Hoon Kim","So-Yun Park","Sung-Hoon Kim","Hee-Dong Chae","Byung-Moon Kang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.rbmo.2016.06.008","first_seen_on":"2016-06-29T21:31:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1472-6491"],"journal":"Reproductive BioMedicine Online","last_mentioned_on":1467235845,"links":["http:\/\/www.rbmojournal.com\/article\/S1472-6483(16)30379-0\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.rbmojournal.com\/article\/S1472648316303790\/pdf","pmid":"27470423","pubdate":"2016-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Comparison of ultrasound-guided endometrial polypectomy carried out on the oocyte retrieval day and the first day of ovarian stimulation in IVF\u2013ICSI cycles","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-ultrasoundguided-endometrial-polypectomy-carried-oocyte-retrieval-day-first-day-ovarian-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7965219,"mean":6.7280072798953,"rank":5753659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1927036,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7965219,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261240,"mean":11.538095682497,"rank":168022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":78030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261240,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":825,"mean":11.682970873786,"rank":554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":825,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":46.07619047619,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
