We examined whether (1) voices could be reliably categorized as good for the radio and (2) these categories could be predicted using acoustic measures.\nMale radio performers (n\u2009=\u200924) and age-matched male controls performed \"The Rainbow Passage\" as if presenting on the radio. Voice samples were rated using a three-stage paired-comparison paradigm by 51 naive listeners and perceptual categories were identified (Study 1), and then analyzed for fundamental frequency, long-term average spectrum, cepstral peak prominence, and pause or spoken-phrase duration (Study 2).\nStudy 1: Good inter-judge reliability was found for perceptual judgments of the best 15 voices (good for radio category, 14\/15\u2009=\u2009radio performers), but agreement on the remaining 33 voices (unranked category) was poor. Study 2: Discriminant function analyses showed that the SD standard deviation of sounded portion duration, equivalent sound level, and smoothed cepstral peak prominence predicted membership of categories with moderate accuracy (R(2)\u2009=\u20090.328).\nRadio performers are heterogeneous for voice quality; good voice quality was judged reliably in only 14 out of 24 radio performers. Current acoustic analyses detected some of the relevant signal properties that were salient in these judgments. More refined perceptual analysis and the use of other perceptual methods might provide more information on the complex nature of judging good voices.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ada","authors":["Samantha Warhurst","Catherine Madill","Patricia McCabe","Sten Ternstr\u00f6m","Edwin Yiu","Robert Heard","Warhurst, Samantha","Madill, Catherine","McCabe, Patricia","Ternstr\u00f6m, Sten","Yiu, Edwin","Heard, Robert"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jvoice.2016.05.016","first_seen_on":"2016-06-29T18:24:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-4588","1557-8658","08921997"],"journal":"Journal of Voice","last_mentioned_on":1482511381,"links":["http:\/\/www.jvoice.org\/article\/S0892-1997(16)30068-6\/abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0892199716300686","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jvoice.2016.05.016"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jvoice.org\/article\/S0892199716300686\/pdf","pmid":"27342753","pubdate":"2016-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Performing Arts And Creative Writing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Health Professions"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Perceptual and Acoustic Analyses of Good Voice Quality in Male Radio Performers","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/perceptual-acoustic-analyses-good-voice-quality-male-radio-performers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":2.35,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7926939,"mean":6.7044594278339,"rank":3230779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4653117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7926939,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260797,"mean":11.535642900964,"rank":96269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":162243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260797,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":735,"mean":2.2111144414169,"rank":151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":735,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":5.1676097560976,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
