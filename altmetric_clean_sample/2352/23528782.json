Probiotics have been widely studied in a variety of gastrointestinal diseases. The most-studied species include Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Saccharomyces. However, a lack of clear guidelines on when to use probiotics and the most effective probiotic for different gastrointestinal conditions may be confusing for family physicians and their patients. Probiotics have an important role in the maintenance of immunologic equilibrium in the gastrointestinal tract through the direct interaction with immune cells. Probiotic effectiveness can be species-, dose-, and disease-specific, and the duration of therapy depends on the clinical indication. There is high-quality evidence that probiotics are effective for acute infectious diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea, hepatic encephalopathy, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Conversely, there is evidence that probiotics are not effective for acute pancreatitis and Crohn disease. Probiotics are safe for infants, children, adults, and older patients, but caution is advised in immunologically vulnerable populations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056f9","authors":["Wilkins, Thad","Sequoia, Jacqueline"],"first_seen_on":"2017-08-09T02:37:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-0650"],"issue":"3","journal":"American Family Physician","last_mentioned_on":1502264433,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28762696?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28762696?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"28762696","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["primaryhealthcare"],"title":"Probiotics for Gastrointestinal Conditions: A Summary of the Evidence.","type":"article","volume":"96","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/probiotics-gastrointestinal-conditions-summary-evidence"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8348788,"mean":7.0413328717018,"rank":4208300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3926104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8348788,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178761,"mean":12.372745222645,"rank":88868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":82031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178761,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1100,"mean":3.5302365787079,"rank":749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1100,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.125,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Other":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/_familymedicine\/statuses\/895111790777913344","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23528782],"posted_on":"2017-08-09T02:37:35+00:00","author":{"name":"IMA Family Medicine","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/familymedicineupdate","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3225607495\/e1c280284532b6b18eb2406267d89cf0_normal.png","description":"Family medicine news and information from the Internet Medical Association","id_on_source":"_familymedicine","tweeter_id":"83873868","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":7102},"tweet_id":"895111790777913344"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Probiotics for Gastrointestinal Conditions: A Summary of the Evidence.","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1420451328010668&id=247598615295951","license":"public","citation_ids":[23528782],"posted_on":"2017-08-09T07:40:33+00:00","summary":"Related Articles\n\nProbiotics for Gastrointestinal Conditions: A Summary of the Evidence. \n\nAm Fam Physician. 2017 Aug 01;96(3):170-178 \n\nAuthors: Wilkins T, Sequoia J \n\nAbstract\n Probiotics contain microorganisms, most of which are bacteria similar to the","author":{"name":"Tom Heston MD","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/247598615295951","facebook_wall_name":"Tom Heston MD","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/247598615295951\/picture","id_on_source":"247598615295951"}}]}}
